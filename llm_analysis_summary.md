Analyzed 74 submissions.

## Top Allies (High Alignment Score)
### Anonymous_3 (Score: 9/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: Both submissions identify threats to democracy and liberal values in Europe and call for urgent, well‑resourced EU action to defend them. They converge on the need for strategic efforts that include strengthening societal resilience through education and civic capacity‑building (including digital literacy).
- **Disagreements**: The other submission is narrowly focused on an education‑centred response as the primary remedy, while the other takes a much broader approach that prioritises regulatory enforcement, institutional reform, strategic investment in technology and research, procurement and defence/industrial measures, and climate/biosecurity preparedness. In short, they agree on the problem and the need for resourcing, but differ on scope and the mix of policy instruments to prioritise.

### EUPHA European Public Health Association (Score: 8/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: They both prioritise embedding strategic foresight into EU policymaking, calling for longer-term scenario planning, capacity building, and institutional mechanisms to ensure foresight informs decisions. Both endorse cross-sector collaboration (linking health, climate and digital policy), use of AI-driven early-warning/weak-signal detection, and translating foresight outputs into concrete policy actions to strengthen resilience.
- **Disagreements**: They differ in sectoral emphasis and policy focus: one submission foregrounds technology/strategic-autonomy measures (defence and tech sovereignty, procurement reform, biofoundries) and explicit research and governance for climate interventions, while the other concentrates on health-sector priorities (ageing, pandemic preparedness, AMR, health infrastructure) and normative questions in health prioritisation. As a result, they place different weight on security and industrial policy actions versus a health-centred, equity-oriented foresight agenda.

### Matthew Spaniol (Score: 8/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: Both submissions prioritise strengthening strategic foresight and learning-by-doing: they support using foresight to monitor outcomes, generate early warnings, and adapt policy based on evidence. Each endorses iterative policy-making, emphasising experimentation, feedback loops and methods to detect when policies fail so they can be corrected promptly.
- **Disagreements**: One submission foregrounds a provisional, epistemic approach to policy—treating measures explicitly as experiments, centring falsification and lightweight, easily-reversible designs—while the other emphasises building durable institutional capacity (centralised enforcement, mission-driven research, procurement reform) and advancing specific sectoral strategies (AI, biotech, SRM, mental health). The difference is therefore mainly one of priority and emphasis: broad methodological humility and minimal permanence versus targeted, structural reforms and comprehensive governance frameworks.

### AMALIA MARIA KOUTSOGIANNI (Score: 8/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: Both submissions prioritise strengthening youth resilience through education, mental-health measures, and improved digital literacy and critical thinking to manage disinformation and technological change. Both call for meaningful youth participation and institutional mechanisms to ensure young generations’ voices and long-term interests are represented in policymaking.
- **Disagreements**: They differ mainly in scope and emphasis: one adopts a wide-ranging, technology- and security‑oriented resilience agenda (including AI, climate interventions, biotech, procurement and defence/competitiveness measures), while the other focuses narrowly on social and economic stability for young people (decent work, affordable housing, healthcare, and targeted education reforms). Consequently they prioritise different policy instruments — systemic industrial/regulatory reforms versus social protection, labour-market and participatory measures — though these priorities are complementary rather than directly opposed.

### Gaël QUEINNEC (Score: 8/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: Both submissions identify environmental (climate), geopolitical, and technological (AI/digital) challenges as central to EU resilience and call for a more proactive, forward-looking conception of resilience. They converge on the need to broaden participation in foresight processes to include non-governmental stakeholders, specifically enterprise and private-sector foresight practitioners or clusters. Both also signal support for reframing resilience thinking beyond narrow short-term responses toward stronger, future-oriented approaches.
- **Disagreements**: They differ in emphasis and level of detail: one submission advances specific policy instruments (regulatory enforcement, procurement reform, public‑funded research priorities, SRM governance, biosecurity measures, and mental‑health‑in‑all‑policies) while the other focuses narrowly on process improvements (bringing industry foresight into collective intelligence sessions) and on clarifying conceptual framing (advocating the term 'anti‑fragility'). There is a potential tension over stakeholder balance: one leans strongly toward public‑interest safeguards, precaution, and inclusive citizen deliberation, whereas the other prioritises greater direct involvement of corporate/enterprise foresight networks and a language of performance and sovereignty.

### Sanja Terlevic (Score: 8/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: Both submissions prioritise strengthening democratic legitimacy of policymaking through meaningful citizen inclusion and participatory processes, including mechanisms for public engagement and deliberation. They also converge on the need for adaptive, experimental policy tools (e.g., safe/controlled experimentation or sandboxes) and agile policy frameworks that can respond quickly to emerging challenges while maintaining democratic standards.
- **Disagreements**: Submission A places strong emphasis on specific technical and security priorities — enforcement capacity, strategic R&D investment, procurement reform, tech and defence sovereignty, biosecurity, and governance/research of climate interventions (SRM) — and prescribes concrete institutional and funding measures. Submission B is high-level and primarily concentrates on accessibility, co‑creation, and low‑risk policy experimentation without advancing sector‑specific security, industrial or scientific governance prescriptions.

### Kieran DALTON (Score: 8/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: Both submissions prioritise forward-looking strategic foresight as essential to shaping Europe’s trajectory to 2040 and stress the need to strengthen resilience through intra‑EU consolidation and an active, results‑oriented neighbourhood policy. They share emphasis on investing in R&D, education and key emerging technologies (including AI) and on mobilising citizens and societal participation to build durable social and technological capacity.
- **Disagreements**: They diverge in emphasis and granularity: one submission focuses on institutional and regulatory reforms (enforcement bodies, procurement reform, mission‑driven research, biosecurity, and detailed governance for climate interventions like SRM) and on specific technical domains (biotech, neurotech, climate science) and quantitative foresight tools, while the other stresses urgent geopolitical consolidation, creating prosperity in neighbouring regions, renewable energy and space technologies, and bottom‑up social innovation without prescribing complex governance architectures. There is also a difference in tone on the role of large corporations versus grassroots societal engagement and on the balance between rapid, short‑term geopolitical responses and long‑term systemic capacity‑building.

### Melanoma Patient Network Europe (Score: 8/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: Both stress the central role of robust science, evidence-based decision-making, and ethics in strengthening European resilience. They agree on the need to invest in education and scientific literacy to counter misinformation and improve public health and democratic outcomes. Both call for sustained public engagement and leadership that embody moral values and critical thinking.
- **Disagreements**: One submission takes a broad, systems-level approach that prioritises strategic foresight, technological sovereignty, defence and industrial policy, climate-intervention research/governance, and specific R&D and procurement reforms, while the other focuses narrowly on education, ethics and scientific literacy as the primary lever for resilience. There is a difference in emphasis on resource allocation and policy instruments: one advocates proactive research into potentially controversial technologies and institutional enforcement mechanisms, whereas the other prioritises societal-level literacy, ethics and countering pseudoscience without detailing techno-industrial or security measures.

### EuroStack Project (Score: 7/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: Both submissions prioritise European technological sovereignty, stronger investment in R&D and skills, and using public procurement and standards to build domestic capabilities. They agree on the need for stronger cybersecurity, interoperable open standards, and improving the Commission’s strategic foresight and scenario planning to inform long-term resilience.
- **Disagreements**: They differ on approach and scope: one submission advocates mission-driven, centrally coordinated institutions and broader coverage of climate interventions, biotech, defence and enforcement bodies, while the other prioritises a bottom-up, Open Source First stack, SME-led procurement and explicitly rejects hyperscaler-led models like the current Gaia‑X approach. There are also different emphases on governance trade-offs — centralised enforcement and large pan‑EU facilities versus decentralized community-driven development and market-based financing for open-source components.

### GROUPE VYV (Score: 7/10)
- **Verdict**: Likely Ally
- **Agreements**: Both submissions emphasise the centrality of climate risk and its health consequences, including worsening mental health and the rise of infectious diseases, and call for stronger strategic foresight, research and preparedness. They also agree on the need to protect vulnerable populations, integrate health into broader policy-making, and strengthen resilient supply chains and local capacity for essential goods and services.
- **Disagreements**: The Centre for Future Generations prioritises technology and strategic autonomy at EU level (e.g., pan‑European AI research infrastructure, enforcement bodies, biofoundries, SRM research and export controls) and frames resilience through geopolitics, defence and regulated tech development. Groupe VYV instead focuses on community and mutualist responses, social protection, access to care, food systems, local adaptation measures and frugality, expressing greater caution about large‑scale technological roll-outs and stressing decentralised, solidaristic instruments.

## Top Opponents/Divergent (Low Alignment Score)
### Davy Anthonissen (Score: 1/10)
- **Verdict**: Opponent
- **Agreements**: Both submissions stress the need for a stronger, more capable Europe able to respond to geopolitical threats and to reduce strategic dependence on external actors. Each calls for enhancing European security and capacity at an EU-relevant level.
- **Disagreements**: They diverge fundamentally on means, norms and policy priorities: one emphasizes democratic governance, rule-of-law, multilateralism, careful regulation of emerging technologies, climate and societal resilience, and investment in R&D and institutions; the other advocates unilateral, extra-legal measures such as territorial annexation, civilian arming/militia structures, and transactional fixes that contravene international norms. Their policy focus and values are therefore largely incompatible, with one prioritising long-term, systemic resilience and institutional safeguards and the other prioritising immediate militarised expansion and ad hoc security measures.

### Esteban Carlos Borzino (Score: 2/10)
- **Verdict**: Opponent
- **Agreements**: Both emphasise the importance of economic dynamism, competitiveness and functioning markets, and express concern that policy choices can produce long-term harms if poorly designed. Both invoke democratic legitimacy and the rule of law as foundational to prosperous societies.
- **Disagreements**: One submission calls for active public action: stronger regulation and enforcement, mission-driven public R&D, strategic procurement, and targeted state-led measures to manage systemic risks and build resilience. The other rejects interventionism, arguing for minimal state involvement, rapid rollback of crisis-era controls, and primacy of private property and market freedom, resulting in a fundamental disagreement over the role of the state in innovation, risk management and economic policy.

### VLAD HERES (Score: 3/10)
- **Verdict**: Opponent
- **Agreements**: Both submissions prioritise strengthening Europe’s strategic autonomy: reducing critical dependencies (in technology, energy and supply chains), investing in domestic R&D and manufacturing, and beefing up defence and procurement capacity. They also share concern about foreign influence and disinformation campaigns undermining European security and democratic processes, and call for stronger institutional capacity to respond to these threats.
- **Disagreements**: They sharply diverge on means and values: one submission advocates rights‑respecting, multilateral, transparent and precautionary approaches (including democratic oversight, public participation, research governance and social fairness), whereas the other prioritises hardline, unilateral and often coercive measures (cyberattacks, sabotage, deportations, immediate military action and purges of foreign influence). They also disagree on social policy and civil liberties — one emphasises inclusion, mental‑health and intergenerational equity, the other promotes exclusionary immigration policies and alignment with far‑right rhetoric.

### Anonymous_6 (Score: 3/10)
- **Verdict**: Opponent
- **Agreements**: Both submissions prioritise protecting and strengthening social goods—notably healthcare, social protection and environmental sustainability—and express concern about the erosion of public services and social safety nets. Both call for greater democratic accountability and for policymaking to better reflect citizens’ needs and well‑being.
- **Disagreements**: They sharply diverge on security and investment priorities: one advocates bolstering defence/strategic autonomy (including onshoring defence production and mobilising investment vehicles) and active tech and procurement policies, while the other rejects investment in armaments and opposes diverting public/pension funds to military purposes. They also differ on fiscal and institutional approaches: one proposes using public and private capital (including pension capital) to finance strategic R&D and resilience infrastructure, whereas the other insists pension and savings must be preserved for retirees and redirected instead toward social services.

### José Luis Rajab_1 (Score: 3/10)
- **Verdict**: Opponent
- **Agreements**: Both submissions call for stronger EU-level legal and enforcement capacity and greater strategic autonomy, including more robust common rules and enhanced defence capabilities at the EU level. They share an interest in the EU having more global influence and the ability to act cohesively on security and strategic industrial policy.
- **Disagreements**: They diverge sharply on values and methods: Submission B advances exclusionary, xenophobic and unilateral policies (e.g., banning entry of Muslims, punitive trade isolation, hostility toward certain governments), while Submission A emphasizes democratic safeguards, human rights, multilateralism, inclusive deliberation, and rights-respecting governance of technology and climate policy. Submission A prefers evidence-based, precautionary and cooperative approaches (e.g., transparent research, international norms, participatory forums), whereas Submission B advocates nationalist, protectionist and punitive measures that would conflict with those approaches.

### Antonio Mincarini (Score: 3/10)
- **Verdict**: Neutral
- **Agreements**: Both submissions prioritise citizen welfare, social solidarity, and protection of people from harm, emphasising wellbeing and reducing poverty as key goals. They also share a common opposition to unnecessary wars and a stated desire to enhance the protection of citizens.
- **Disagreements**: They diverge sharply on environmental and public‑health priorities: Submission B calls for 'less green' policies and fewer vaccines, whereas Submission A emphasises robust climate action, preparedness (including research on interventions) and strengthening biosecurity and vaccine/biomanufacturing capacity. Submission A also emphasises stronger regulatory frameworks, enforcement, and proactive technology governance and strategic foresight, which contrasts with Submission B’s emphasis on individual freedom and reduced regulatory emphasis on ‘green’ agendas.

### Ivana Nemčicová (Score: 3/10)
- **Verdict**: Opponent
- **Agreements**: Both submissions prioritise strengthening Europe’s industrial and technological capacity, including support for domestic tech development and maintaining competitiveness. They share concerns about governance and rule of law, and express interest in stronger enforcement or more effective institutions to protect European interests and values. Both also show wariness about foreign influence in technology and an interest in data/privacy protections for citizens.
- **Disagreements**: They sharply diverge on climate and energy policy: one advocates decarbonisation, proactive climate resilience and regulated research on climate interventions, while the other calls for halting the Green Deal, preserving combustion-based infrastructure, and resuming cheap energy imports. They differ on strategic dependencies and geopolitics: one stresses strategic autonomy, multilateral governance and caution about reliance on rivals, the other prioritises pragmatic trade (including with Russia) and rejects current EU policy directions. They also prioritise social policy differently — one emphasises inclusive, intergenerational governance and mental-health-in-all-policies, while the other emphasises stricter border control and a return to traditional economic/diplomatic priorities.

### José Luis Rajab (Score: 3/10)
- **Verdict**: Opponent
- **Agreements**: Both submissions call for stronger EU-level capacities: more coherent common laws or legislation across member states and greater European strategic autonomy in defence and international influence. Each expresses a desire for the EU to act with greater unity and assertiveness on the world stage to protect European interests.
- **Disagreements**: They diverge sharply on values and means: one submission emphasises democratic safeguards, human rights, inclusive and multilateral governance, evidence-based research, and precautionary regulation of emerging technologies; the other advances exclusionary, xenophobic immigration policies, targeted hostility toward specific external governments and groups, and unilateral protectionist retaliation. The priorities and policy instruments therefore differ profoundly—cooperative, rights-respecting governance versus nationalist, coercive and discriminatory approaches.

### Negar RIAHI (Score: 4/10)
- **Verdict**: Neutral
- **Agreements**: Both submissions support the development and uptake of biotechnology-based innovations for health and stress the importance of regulatory evaluation and market access (CE/FDA approval and health‑economic assessment). They also converge on the idea that new bio-based materials and medical technologies should be considered within healthcare procurement and national evaluation processes. 
- **Disagreements**: Submission B is a narrow, product-level advocacy for fast adoption of a specific dental hydroxyapatite resin and emphasizes immediate clinical use and procurement, often making strong efficacy claims; Submission A takes a systemic, risk‑aware stance, prioritising mission‑driven public research, biosecurity, enforcement, independent evidence generation and precaution. CFG stresses strategic priorities (strategic autonomy, biofoundry networks, export controls, governance of dual‑use biotech and broader foresight tools) that are largely absent from the product-focused submission, which does not engage with biosecurity, governance or large-scale resilience planning.

### Anonymous_7 (Score: 4/10)
- **Verdict**: Neutral
- **Agreements**: Both submissions value more inclusive and accessible public participation: they support lowering barriers so a wider range of people (including shy or marginalised voices) can engage. Each endorses remote or low-friction participation mechanisms and capacity-building to broaden stakeholder input into discussions and decision-making.
- **Disagreements**: One submission is narrowly focused on practical, grassroots measures (more webinars and anonymity-friendly formats) to increase participation, while the other prioritises systemic policy, institutional reforms, technical governance, and large-scale research investments across multiple sectors. They therefore differ sharply in scope, scale, and policy priorities: one emphasizes immediate, low-cost engagement tools; the other emphasizes structural regulatory, research and enforcement actions that the short submission does not address.
