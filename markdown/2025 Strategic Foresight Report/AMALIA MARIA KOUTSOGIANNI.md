feedback: 'The 2025 Strategic Foresight Report should highlight the need for systematic
  EU policy action in the field of youth resilience, as a key pillar of sustainability,
  social cohesion, and the future competitiveness of the Union. Young generations
  are called upon to navigate multiple, simultaneous crises climate change, technological
  transformation, geopolitical uncertainties, and demographic challenges. Notably,
  63% of the jobs that will exist by 2030 have not yet been created, while 35% of
  the skills currently in demand will have completely changed by 2027 (source: World
  Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report, 2023). This rapid transformation of the labour
  market intensifies uncertainty about the future of young people and requires an
  immediate and coordinated policy response. Therefore, it is proposed that a comprehensive
  European Strategy for the "Resilience of Young Generations" be introduced, based
  on three key pillars: Education for resilience and critical thinking Upgrading educational
  systems to include skills related to psychological resilience, adaptability, uncertainty
  management, and critical handling of disinformation. Social and economic stability
  Adopting policies that ensure young people have access to decent work, affordable
  housing, and quality healthcare services, supporting their autonomy and enabling
  them to build stable personal and professional futures. Participation and empowerment
  Strengthening the institutional role of youth in decision-making processes, through
  mechanisms for participation and by fostering youth leadership initiatives at both
  national and European levels. A youth resilience strategy is not simply an investment
  in the future; it is a necessary condition for a sustainable European transition,
  for addressing social inequalities, and for maintaining trust in European values
  and institutions.'

llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise strengthening youth resilience through
  education, mental-health measures, and improved digital literacy and critical thinking
  to manage disinformation and technological change. Both call for meaningful youth
  participation and institutional mechanisms to ensure young generations’ voices and
  long-term interests are represented in policymaking.
llm_disagreements: 'They differ mainly in scope and emphasis: one adopts a wide-ranging,
  technology- and security‑oriented resilience agenda (including AI, climate interventions,
  biotech, procurement and defence/competitiveness measures), while the other focuses
  narrowly on social and economic stability for young people (decent work, affordable
  housing, healthcare, and targeted education reforms). Consequently they prioritise
  different policy instruments — systemic industrial/regulatory reforms versus social
  protection, labour-market and participatory measures — though these priorities are
  complementary rather than directly opposed.'
