## Uncovering European Desirable Futures Introduction

In an era of unprecedented transformation, resilience is no longer a reactionary stance but a
proactive, systemic, and cultural strategy. The European Union stands at a crossroads
where resilience must transcend crisis response and become a foundation for redefining
prosperity, democracy, and quality of life in a multipolar world.

This report embraces Radical Optimism and Lucid Optimism as guiding principles. Radical
Optimism is not naive hope—it is a deliberate act of reimagining possibility, asserting that
even within constraints, alternative futures can be designed. Lucid Optimism, as described
by Joël de Rosnay, acknowledges the weight of reality while choosing to act towards beauty,
agency, and meaningful transformation.

Resilience is therefore not just about endurance—it is about reinvention. Whether in
geopolitics, economy, urbanism, or digital governance, the EU must craft a future that is
desirable rather than merely survivable. This requires bold choices, from cultivating cultural
sovereignty and cognitive autonomy to reshaping economic models towards vitality rather
than extraction.

By identifying levers of desirable resilience, this report aims to empower policymakers,
designers, and change-makers with a framework for foresight-driven action—one that does
not merely anticipate but actively designs the future.


## Objectives

To help ensure the EU’s long-term resilience in all relevant policy areas:


  - Connecting different EU policy initiatives under a cohesive resilience strategy.


  - Informing EU policymakers on long-term resilience planning across key areas like

global power, prosperity, quality of life, and democracy.

  - Providing policy recommendations and building on prior foresight work, integrating

new strategies such as the Competitiveness Compass and Preparedness Union
strategy.

## Key questions


**Main Challenges x Main EU strengths to build resilience**
What are the main challenges to long-term EU resilience, and what strengths does Europe
possess to build resilience?

**Resilience Vision for 2040**
How would you characterise a resilient EU in 2040?

**Societal and Intergenerational Resilience**
How can we ensure a resilient society and fairness between generations?

**Critical Policy Actions**
Which key policy actions should be initiated today to strengthen EU resilience by 2040?

**Synergies and Tensions Across Policies**
What crucial synergies and tensions exist between various EU priorities that may help or
hinder long-term resilience? How can these synergies be enhanced and tensions mitigated?

**Optimising Foresight**
How can the European Commission improve its strategic foresight approach to better design
policies for a desirable future?


## Co-Methodology & Approaches Integrative & Dual Foresight

This report builds on a dual foresight approach, blending design research, strategic foresight
and cultural analysis to detect emerging transitions across industries, societies and
ecosystems.

**01 The Designer & Design Researcher Perspective**

Our approach is rooted in the singularity of the designer’s viewpoint, blending speculative,
participatory, and experiential methodologies to explore futures through qualitative depth and
systemic complexity.

We recognise that innovation is not only technological but also artistic, social, and cultural,
demanding multidimensional lenses to anticipate change.

**02 Opening Foresight to Participatory Design**

We combine academic research and business-oriented foresight, ensuring that insights
remain rigorously informed yet pragmatically applicable.

Our foresight is iterative and participatory, engaging stakeholders, creatives, and strategists
in the exploration of plausible, desirable, and speculative futures.

**03 Integrating Cultural Contradictions & Local Manifestations**

We do not only track technological advancements; we also identify the cultural tensions and
emergences shaping transformation.

Weak signals of change are often born at the periphery, in artistic movements, underground
communities, and alternative practices—our methodology prioritises these margins to
anticipate shifts before they reach the mainstream.

**04 Beyond Predictions: Fiction, Potential & Transition**

We apply Strategic Foresight, Fiction-Design, Potential Design, and Transition Design
methodologies to map possibles, probables, and speculative scenarios.

This combinatory approach enables us to identify disruptive trajectories while remaining
adaptive to the nonlinear nature of change.


## Forewords From Designing Potentials to Designing Hope

Research, creation, and design projects are not merely disciplines but “dimensions of
action”—active approaches that are adjacent while also supporting our ongoing transitions
rather than dictating them.

These approaches allow us to:


1. Explore shifting contexts, identifying the forces shaping tomorrow,
2. Perceive their early manifestations, tracing the faint signals of emerging change,
3. Embrace and mitigate uncertainty, integrating complexity rather than resisting it,
4. Act as a force for proposition, offering alternative visions,
5. Combine different methodologies, daring to challenge convention,
6. Impact through new frameworks, embedding transformation at multiple scales,
7. Reframe perspectives and pathways, shaping new narratives,
8. Consciously open towards unexplored futures, expanding the limits of possibility.

These are not static ambitions but assertive, resilient movements that allow us to reimagine
the interdependencies between humans and the planet. Within this shift, resilience emerges
as a foundational principle, unifying these explorations through a commitment to rethinking
the “desirable”—how we live together, how we design transition, and how we empower
agency in times of crisis.

Philosophers, system thinkers, and change scholars such as Joël de Rosnay, Christian
Delécluse, and Michel Serres remind us that we are both the witnesses and the architects of
one of the most significant transformations in human history. We are shifting from a society
of information to a society of recommendation, where collective intelligence, open-source
methodologies, and fluid adaptability—what De Rosnay calls “life streaming” or
“flow”—become essential tools for navigating this change.

This fluidity translates into a necessary reframing of how we educate, innovate, and govern.
We are moving from seasonal cycles to complex, interconnected, and simultaneous societal
movements, where multiple temporalities coexist. To be at the core of transformation is to
question it while simultaneously reshaping its course. As Michel Serres describes in “Petite
Poucette”, today’s generations are no longer defined by historical memberships but by new
relational geographies—expanding beyond national, cultural, and digital boundaries into
networked and shared forms of belonging.

**Envisioning Europe 2040: Towards a Radical and Lucid Optimism**

Design, as both a critical and pragmatic practice, operates in this tension between present
and future. It does not passively accept the status quo but proposes new frameworks,
exploring the subtle interstices where change takes root. This is why we advocate for
Radical and Lucid Optimism—a perspective that acknowledges challenges while deliberately
choosing to amplify beauty, agency, and innovation.


Lucid optimism, as de Rosnay describes, is not about blind idealism but about choosing to
recognise and create moments of transformation, even within crisis. It means navigating
uncertainty as an opportunity, rethinking desirable futures with imagination and
evidence-based foresight.

In this report, we do not merely forecast trends; we highlight key levers of desirable
resilience, crafting future-proof recommendations where innovation is not just a pursuit of the
new, but a vehicle for regenerating meaning, agency, and collective well-being.

## 2040 Global Power United Futures & Resilient Alliance

By 2040, Europe has emerged as a United and Resilient Alliance, leveraging strategic
autonomy, progressive climate leadership, and cultural influence to navigate an increasingly
multipolar world. Despite global fragmentation, the EU has strengthened regional cohesion,
transatlantic partnerships, and alternative trade networks, ensuring its role as a diplomatic,
economic, and cultural force shaping a desirable ground for collectiveness.

**Levers of resilience:**


  - Collective Autonomy & Allyship Value: The EU can reinforce internal cohesion while

expanding global influence through a dual-axis resilience strategy, deepening
regional integration while expanding transatlantic partnerships.

      - Safety Union: With the aim to prioritise self-sufficiency in defence, energy, and

critical supply chains, the EU must establish a collective union integrating
Ukraine and Schengen-border states into a joint resilience pact covering
energy independence, military coordination and supply chain circularity.

     - EU-Canada Pact: Explore regulatory harmonisation for potential EU-Canada

deeper integration from mutual mobility to aligned digital governance and
security collaboration as well as research and development initiatives.

      - Alternative Trading & Expanded Economies: Developing stronger ties with

Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia to create alternative trade routes.


  - Climatic Pioneer & Energy Sovereignty: Reducing dependence on fossil fuels and

permitting the EU to become the world transitional energy pioneer.

     - Hydrogen Sovereignty: Build a EU Hydrogen Sovereignty Act, mandating

reserves to secure autonomy for the next century.

      - Decentralised Energy: Implementing decentralised solar, battery, and

microgrid networks to mitigate centralised power infrastructures blackouts.

      - Plural Durable Mix: Shift defence infrastructure toward transitional and

resilient energy (hydrogen, low-carbon materials, climate-adaptive bases).


  - Cultural Powerhouse: The EU’s art, philosophy, history, and patrimony will become a

geopolitical pillar in the face of decaying American ideals, aligning NATO obligations
with UN-led stability missions. The EU has the potential to adapt and provide new
ideals of desirability for the Western world to adapt and not only embrace but support
a non-western world order, proving its resilience power.

      - European IP: Position European culture, intellectual heritage, and creative

industries as pillars of geopolitical resilience, aligning NATO obligations with
UN-led stability missions while fostering diplomatic bridges beyond Western
hegemony.

      - New ideals of desirability: Frame European cultural innovation as a model for

adaptability, embracing non-Western perspectives and collaborations to
reinforce global stability and shared prosperity.


- Safeguarding heritage: To fully position EU Cultural power, implement a

Cultural Sovereignty Act to protect indigenous traditions, languages and
regional cultural autonomy.

- Mytho-political Narratives: Leverage European cultural mythologies &

archetypes reinvesting in narratives and fictions that transcend populations to
foster a sense of togetherness and communal European strength, positive
future-facing messages and engagement. Bridging tradition and modernity,
offering aspiration that resonate across diverse populations. This approach
might reinforce soft power while inspiring shared vision of the future,
positioning the continent as a global leader in cultural diplomacy.


## 2040 Prosperity: Post-Growth Economy & Vitality Renaissance

By 2040, Europe has redefined prosperity beyond traditional economic metrics, embracing a
Post-Growth Economy & Vitality Renaissance, where well-being, creativity, and ecological
regeneration shape a new model of sustainable abundance. Despite past dependencies on
hyper-industrial capitalism, the EU has successfully transitioned towards ecosystemic vitality,
agronomic sovereignty, and equitable social infrastructures, ensuring that prosperity is
measured not by extraction, but by the thriving of both people and planet.

**Levers of resilience:**


  - From Regenerative to Vital Economy: Reframing economies to target and nurture

ecosystemic vitality indicators: in terms of biodiversity, human health and human
labour:

      - Beyond Neutrality: Regulations should not only focus on preserving but on

how to positively impact regional ecosystems health and vitality, echoing the
“One Health” model, assessing non-human and collective health mentalities.

      - Beyond GPD: Implement ecosystemic vitality indicators spanning biodiversity,

human health and labour resilience, as central metrics of desirable prosperity,
ensuring economic growth aligns with planetary and social regeneration.

     - Low-Tech, Decarbonisation & Regionalised Production: While regulating

compulsory carbon footprint reductions in infrastructures and industrial
developments, incentivise regionalised material sourcing, ensuring economic
and patrimony security. Phase out planned obsolescence by mandating
repairability and circularity in industrial product design, funding low-tech
innovation hubs and biotechnologies VC.

      - Positive Innovation: Establishing guidelines and investment supports to

prioritise innovation initiatives that generate more resources and energy than
it consumes or absorbs.


  - Agronomic Sovereignty: From tackling food security to implementing desirable

agricultural change:

     - Implement EU-wide agronomic sufficiency laws to scale permaculture, and

localised food ecosystems.

      - Empowering citizens when it comes to food security by providing

municipalities with resources to implement community gardens and
aeroponics local farms.


  - Post-Industrial & Durable Natality Policy: To counteract the commodification of fertility

and the impending reproductive crisis, the EU must ensure equitable access to
hormonal health, fertility treatments and sustainable family planning.

      - Financial incentives for durable family planning, addressing the EU’s

population decline without coercive pro-natal strategies but resilient ideals
and infrastructures. Including affordable childcare, flexible work policies and
intergenerational care.


- Recognise endocrine disruptors and environmental toxicity structural issues

by regulating pollutants and investing in preventive hormonal care.


## 2040 Quality of Life & Wellbeing: Regenerative Wellbeing

By 2040, Europe has embraced Regenerative Wellbeing, pioneering a post-productivist
society where slow living, sensory pleasure, and ecological intelligence define a new
standard of quality of life. Despite global instability, the EU has positioned itself as a leader in
human-centred urbanism, equitable healthcare, and cognitive resilience, ensuring that joy,
collective well-being, and intergenerational solidarity become the cornerstones of a thriving
and future-proof society.

**Levers of resilience:**


  - Biophilic & Humane Smart Cities: The future of smart cities must shift from a purely

technocentric approach towards a biophilic and human-scale urbanism, prioritising
quality of life, neighbourhood connectivity, and ecological intelligence over
data-driven optimisation alone.

      - Neighbourhood Networks & Social fabric: Policies should foster localised

interconnectivity where public spaces, services, and communities are
designed to encourage informal interactions, shared resources, and social
cohesion.

      - Biological & Regenerative intelligence: Cities must become living ecosystems,

integrating interspecies-compatible solutions, adaptive architecture, and
decentralised green infrastructures to enhance biodiversity, and urban
well-being. Emerging educational initiatives, such as the Grenoble Master’s in
Urban Planning, reflect this shift, training future planners to work with organic
and symbiotic urban systems.

      - Beyond the Digital Grid: While digital connectivity remains vital, the next

phase of smart urbanism should embrace biophilic intelligence—taking
inspiration from plant networks, fungal mycelium, and ecological
interdependence—to reimagine infrastructure, transport, and housing in a
way that is both technologically advanced and deeply humane.

      - Neuro-Architecture: Integrate neuro-architectural principles into urban

planning and building regulations, ensuring that spatial design actively
enhances cognitive and emotional wellbeing, transforming the built
environment into a public health asset rather than an aesthetic commodity.


  - Leisure & Solidarity Urbanism: Safeguarding collective hedonism by ensuring access

to free cultural spaces, nightlife and nature within urban environments. Investing in
interspecies architecture and “humane”-centric design such as those prioritising joy,
inclusivity and wellbeing to create urban landscapes that foster mental health, social
cohesion and creative expression:


      - Positive Urbanism: The integration of joy-driven urbanism into city planning

should be financially supported, encouraging projects that prioritize communal
engagement, shared experiences, and artistic accessibility.


    - Architectural Joy: Architectural programs like Thomas Heatherwick’s

Humanise campaign at Loughborough University, set to launch in 2025, align
with this vision by reshaping architectural education to focus on emotionally
resonant and socially enriching spaces. The EU can scale similar initiatives to
embed well-being into urban development at a systemic level.

    - Cultural Vibrancy: Public funding mechanisms, including European Urban

Innovation Funds, should support experimental urban projects that blend art,
nature, and communal experiences, reinforcing resilience through cultural
vibrancy.

    - Supporting communities: Incentivise co-inter-poly-trans communities,

fostering multi-generational, cross-cultural, cooperative living models.

    - Neighbourhood networks: Supporting municipalities and cities to build

bridges, platforms and spaces fostering neighbourhood meetings and social
interactions, from architectural extensions to social parks and vegetal spaces.


- Inclusive Housing Models: To counteract increasing social isolation as well as to

address diverse communities needs beyond solely aging populations, EU urban
policies should promote inclusive design, co-living and multi-generational exchange
when it comes to the housing crisis:

    - Legislative incentives for adaptive housing models, including intergenerational

residences, cooperative living spaces, and modular housing, can facilitate
dynamic urban communities that are adaptable to demographic shifts.

    - Cities should integrate public-private partnerships to create shared living

arrangements that blend social care, accessibility, and flexible housing
design, ensuring housing solutions remain inclusive and future-proof.

    - Funding should be directed toward pilot projects that demonstrate the

economic and social benefits of these housing models, fostering
community-driven resilience in urban centers.

    - Adaptive Habitats: Designing public living spaces as well as supporting

inclusive architectural projects when it comes to housing for people with
disabilities, leveraging modular, adaptive and neuro-design practices.


- Equitable Health: To counteract bio-social stratification driven by techno-sovereignty

and biotech-nationalism, EU policies must ensure equitable access to health
innovation, preventing longevity from becoming an exclusive privilege of the
ultra-rich.

    - Decentralised Health Data Governance: A European health data commons

must be established to prevent monopolisation of genetic and biometric
insights by a handful of corporations, ensuring data sovereignty remains in
the hands of citizens and public health institutions.

    - Preventative Climatic Healthcare: Policy focus should shift toward accessible

preventive health ecosystems, addressing climate-induced health disparities
and ensuring that wellness is a collective right, not a social class marker.
Mitigate environmental disasters and their health and wellbeing impacts on
populations by implementing mandatory climate risk assessments across
cities and industrial supply chains.


- Cognitive Sovereignty & Mentally Resilience: The EU must establish cognitive

resilience and equitable care infrastructures to counteract the dual threats of
AI-driven cognitive warfare and a collapsing care system amid a rapidly aging
population.

    - Cognitive Warfare: Policies should regulate neurotech and AI-driven pharma

to prevent monopolisation of cognitive performance, ensuring public control
over neuro-wellness innovation. Investment in public mental wellness hubs,
akin to universal healthcare, will mitigate the post-care culture crisis and rising
mood disorders.

    - Care as the Future of work: With elder care set to become the largest

employment sector, the EU must reframe care labour as skilled,
well-compensated work, integrating AI-enhanced elder care, intergenerational
housing models, and preventative cognitive health into urban and economic
planning.

    - State of Eco-Anxiety, Shorter-attention span & Chronoception Abilities:

Addressing rising eco-anxieties from populations as well as ensuring
cognitive wellbeing to empower psychological wellness amid fear of
uncertainty and faster life paths favouring burn-outs phenomenons and
information overloads. Anticipating the different partnerships between private
and public health, cultural and technological institutions to foster creative and
accessible mental health innovations.


## 2040 Democracy: Civic Awakening

By 2040, Europe has redefined democracy through Civic Tech Governance, pioneering
ethical AI, participatory decision-making, and decentralised digital sovereignty to ensure
democratic resilience in an era of declining liberal institutions. Despite the global erosion of
democratic norms, the EU has positioned itself as a beacon of civic empowerment, where
transparent governance, robust media ecosystems, and future-ready education cultivate an
engaged, critically informed, and digitally sovereign citizenry, reinforcing Europe’s leadership
in ethical governance and inclusive civic participation.

**Levers of resilience:**


  - Ethical Artificial Intelligence Technologies: Becoming the global leader in ethical AI

governance, ensuring AI-driven policy decisions still align with human values.

     - Bioenhancements & Job Employment: The EU must establish regulatory

frameworks that balance innovation in human enhancement with ethical
labour protections, ensuring that cognitive, biological, and AI-augmented
performance does not exacerbate workplace inequalities or erode
fundamental workers' rights.

      - Cyber Sovereignty & Trust Infrastructure: The EU must establish a European

Cyber Defence Initiative that safeguards digital sovereignty, election integrity,
and information ecosystems, ensuring resilient democratic processes through
AI-driven disinformation countermeasures, decentralised verification systems,
and cross-border cyber governance.

      - Decolonised AI Justice: The EU must enforce transparent, bias-free AI

governance by regulating algorithmic discrimination, promoting decolonised
data ethics, and ensuring social media platforms implement robust
protections against digital harassment, fostering an equitable and inclusive
digital ecosystem.


  - Future-ready Education: Empowering current youth for the upcoming European

citizenship.

     - Resilient Pedagogy & Critical Optimism: The EU must embed a new

educational model fostering critical resilience, equipping youth with systemic
thinking, scientific literacy, and solution-driven agency to navigate ecological
and social crises while shaping a desirable Europe for 2040.

     - European Poles of Excellence & Scholar Sovereignty: Establish EU-funded

independent research institutions and cross-disciplinary schools of science,
design, and ethics, safeguarding scientific integrity from global tech
hegemony and external censorship, while positioning Europe as a
cultural-intellectual superpower.

      - Informational Shading & Neutrality: Redesign curricula to cultivate a neutral

but engaged perspective, training the next generation in journalistic, scientific,
and creative methodologies that counter misinformation, foster nuance, and
transform knowledge into democratic tools for societal resilience.


    - Benevolent volunteering: Integrating a communal civic passport for European

citizens to facilitate citizenship engagement and reciprocal support, nurturing
European solidarity development initiatives (from education exchanges to
professional reconversions and cultural synergies).


- Media & Information Resilience: To fortify democratic resilience, the EU must shield

public discourse from authoritarian influence, strengthen independent journalism, and
cultivate a collective European informational identity in the face of disinformation
warfare and media fragmentation.

    - Legislative Firewall Against Foreign Influence: Enact protective laws limiting

foreign lobbying, dark money in media ownership, and disinformation
operations, ensuring EU information sovereignty against external political and
corporate manipulation.

    - Decentralised Media & Cultural News Hubs: Invest in regional cultural

powerhouses and independent journalism networks, creating hyper-local but
interconnected information ecosystems that reinforce European literacy, local
storytelling, and civic engagement.

    - A Collective European Vocabulary for the Information Age: Foster a shared

European knowledge infrastructure, through education, public broadcasting,
and multilingual media initiatives, ensuring citizens can navigate
decentralised information landscapes with clarity, critical thinking, and a
strong cultural foundation.


- Carbon Equity & Inclusive Durability: To prevent carbon tracking from becoming a

tool of social stratification, the EU must ensure decarbonisation policies prioritise
systemic accountability over individual discipline or morality, while fostering equitable
access to durable living.

    - Corporate Responsibility: Strengthen corporate carbon taxation and supply

chain accountability to prevent the shift of net-zero enforcement on to
consumers.

    - Decentralised Carbon governance: Explore publicly owned carbon monitoring

frameworks that empower communities rather than reinforcing top-down
social credit systems, ensuring transparency and democratic oversight.

    - Intersectional Environmentalism: The EU must embed intersectional

environmentalism at the core of its sustainability policies, ensuring that the
interconnections between climate action, social justice and economic
resilience is addressed.

    - Climate Passports & Eco-Citizenship: As heatwaves, water scarcity, and

coastal flooding displace over 50 million people globally, the EU shifts from
crisis response to preemptive climate migration management, prioritising
skilled refugees while fueling ethical debates on exclusionary
humanitarianism.


- Post-Nation-State Models: EU should experiment with Decentralised Civic Networks,

giving citizens direct power over local policies.
