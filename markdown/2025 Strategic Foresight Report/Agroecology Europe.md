**Agroecology Europe’s contribution to Strategic Foresights**

Agroecology Europe (AEEU) would like to thank the European Commission for having
invited stakeholders to contribute to this **[public consultation on Strategic Foresights](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14535-2025-Strategic-Foresight-Report_en)** .

The following contribution aims at providing relevant published (and pre-published) scientific
research, analyses and data, especially documents that synthesise the current state of
knowledge in the relevant fields, including available foresight studies and evidence-based
input to help EU policymakers create pathways towards preferable long-term futures by
proposing actionable policy recommendations, while addressing the actual questions asked
in this public consultation.

**Scope: what are the main challenges to long-term EU resilience and what are the**
**strengths on which Europe can build it?**
The motto of the long-term EU resilience forecast must be to follow the native American
proverb that says: _We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our_
_children_ .

**The challenges to long-term EU resilience**
It is crucial that the European Commission, when setting scenarios on possible futures, gives
full recognition to the enormous risks of environmental and climate tipping points, ranging
them at the same level - if not more important - than risk on geopolitical challenges.
Moreover, such environmental and climate tipping points can be expected to trigger social
negative impacts, with high risk of instability and strong societal disturbances at regional,
national, and European levels [1] .

AEEU welcomes the reference in the public consultation saying _‘For the EU, resilience_
_means anticipating disruptions, absorbing them, and transforming in response to them -_
_without compromising long-term goals and priorities. And doing all this in a sustainable, fair_
_and democratic manner.’_ Also, AEEU welcomes the fact that ‘ _The 2025 Strategic Foresight_
_Report seeks to enhance coherence and synergies between policies that are relevant to_
_strengthening long-term resilience._ ’

Furthermore, AEEU recognises the challenge in the geopolitical situation and the importance
of developing a _‘comprehensive framework for long-term resilience across policy priorities_
_such as leveraging Europe’s global power, sustainable prosperity and competitiveness,_
_sustaining our quality of life and protecting democracy_ ’.

_Tipping Points_ [. Bonn: Author: UNU_Tipping-Points_231017_no-watermark.pdf](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/interconnectedrisks/reports/2023/UNU_Tipping-Points_231017_no-watermark.pdf)


**AEEU encourages the European Commission to expand the scope of the strategic**
**foresights to:**

**●​ Give at least equal recognition to the risk of tipping points and planetary**

**boundaries, when setting up scenarios in the strategic foresights, and**
**●​ Look into the potential of the agricultural sector when developing**

**transformative pathways towards avoiding soil degradation, biodiversity loss,**
**and climate change impacts, recognising that the current agricultural sector is**
**part of the problem, but it can also be part of the solution** **[2]** **.**

Here, AEEU would like to cite a series of examples of key studies on environmental and
climate, and on tipping points that the EU needs to consider:


●​ The last IPCC report (Summary for policymakers) [3]
●​ The Global Tipping Points report of 2023 [4]
●​ Tipping points in the biosphere [5]
●​ Warning of a forthcoming collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation [6]

As the IPCC report demonstrates, agriculture is one of the sectors which is most impacted
by climate change. By impacting agriculture (but also water availability), climate change has
a negative impact on food security [7] . The risk of the deterioration of food security in Europe
should be taken into consideration in any European foresight [8] .

Also, it is then important that the European Commission **recognises as ‘drivers of change’**
**the crucial importance of developing assumptions** (scenarios/possible futures/drivers of
change) on how to respect planetary boundaries and avoid/deal with tipping points
(i.e.collapses of ecosystems, melting of arctic ice, permanent adverse weather patterns (e.g.
extreme rainfall events and flooding, prolonged droughts, heat waves, forest fire waves)).

**Agroecology Europe calls on the European Commission to recognize agroecology as**
**a promising and key solution for the future of the EU food system as many studies**
**demonstrate that agroecology and related practices are approaches that manage to**
**adapt and mitigate climate change in agricultur** e [9,10,11,12] .

Moreover, there are foresight models that present what an EU Agroecological food system
could look like and what are the possible paths to transition towards such an agroecological
system:

Concretely, **AEEU proposes that the European Commission adds the following inputs**
**into EUs strategic reflections when developing agricultural transition pathways:**

●​ Agroecological and other innovative approaches, and transition pathways [20,21]
●​ Governance networks for agroecology transitions in rural Europe [22]
●​ Wallon government initiative promoting agroecology, called TerraE [23]

**The strengths on which Europe can build its resilience**
This public consultation recalled that the EU should ‘ _enhance coherence and synergies_
_between policies that are relevant to strengthening long-term resilience_ ’.

The most appropriate way forward is moving towards full implementation of the EU Green
Deal, and as part of that, continue to develop and implement its policies enhancing long-term
resilience, keeping soil healthy, combating climate change and biodiversity degradation **.**

Plus, the EU should ensure policy coherence, and not simplify but strengthen the green
architecture of the Common Agricultural. While efficiency in policies and regulations is
important, it cannot be used as a mechanism to deteriorate commitments to biodiversity
restoration, climate change mitigation and adaptation, economic fairness, … That would put
in jeopardy the future capacity of the EU to cope with future challenges (climate change
impacts, geostrategic tensions, …).

Europe’s strength is the EU Green Deal. The scenario setting of the Strategic Foresight
needs to take into account the potential of COP negotiations.

It is fundamental that resilient societies and fairness are being created not only in Europe but
globally. The EU should build on the fact that 197 countries including the European
Commission and a number of its member states signed up to the 10 elements of
agroecology of FAO in 2019 [24] . In October 2024, environmental ministers called on the 13
principles of agroecology to be integrated into the COP on soil desertification [25] .

The conclusion of this specific COP expresses that it is necessary to “(...) _continue_
_developing, defining and promoting the use of sustainable land and water management_
_practices and approaches with high potential for combined environmental and_
_socio-economic gains, such as nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches,_
_schemes for payment for ecosystem services, agroecology, agroforestry and other_
_sustainable agricultural practices,_ _and to collaborate on projects that contribute to the_
_achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals relevant to the United Nations_
_Convention to Combat Desertification_ [28] ”. In that sense, as the EU has been leading and is
engaged in advancing these commitments, it could take the lead in opening up an honest and
participative dialogue in parallel at the three COPs of the Climate change, Biodiversity, and
Desertification Conventions around how to face a fair transition of agriculture without harm for
all people, territories and political stability.

**Imagine 2040: How would you characterise a resilient EU in 2040?**
The way forward developing transition pathways through increased uptake of agroecology.

An agroecological world in 2040 could look like:

●​ Diversified farming is promoted by policies. The role of biodiversity in providing

benefits for farming and for the whole society is recognized and highly valued.
Consumers are aware of the importance of a short supply chain for the sustainability
(social, economic, and environmental) of farming systems, consequently the demand
for local products is high.

●​ The territorial approach is promoted by policies where local markets and short supply

chains are highly developed. Local communities are engaged around local supply
chains and territorial diversities are economically and socially valorised. Young
farmers are replacing aging farmers and are encouraged to start a new farm thanks
to policy support. Access to land is easier and secured for new farmer.

●​ There is an increase in the number of farming cooperatives and farm innovation

networks that enable farmers to share resources (e.g. equipment/labour), and
combine their learning to keep innovating both in terms of production and marketing.

●​ Healthy food policies are strong and consumers are encouraged to demand

high-quality food instead of cheap and high-calories food. Farmers diversify their
production to meet the high demand of local and high-quality products. Diversity of
crops and cultivars is exploited because of the higher nutritional quality and
adaptability to local environments. Farmers are paid a fair and decent price for their
production.

●​ Thanks to the higher adaptability of a high-biodiversity system, it is not necessary to

rely on chemicals to maintain productivity. Diversified crop rotations, increasing
crop/livestock systems, and the maintenance of semi-natural habitats that host
beneficial insects help increase biodiversity that, in turn, helps keep pests and

diseases under control. Farms have adopted practices to increase on-farm recycling
of nutrients and energy . The transition towards agroecology has reduced the
dependence on fossil fuels and chemical inputs of the EU food system (by applying
practices that rely much less on chemical inputs to produce and valorise best natural
resources and ecosystem services), which consequently has increased EU
resilience, sovereignty, and independence vis-a-vis other countries [29] .

●​ Farms are resilient face to climate change impacts due to the implementation of

agroecological practices.

In addition, beyond facilitating the uptake of sustainable and healthy diets, EU resilient food
systems should seriously tackle the issue of drastically reducing food waste from the
alarming present global level of 30% [30], which is unethical besides being environmentally and
socio-economically unsustainable. This issue is another key pillar of the agroecological
approach.

**Society and generations: How can we ensure a resilient society and fairness between**
**generations?**

**The EU should better engage with civil society organisations and citizens when**
**developing such strategic forecast reports. The EU should reinforce democracy**
**within the Union and in the Member-States.**

An important step in developing a resilient society and fairness between generations is to
ensure that these strategic forecast reports are not only limited to _‘discussions with other EU_
_Institutions via the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System_ ’. AEEU welcomes this
public consultation, but looking at the limited number of respondents it is crucial to find other
ways to ensure full inclusion of reflections from civil society organisations.

Nowadays European democracy is shaken by interests that want to limit it or even destroy
it [31], but for the sake of good livelihoods for European citizens, prosperity, and fairness, it is
paramount that the EU commits to reinforce democracy in the EU. Democracy is not limited
to voting. Citizens must be informed with science-based facts and reality, and the Rule of
Law should be upheld in every EU Member-State and civil society organisations should be
sufficiently supported in the Multiannual Financial Framework [32] .

**Long-term resilience: Which critical policy actions should be initiated today to**
**strengthen resilience in the EU by 2040?**

**The EU should identify transition pathways within the approach of the European**
**Union being “** _**United in Diversity**_ **” (an EU slogan from a few decades ago) with**
**attention focused on uptake of agroecology in a territorial and/or regional approach.**

**The EU should consider transforming the CAP so that it becomes the Common**
**Agroecology Policy, embracing agroecology as the main paradigm of the future EU**
**Food System** .

Finally, while the idea of social tipping points [33] is important as part of the strategic reflections
on transition pathway actions that need to be accompanied by the European Commission
developing and implementing EU environmental, climate and agricultural laws, it cannot rely
on citizens willingness to engage all alone.

**Synergies and tensions: What crucial synergies and tensions can be identified across**
**various EU priorities which might, respectively, help or hamper EU’s long-term**
**resilience? How can we enhance these synergies and mitigate these tensions?**

Developing a resilient, agroecological and sustainable EU food system could create tensions
with other EU priorities (such as the development of new Free Trade Agreements that
integrate agriculture). As the EU food system has impacts on various policy fields
(agriculture, trade and economy, health, environment, …), its transformation towards a
resilient food system for 2040, based on agroecology demands that the different involved
DGs work together and strengthen their collaboration, to limit the tensions. Political choices
are made in coherence with the global objective of ‘agroecologizing’ the EU food system.

**Enhancing strategic foresight: How could the European Commission further improve**
**its approach to strategic foresight to increase its impact on designing EU policies for**
