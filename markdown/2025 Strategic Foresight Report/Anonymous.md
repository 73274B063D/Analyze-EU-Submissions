feedback: 'Some of the main challenges to EU resilience are as follows: ageing populations,
  insecure borders, climate change, external threats from countries such as Russia,
  and so on. A resilient EU is characterized by having a solid, but firm stance on
  a variety of global issues. The EU should start off by understanding key issues
  and working around those issues.'

llm_agreements: Both submissions identify climate change and external geopolitical
  threats as important challenges to EU resilience and call for the Union to take
  action to strengthen its capacity to respond. They also share a general emphasis
  on the need to understand key problems before designing responses (i.e., a diagnostic
  step or strategic orientation).
llm_disagreements: 'Submission A prioritises detailed, governance‑led responses: strengthening
  democratic safeguards, regulatory enforcement, strategic foresight, and governance
  of emerging technologies (AI, biotech, SRM), as well as intergenerational equity,
  mental health, procurement reform and biosecurity. Submission B focuses on traditional
  security issues (borders, ageing populations) and a ''firm'' external stance, offering
  little detail on technology governance, foresight, or the nuanced climate intervention
  and research approaches emphasised in Submission A.'
