feedback: 'Four challenges: 1. "Data as Capital" The forerunners of techno-feudalism
  GAFA-M are setting the standard for valuing data. Soon, the worth of data and the
  speed at which it is exchanged will surpass the gold standard and the analog era
  of capitalism. A failure to recognize the value of (personal) data from knowing
  someone''s favorite beverage to the exact time they enter their car or get on a
  train, to the production capacity of an industry "competitor" is already generating
  massive profits for these digital empires. There is little public awareness of the
  consequences of this data mining, even as these companies construct "The Sims"-like
  digital twins of pretty much "everything". This is the tip of the iceberg as we
  fail to assess the impact of Google, Facebook, and TikTok in shaping collective
  behavior. Today, we see influencers subtly encroaching on personal space; tomorrow,
  we may witness hyper-targeted advertising that exploits biological signals such
  as a smartwatch detecting low blood sugar and triggering a perfectly timed beverage
  advertisement. From predicting to outright shaping the stock market or a political
  election, with growing room for speculation and other deviations... The collaboration
  of major corporations like in designing subliminal behavioral manipulation threatens
  autonomy across all levels (see Yuval Harari "Homo Deus" and other works). Worse,
  part of this data infrastructure used to extract and exploit information for profit
  is built with taxpayer money, offering no tangible health/wealth return to society
  (Citizens are "doubly" taxed for free profit of these companies). 2. Energy Consumption
  The exponential growth of data/digital comes with a corresponding surge in energy
  demand. Sustaining this data-driven world requires exponential energy resources,
  further straining existing infrastructure and accelerating environmental degradation
  (again, taxpayer money, no return) 3. "Carbon as Capital" failure & Adaptation:
  Two critical realizations will have to be translated into better policies a) EU
  Initiatives to "decarbonize" Europe are insufficient to meet the energy demands
  of a future highly technological society. b) While reducing carbon emissions remains
  the most accessible way to mitigate human impact on the biosphere, the relationship
  between emissions reduction and climate stabilization is not immediate or linear.
  Like a pot of simmering water, turning off the heat does not stop the boiling instantaneously.
  Reversing centuries of industrial impact within a single century is unrealistic.
  Instead, the focus might shift toward accelerating climate-resilient technologies
  and improving adaptive (techno/social) responses/strategies. 4. Mastering the Massive
  Migration Trends: In the short term, worsening living conditions driven by rising
  heat, water scarcity, and declining food production will force large-scale migration
  from regions surrounding the Mediterranean. The current strategy of postponing meaningful
  solutions will soon reach its breaking point. Resilience - EU Policy 1. Flexible:
  The European Union must adopt increasingly flexible policies to navigate these challenges
  faster and more effectively. 2. Scientific/technical: As the direct effects of climate
  change accumulate, and the indirect ones in the global south spill over, international
  collaboration may have to give way to more stringent "scientific" needs and policies.
  See success stories like CFCs, Covid-vaccine, etc. 3. AI-Driven: Artificial intelligence
  should play a role in shaping policy and governance. However, the root cause of
  today''s crisis lies in political elites consistently siding with wealth owners
  for short-term gains. If European democracy & society do not become the genuine
  focus of decision-making potentially guided by AI then the 21st century risks becoming
  a technological "Middle Age". 4. Focused: resource scarcity may result in further
  pooling of policy targets, like developing a stable, scalable fusion process.'

llm_agreements: Both submissions identify concentrated private tech power and data
  extraction as major systemic risks and call for stronger EU action to counterbalance
  that influence. They also converge on the centrality of advanced technologies (notably
  AI) to future resilience and the need for proactive, science-informed EU policy
  and investment — including preparing for climate-driven migration and the insufficiency
  of mitigation alone.
llm_disagreements: 'One submission places stronger emphasis on democratic safeguards,
  public oversight, precautionary governance, intergenerational fairness, and sector-specific
  measures (biosecurity, mental health, SRM research governance), while the other
  prioritises rapid, technocratic, AI-driven decision-making, flexible policy trade-offs,
  and concentrated technological programs (e.g., pooling resources toward major tech
  goals). They also differ in tone on research/ deployment risk: one stresses inclusive
  deliberation and regulatory enforcement, the other stresses speed, scientific prioritisation
  and resource-focused responses to meet urgent technical and energy challenges.'
