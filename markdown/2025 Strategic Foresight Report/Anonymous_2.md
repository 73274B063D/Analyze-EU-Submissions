feedback: I my opinion there should be more availability to birth control for women,
  including free access to period products. There are already some accessible, but
  there should be more available options because everyone is different and has different
  reasons for using these products. Also food prices are sky high there should be
  no reason for a person to need to take out a loan just to be able to afford a living.

llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise social fairness and improving access to
  essential health and welfare services, and they share concern about the affordability
  pressures households face. Each supports policies that would reduce burdens on vulnerable
  groups and increase equitable access to basic needs and healthcare-related products.
llm_disagreements: 'They differ in scale and emphasis: one submission focuses on immediate,
  concrete social support (free period products, birth control access, affordable
  food), while the other emphasises long-term strategic measures, institutional reforms,
  and technological and security resilience. They also prefer different policy instruments
  — direct provision and affordability measures versus systemic investment, regulatory
  restructuring, and strategic foresight.'
