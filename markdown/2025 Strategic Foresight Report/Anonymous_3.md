llm_agreements: Both submissions identify threats to democracy and liberal values
  in Europe and call for urgent, well‑resourced EU action to defend them. They converge
  on the need for strategic efforts that include strengthening societal resilience
  through education and civic capacity‑building (including digital literacy).
llm_disagreements: The other submission is narrowly focused on an education‑centred
  response as the primary remedy, while the other takes a much broader approach that
  prioritises regulatory enforcement, institutional reform, strategic investment in
  technology and research, procurement and defence/industrial measures, and climate/biosecurity
  preparedness. In short, they agree on the problem and the need for resourcing, but
  differ on scope and the mix of policy instruments to prioritise.
