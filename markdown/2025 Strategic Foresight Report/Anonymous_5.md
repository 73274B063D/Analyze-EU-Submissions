feedback: The EU is lacking the ability, or has not shown its ability, to project
  the military power that is sometimes needed to shape it's internal, but mos importantly
  external policies. We have seen news of countries in the course of destabilizing
  which then led to massive waves of immigration. The EU just watched everything happen
  and all it did was close it's borders a bit tighter and argue who should deal with
  the refugees. A more pro-active approach would have been to intervene militarily,
  or otherwise, at the source and stabilize the countries(s) where refugees were originating
  from. Going a step further, we see the potential of space technologies, like, for
  instance, the American owned Starlink. In this field the EU is again not making
  its presence felt and it feels like it watching from the benches what will happen.
  I think that we need to take a pro-active attitude in this field as well. ESA's
  proposition from a few years ago for a space-based solar power generation plant
  is such an example.

llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise stronger EU strategic autonomy—notably
  in defence capability and critical technologies—and call for the bloc to be more
  proactive internationally rather than passively observing crises. They also share
  concern about dependence on non-EU actors in areas like space and critical infrastructure
  and support building European capacity and procurement mechanisms to reduce that
  reliance.
llm_disagreements: The other submission advocates direct, interventionist military
  action to stabilise source countries and a more immediate assertive posture in space,
  whereas the first submission emphasises strengthening defence industrial capacity
  alongside robust democratic oversight, multilateral governance and long-term institution-building.
  The first submission places substantial weight on regulatory frameworks, social
  resilience (mental health, intergenerational equity), research-led approaches and
  precaution (e.g., SRM governance and biosecurity), priorities that are absent from
  the other submission’s narrow focus on force projection and space presence.
