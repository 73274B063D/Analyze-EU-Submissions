feedback: I would love to have more webunars, where we can attend from anywhere around
  world. Since there are people that are shy but they have something to say they have
  a chance to do that where anybody cant see them until they build confidence.

llm_agreements: 'Both submissions value more inclusive and accessible public participation:
  they support lowering barriers so a wider range of people (including shy or marginalised
  voices) can engage. Each endorses remote or low-friction participation mechanisms
  and capacity-building to broaden stakeholder input into discussions and decision-making.'
llm_disagreements: 'One submission is narrowly focused on practical, grassroots measures
  (more webinars and anonymity-friendly formats) to increase participation, while
  the other prioritises systemic policy, institutional reforms, technical governance,
  and large-scale research investments across multiple sectors. They therefore differ
  sharply in scope, scale, and policy priorities: one emphasizes immediate, low-cost
  engagement tools; the other emphasizes structural regulatory, research and enforcement
  actions that the short submission does not address.'
