llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise strengthening European defence and improving
  fiscal resilience as part of broader stability efforts. Each treats increased resources
  for security as a legitimate lever to address budgetary and geopolitical vulnerabilities.
llm_disagreements: 'They differ sharply on who should pay and how funds should be
  mobilised: one calls for a municipal/city-level levy of 5–6%, while the other advocates
  EU-level instruments (procurement reform, public–private R&D investment, using pension
  funds) and stronger central governance with democratic safeguards. The municipal-contribution
  prescription raises concerns about local fiscal burden, accountability, and distributive
  fairness that are not addressed by the flat levy proposal.'
