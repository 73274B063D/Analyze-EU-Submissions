llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise citizen welfare, social solidarity, and
  protection of people from harm, emphasising wellbeing and reducing poverty as key
  goals. They also share a common opposition to unnecessary wars and a stated desire
  to enhance the protection of citizens.
llm_disagreements: 'They diverge sharply on environmental and public‑health priorities:
  Submission B calls for ''less green'' policies and fewer vaccines, whereas Submission
  A emphasises robust climate action, preparedness (including research on interventions)
  and strengthening biosecurity and vaccine/biomanufacturing capacity. Submission
  A also emphasises stronger regulatory frameworks, enforcement, and proactive technology
  governance and strategic foresight, which contrasts with Submission B’s emphasis
  on individual freedom and reduced regulatory emphasis on ‘green’ agendas.'
