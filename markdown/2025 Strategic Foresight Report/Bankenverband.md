 - **Scope: what are the main challenges to long-term EU resilience and what are**
**the strengths on which Europe can build it?**


The long-term resilience of the European Union (EU) depends on its ability to adapt to

economic, geopolitical, technological, and environmental challenges while leveraging its
institutional, economic, and social strengths. The long-term resilience of the EU currently
faces several challenges.
Firstly, geopolitical tensions and economic rivalries disrupt supply chains.  High
dependencies on natural and technological resources pose an economic risk, particularly
with regard to the innovative strength of the European economy.
Secondly, the change in the global political situation is not perceived the same way
throughout the European society. Such divergences can be dangerous for setting necessary
political priorities for the protection of the EU’s digital sector.
Thirdly, technological advancements such as AI and blockchain bring efficiency but
simultaneously pose security risks and regulatory challenges. The dependence of Europe
on external partners for key technologies are a key challenge. The adaptability of European

companies is lower than in other regions of the world. The reasons for this include Europe's
enormous heterogeneity, fragmentation, lack of standards and, in some cases, cultural

peculiarities.
Furthermore, the EU continues to face a significant challenge of fragmentation of its
internal market. Addressing this structural inconsistency is crucial for fostering a more
competitive and unified European economy. Enabling economies of scale is one of the key
success factors in digital economies.
Finally, the shift to a sustainable and digital economy requires significant investments, with
digital finance playing a key role. Despite these challenges, the European Union is built
upon solid foundations. Its robust financial sector supports innovation. There is a strong

emphasis on education to foster research and development, providing a solid base for
growth and innovation. This is demonstrated by public-private partnerships, such as the
'Tokenise Europe 2025' initiative, which fosters rapid innovation while also addressing
regulatory gaps.


 - **Imagine 2040: How would you characterise a resilient EU in 2040?**


In 2040, a resilient EU should be characterized by a robust digital finance ecosystem, high
independencies of infrastructure of non-EU partners, and geopolitical autonomy.
The digital finance sector would harness the power of AI, blockchain, digital assets, and
central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), complimented by independent cloud infrastructure
and competitive data frameworks, as well as efficient electronic identities for individuals,

businesses and machines (e.g. sensor IDs).
Finally, geopolitical autonomy would be built upon strong digital capabilities, reducing
reliance on external technologies and diversified trade partnerships.

- **Society and generations: How can we ensure a resilient society and fairness**
**between generations?**


To ensure a resilient society and intergenerational fairness, financial education initiatives
should be expanded. Such efforts would prepare younger generations for making sound
financial decisions, providing essential knowledge in financial planning and retirement
savings. Independently, a strong pension and investment union with a significant


Seite 2 / 4


proportion of equity-based savings by European citizen, could enable long-term wealth
creation across the society and support the financing of innovations.

- **Long-term resilience: Which critical policy actions should be initiated today**
**to strengthen resilience in the EU by 2040?**


To strengthen the EU’s long-term resilience by 2040, several critical policy measures
should be implemented in the near future.
First and foremost, enhancing cybersecurity is essential. The implementation of EU-wide
cybersecurity initiatives, such as the Cyber Solidarity Act, would ensure the protection and
resilience of the EU including the digital financial systems.
Secondly, public-private partnerships (PPPs) should be actively promoted. This includes
expanding financial education initiatives and supporting FinTech startups to drive
innovation.
Thirdly, fostering digital and green finance is crucial. Seamlessly integrating blockchain
and digital financial technologies and leveraging these for the green transition would not

only support sustainable investments but also enhance transparency.
Finally, regulatory frameworks and technological standards should be harmonized.


- **Synergies and tensions: What crucial synergies and tensions can be identified**
**across various EU priorities which might, respectively, help or hamper EU’s**
**long-term resilience? How can we enhance these synergies and mitigate**
**these tensions?**


The digitalization of the European economy can create significant benefits, especially when
synergies from common standards, rules, and a unified regulatory framework are created.
While public-private partnerships (PPPs) play a key role by leveraging strategic foresight

initiatives to align EU policies with market needs, standardizing regulatory frameworks and
technological standards are also crucial.

However, certain tensions must be addressed. Economies of scale for few large technology
providers create benefits in terms of cost, accessibility and reach for their customers. At
the same time, fragmented EU markets create barriers for smaller providers to turn into
actual competitors. The combination of those factors creates lock-in effects that are difficult

to overcome. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between regulation and innovation:
overregulation can hinder progress in digital finance, while insufficient regulation can
hamper market adoption or even lead to instability.
A potential solution is European digital standards to be promoted and acknowledged by
European regulatory framework in order to create an environment for innovation while
ensuring market fairness.


 - **Enhancing strategic foresight: How could the European Commission further**
**improve its approach to strategic foresight to increase its impact on designing**
**EU policies for a desirable future?**


To enhance the European Commission’s strategic foresight approach and amplify its impact
on shaping EU policies for a desirable future, several measures can be taken.
An enhanced EU communication strategy could ensure wider distribution of knowledge
about the strategic foresight approach.


Seite 3 / 4


The use of AI-driven foresight tools could enhance data-driven decision-making by
anticipating financial and geopolitical risks.
Strengthening collaboration between the EU, banks, FinTechs, and academia would expand
greater stakeholder cooperation and create synergies.
Additionally, promoting scenario planning for specific industries, by incorporating longterm simulations, could better prepare stakeholders for emerging financial and geopolitical
challenges.

**1** **Strategic Foresight Key Challenges of European Commission and its**
**impact on digital economy**


**1.1** **Contribution**


Since 2020 the European Commission has published four Strategic Foresight Reports. These
reports identified six megatrends, which are crucial for the EU and its monetary area to address
over the next decade. This paper will focus on three of these key challenges, illustrating how
they are not only critical for the EU but also present significant challenges for banks and, by

extension, the broader economy. In the second part of the paper, it will be demonstrated that
digital finance offers a potential solution, bridging the challenges identified by the European
Commission with those faced by banks and the wider economic landscape.


**1.2** **What is Strategic Foresight and how is it leveraged by the European**
**Commission?**


The discipline of Strategic Foresight plays a pivotal role in shaping the future by examining and
anticipating developments. Unlike forecasting, it focuses on exploring diverse potential futures,
along with their accompanying opportunities and challenges. The European Commission views
strategic foresight as an essential tool for anticipating and addressing future challenges facing the

European Union **.** **[1]** By employing foresight methodologies, the Commission aims to identify
emerging trends, opportunities, and risks to inform policymaking and enhance the EU's resilience
and competitiveness. This approach involves systematic analysis, scenario planning, and
stakeholder engagement to develop forward-looking strategies that promote sustainable growth,
innovation, and social cohesion across the EU member states. Recognizing the interconnected
nature of global issues, the Commission's commitment to strategic foresight underscores its role

as a proactive and forward-thinking institution in shaping the future of Europe.

Central to the above-mentioned approach is the annual publication of the Strategic Foresight
Report **[2]** by the European Commission, which is also a direct source for its Work Programs **[3]** .
Methodologies such as horizon scanning, megatrends analysis, scenario planning, and visioning
are employed to facilitate this process. Additionally, the EU-wide Foresight Network **[4]** serves as a
collaborative platform, uniting intelligence and foresight expertise from all Member States and the
European Commission for strategic discussions on future-oriented issues. Through these
interconnected efforts, Strategic Foresight actively contributes to informed decision-making and
proactive planning within the EU.

Seite 4 / 13


**1.3** **Identified Key challenges with impact on digital economy**


**Challenge 1: The rise of geopolitics and the reshaping of globalization.**

The global landscape is shifting, marked by rising geopolitical tensions and economic competition.
Nations are integrating domestic and foreign policies, focusing on technological advancement and
economic partnerships. Emerging economies seek greater influence, complicating international
cooperation on transnational issues like climate change. The EU promotes initiatives such as the
'Global Gateway' to support various countries that are under the influence of disinformation in the
growing competition with other narratives.

As globalization strains, challenges such as the pandemic and economic rivalries disrupt supply
chains and trade, affecting key EU sectors. These disruptions highlight the need for resilient supply
chains, raising environmental and economic concerns. Upholding multilateralism and reforming
institutions like the WTO become increasingly critical in this context.


Geopolitical shifts also impact the digital economy and banking, leading to regulatory scrutiny and
potential restrictions on cross-border financial transactions. These geopolitical changes may
disrupt digital infrastructure of banks and prompt currency fluctuations, impacting the stability of
digital financial services. Ensuring the security and stability of the banking sector remains vital, as
it is crucial to Europe’s economic resilience.


The rise of dependency on external resources and technologies has emerged as a critical concern,
as it compromises autonomy and long-term competitiveness. Protectionism and trade barriers
further fragment markets, driving up costs and limiting innovation. This shift challenges global
financial systems, especially in areas like sanctions and regulatory complexity, increasing
administrative costs for banks and financial institutions.

Amid these developments, central banks are accelerating efforts in digital currencies, with the
potential emergence of a digital euro raising questions about the role of banks in offering
cryptocurrency platforms. Geopolitical tensions and policy shifts add uncertainty, forcing
businesses to adapt through new partnerships, regulatory frameworks, and strategic agility.

The evolving landscape, marked by shifts in global trade relationships, underscores the need for
strategic foresight and collaboration. To remain competitive, Europe must develop a robust
blockchain infrastructure and adapt its financial systems to meet the demands of an interconnected
and rapidly changing global environment.

**Challenge 2: Technological transformation**

Technological transformation refers to the integration of new technologies into organizations,
industries, or societies, reshaping processes, products, and services. Key components include:


Seite 5 / 13


 Digitization: Converting analogue processes into digital formats for greater efficiency.
 Automation: Streamlining tasks through technology to boost productivity and accuracy.
 Innovation: Creating new products, services, or business models using advanced

technologies.
 Cultural Change: Shifting corporate mindsets to embrace technological advancements.
 Tech Integration: Incorporating AI, IoT, blockchain, and cloud computing to enhance systems.

In the financial system, this transformation has spurred innovations like mobile payments,
simplifying transactions, improving security, and increasing global transaction volumes. Digital

identification has expanded financial inclusion, and the use of big data has optimized risk
management, aiding financial stability. Open Banking fosters further innovation by linking

financial intermediaries.

However, challenges remain. Many systems still rely on outdated processes, especially in crossborder transactions, where some parts of the world lag in digital transformation. Emerging
technologies like AI, digital currencies, and enhanced financial interconnectivity, termed the
“Finternet,” will likely streamline market interactions, though their full impact is still uncertain.

Banks play a central role in this transformation, both driving and responding to it. Yet, this raises
concerns about market stability as new players like FinTechs and InsurTechs enter. Regulation is
key to ensuring trust and stability, as banks, unlike many new entrants, are held to stricter
standards. Weakening banks could harm economic resilience.

The growing labor shortage highlights technology's importance as a strategic resource, replacing
human resources to maintain competitiveness. However, as banks become more interconnected,
they face increased cyberattacks, with significant economic losses and potential trust issues.
Maintaining digital security is critical to safeguarding the financial system.

**Challenge 3: Ensure sufficient private and public funding for sustainability.**


"Sustainability transformation" refers to the shift in the economy, society, and politics toward

sustainable development. It aims to create systems that are ecologically, economically, and
socially viable long-term. This involves reducing environmental harm, promoting social justice, and
fostering resource-efficient economic growth. Key areas affected include energy, agriculture,
mobility, industry, and urban development, with the goal of operating within planetary boundaries
to preserve a liveable environment for future generations. Achieving this requires technological
innovation, societal change, and political regulations that encourage sustainable actions.


Climate change is projected to lower global GDP by 37% by 2100, with Germany already
experiencing €145 billion in damages from extreme weather between 2000 and 2021. To combat
this, the EU Green Deal aims to invest one trillion euros by 2030, requiring close cooperation


Seite 6 / 13


between business, politics, and finance. With European corporate financing largely dependent on
loans, banks play a key role in driving sustainability efforts.

Digital technologies are crucial for this transformation. Blockchain, for example, enhances

transparency by linking ESG data to products and supply chains, enabling more targeted financing
for climate goals. IoT applications, such as smart energy and waste management, also support
sustainability by improving efficiency. Banks are vital partners in this ecosystem, offering expertise
in identity management, transaction processing, and account management.

The involvement of banks and digital finance tools is essential for reducing long-term costs and

driving the transition to a more sustainable economy, benefiting businesses, banks, and society
as a whole.

**2** **Strategies for Advancing Digital Finance Integration**


The previous section demonstrated that the support of banks in the area of Digital Finance, as well

as measures to aid in the use and acceptance of digital financial instruments, can address the key
challenges identified by the Commission. This section will give some examples how and with what
measures banks in the Digital Finance sector can be effectively supported, and what is necessary
for these to be applied in society. The specific measures to strengthen the Digital Finance sector
involves a multifaceted approach centered on four core strategic elements: Awareness,
Understanding, Adapting and Protecting. It becomes evident that by considering these four pillars,

favorable conditions for the implementation of digital financial instruments can be created,
resulting in significant benefits in terms of resilience, growth, and development for the European

economy.


**2.1** **Raising awareness through broad education and communication**


Raising the awareness for the Digital Finance topics requires more than just technological
advancements; it needs a comprehensive approach based on three pillars: education, mindset,
and transparent information. Effective communication is essential for fostering trust and
encouraging participation. It's important to understand why some customers are hesitant about
Digital Finance, often due to concerns about transparency and data security. We belief, that a lot
of those concerns could be mitigated by effective communication and awareness. This however
can hardly be done by the industry alone. Therefore, a Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)
approach would be advisable to generally improve the digital financial literacy of EU citizens.

Building a positive attitude towards Digital Finance is vital. This involves instilling confidence,
encouraging individual financial responsibility, and promoting entrepreneurial actions within the
European Union. A skilled workforce with financial literacy and technological understanding is
crucial. General financial literacy, including knowledge of the role of banks, is the foundation,
empowering individuals to make informed financial decisions. The financial education efforts of
the Association of German Banks are one example in this direction. A whole dedicated team is
working on different educational offers for different target audiences, which are offered in
schools with accompanying materials for teachers, online, like the influencer account
“Finanzfritzen”, or as part of the broad, yearly initiative “Schulbanker”. This banking simulation
game is aimed at students in high schools throughout the German-speaking region, allowing
them to run their own banks. The main goal is to include as many participants as possible from
all types of schools.


**2.2** **Promoting an Understanding of Digital Finance**


Understanding the background and strategic vision of all stakeholders is essential for fostering an
appreciation of Digital Finance's role in international relations. In the following paragraphs, a few


Seite 8 / 13


selected initiatives are introduced, that showcase how digital finance can be promoted within the
EU and beyond in a holistic approach.

For instance, initiatives like the “Transatlantic Business Initiative” (TBI) are actively promoting

core components in supporting Digital Finance issues. TBI has already dedicated an entire
workstream to the cross-border promotion of Digital Finance. By facilitating partnerships and
advocating for regulatory coherence, TBI seeks to strengthen transatlantic economic cooperation
and enhance the competitiveness of businesses in the global market. Additionally, TBI supports
transatlantic cooperation by helping stakeholders understand what is relevant, such as how the
relevance of standards emerges. The initiative could be expanded by the accession of other

European market participants.


A prime example of bridging the gap between regulatory authorities, overseers and innovators in
the market is the European Forum for Innovation Facilitators (EFIF). It plays a crucial role in
promoting digital finance within the EU by fostering collaboration among key regulators, including
the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA),
and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). By bringing together
these financial authorities with innovative market initiatives and their members, the EFIF creates
a supportive regulatory environment that accelerates the development and adoption of new
financial technologies. Regulators involved in the EFIF share best practices, harmonize approaches,
and address cross-border challenges, ensuring a cohesive and efficient framework for digital
finance. Through initiatives like regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs, these regulators enable
the digital finance sector to test innovative solutions safely. This harmonized approach in the end
also boosts the EU’s competitive edge globally.

Another example of promoting Digital Finance through improved understanding is the initiative
“Tokenise Europe 2025.” Founded by the European Commission and Association of German Banks
(Bankenverband) in collaboration with over 20 European financial service providers, industrial
companies, startups, and associations, Tokenise Europe 2025 serves as a key Digital Finance
initiative. The initiative underscores the benefits of tokenization and its critical role in enhancing

the competitiveness of the European economy. By bringing together decision-makers from diverse
sectors with key industry experts, Tokenise Europe 2025 emphasizes an educational approach,

fostering understanding and collaboration among participants.


**2.3** **Adapting Digital Finance in the European economic network**


In the area of Adapting, the focus lies on fostering networking effects among European companies
and an environment conducive to mutual investment. This entails the establishment of incentive
structures, along with the strategic utilization of shared resources and infrastructure that can be
seamlessly scaled.


Seite 9 / 13


Externally, the brand “Made in Europe” embodies values of security, stability, and quality,
presenting a unified image concept that resonates with stakeholders. By cultivating these shared
principles, through the steps provided it not only strengthens its internal cohesion but also
enhances its standing as a symbol of collective prosperity and integrity within the European

business landscape.

**Levelling the playing field: State encouraged standards for innovation and competition**
Moreover, the dominance of BigTech corporations presents significant challenges for newcomers.
The concept of First Mover Advantage has eroded in significance, primarily due to the scarcity of
capital, the overwhelming size and influence of established BigTech entities, and their unparalleled

pace of adapting to market innovation. This creates a prisoner's dilemma, exacerbating market
failures, making it nearly impossible for smaller enterprises to compete or innovate in the same

pace or level.

To navigate this landscape and foster Digital Finance, a strategic solution emerges: the
implementation of state-encouraged standards. By establishing unified standards across Europe,
the continent can catalyze network effects, promoting seamless interoperability and collaboration
among businesses and industries. These network effects could be compared to the effects gained
by large BigTechs, who often dominate markets with proprietary standards. This approach
prioritizes inclusivity and interoperability, leading to sustainable growth and innovation. By
mandating these standards, smaller companies gain a level playing field, empowering them to
innovate and compete effectively. Late movers can still thrive if provided with secure footholds in
the market. This mitigates the risks inherent in the prisoner's dilemma and fosters a diverse and
innovative environment.

A crucial aspect of promoting Digital Finance is strengthening banks and the financial sector in
their competition with BigTech, enabling banks to drive innovations organically. This effort should
also consider the dual role of BigTech companies as both enablers and sources of dependency for
banks. BigTech firms not only challenge banks but can also provide certain technological
capabilities that can expand and support the services of banks.


Examples like the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) can show some possibilities in this

approach, establishing a baseline for market conduct and serving as catalysts for smaller players.
Extending this approach to an open financial framework (FIDA) can create a vibrant market with
new customer benefits in the medium term, provided it is focused on actual customer needs, and
it is given sufficient room for a market-driven development. Supporting banks in the innovation
race against BigTech could create a balanced and dynamic digital finance ecosystem.


**Innovative Financing Instruments**
Inspired by the German Future Financing Act (dt. Deutsches Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz), which
particularly promotes electronic securities (dt. eWPG) as well as MiCAR, the innovation of financing
instrument should set on a broader basis and fostering the development of a single European


Seite 10 / 13


capital market. Therefore, the ideas of decentralized venture capital (VC) based on MiCAR and
tokenization as well as instruments from decentralised finance could help to frame a landscape of
innovative financing instruments. By synthesizing these elements, the aim is to propel the
European financial infrastructure into a new era of accessibility, efficiency, and decentralization,

mobilizing capital within Europe.

**Innovation capital for a European FinTech ecosystem**
To establish a thriving FinTech ecosystem centered around Digital Finance solutions in Europe, it
is essential to provide capital for innovations made in Europe within the financial sector.
Furthermore, creating protected areas and sandboxes within the innovation ecosystem for testing

technology is crucial. These designated zones, a mix of technology sandbox financed by innovative
finance products based on tokenisation, offer secure spaces for experimentation and development,

like "Special Economic Zones," encouraging investment in pioneering ideas. However, regulatory
sandboxes must be restricted to supervisory regulation. In contrast to this, consumer protection
needs clear and reliable rules.

Additionally, investments in innovation are investments in the future. Such investments require
broad acceptance, but also broad awareness. A shift towards a more equity-based pension systems
in Europe can contribute to the wider availability of innovation capital and more generally a mindset
shifts among private investors. This could be accompanied by tax advantages for private capital
investments as well as employee participation programs complementing this approach. This
comprehensive strategy fuels Europe's innovation engine, fostering a dynamic ecosystem where
creativity flourishes and investments thrive.


**2.4** **Protecting the Digital Finance sector**


A trade-off has been highlighted between protection and independence from third parties from one
perspective and close international cooperation in a globalized world from another. This
cooperation can strengthen innovation and development, thereby preventing dependency.

One of the primary focuses should be support and collaboration between national cybersecurity
efforts which play a crucial role for protecting the Digital Finance sector. The recent significant
initiative is the Cyber Solidarity Act that emerges as a pivotal program to bolster our IT security
capabilities, thereby protecting Europe’s values and economy. This act, through the collaboration
of various cybersecurity agencies of the member states, could effectively function as a "Cyber
Army for Europe". Such a coordinated effort would protect the Digital Finance sector as well as all
other sectors of our economy.

Balancing competition and sovereignty in different scenarios, we can ensure that Europe's Digital
Finance sector remains both innovative and secure. Protecting access to innovation is another
solution approach: maintaining openness to new partnerships and innovations ensures that Europe
remains at the forefront of technological advancements. Regulation can support those


Seite 11 / 13


developments from the sidelines, if the overall drafting process is conducted structured,
transparent, and open way.

Another important aspect with regards to Digital Finance are investments in innovations and in

future developments of the underlying infrastructures. Besides being crucial for fostering financial
inclusion and enhancing security they are also insuring the competitiveness of our European Digital
Finance sector. Investments require a secure political environment, the basis for this is our
democracy. Currently our democracy and its institutions are coming under attack by several forces.
For this reason, we support the idea of safeguarding our democracy and its values by the
introduction of a “European Democracy Shield”, as proposed by European Commission President

Ursula von der Leyen. This shield aims at protecting democratic institutions and processes from
external interference and manipulation. Integrating collaborative efforts among member states to

defend against threats that undermine democratic integrity, this shield focuses on democracy, free
elections, and the prevention of fake news. Balancing the trade-off between protecting our
sovereignty and fostering close international cooperation will be essential in ensuring both security
and innovation in our increasingly interconnected world.

**3** **Conclusion**


By applying the Strategic Foresight method, the European Commission highlights the importance
of proactive planning and anticipating future challenges, bringing them into public discourse. The

identified areas allow for the development of future scenarios, enabling present actions to shape
the desired future.

This paper has shown that key challenges from the Strategic Foresight Report— climate change,
digital technologies, and geopolitics — also affect the rapidly evolving financial environment. These
challenges significantly influence the European digital economy, and Digital Finance is a crucial

tool for addressing them. By leveraging foresight and integrating Digital Finance into society and
the banking sector, the EU can secure a resilient, competitive, and transformative financial system

in the long term.

The second section outlines how sustainable integration of Digital Finance relies on four pillars:
Awareness, Understanding, Adapting, and Protecting. Various successful initiatives have already
advanced this integration.

However, much untapped potential remains. Innovations like artificial intelligence could
significantly revolutionize banking processes. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain
technology in the banking sector is still at an early stage of development. Realizing this potential
is essential for tackling the challenges highlighted by Strategic Foresight.
