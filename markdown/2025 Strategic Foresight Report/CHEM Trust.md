**CHEM Trust response to the European Commission 2025 Strategic Foresight Report Call for**
**Evidence**


**19 March 2025**


**Summary**


As recognised in the Call to Evidence for the 2025 Strategic Foresight Report, resilience needs to be
delivered in a sustainable, fair and democratic manner with a join up across policy priorities.


[The 2023 Foresight Report was right to identify that the sustainability transition is built on a triple](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2023%3A376%3AFIN)
promise: a healthy planet and thriving environment; economic growth that is decoupled from
resource use and environmental degradation; and an assurance that no person or place will be left
behind.


That report made strong links between environmental sustainability and economic resilience but
mostly related this to the transition to a net zero economy with some reference to the damage
caused by pollution. The 2025 Foresight report needs to make a stronger link to the EU’s ambition for
a zero pollution economy and specifically the need to reduce the production, use and import of
harmful chemicals.


CHEM Trust welcomes the opportunity to explain the importance of including chemical regulation in
the policy actions needed to strengthen resilience in the EU.


**Response to questions:**


**1.** **Scope: what are the main challenges to long-term EU resilience and what are the strengths**

**on which Europe can build it?**


The EU is facing multiple crises of climate change, chemical pollution and biodiversity loss that are
interconnected and are impacting on citizen’s health, the ecosystems that humans depend upon and
the economy.


Increasing pollution of our environment and our bodies with toxic chemicals are key challenges that
must be addressed in any strategy to ensure a resilient and desirable future. It is surprising therefore
that the last Foresight Report (2023) did not include specific reference to chemical pollution despite
containing a strong recognition of the need for environmental sustainability and wellbeing to be at
the heart of resilience. The following are key challenges to long-term EU resilience:


Health challenges


  - [Many synthetic chemicals have been linked to a range of adverse health impacts, including](https://chemtrust.org/health-impacts/)
certain hormonal cancers, negative impacts on brain development, reproductive issues, and
impacts on the normal functioning of the immune system.


  - [The International Labour Organisation has compiled evidence](https://www.ilo.org/sites/default/files/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_dialogue/@lab_admin/documents/publication/wcms_795460.pdf) of the global incidence of
deaths, illness and injuries resulting from occupational exposure to toxic chemicals.
Increasing healthcare costs as a result of exposure to chemicals are recognised by the
[European Commission here](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_24_2152) (question 1). The Commission acknowledges that _“exposure to_
_harmful chemicals may lead to severe chronic health effects, long-term environmental_
_impacts and contamination of our food and water resources” which “results in high costs to_
_society, for example for health care and pollution remediation”._


  - Any increase in illness and poor health related to the impacts of harmful chemicals will also
result in a decrease in workforce productivity.


  - [Women are disproportonately impacted by harmful chemicals due to biological, social and](https://chemtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/A-womans-perspective-on-chemicals.pdf)
occupational factors but currently EU chemicals regulation falls short in addressing the toxic
risks women face. .


Environmental challenges


  - Many synthetic chemicals are polluting EU water, soil, and food chains and many are so
persistent that they are causing irreversible contamination, as is the case with PFAS, the
[‘forever chemicals’. The 2023 Strategic Foresight Report noted that](https://chemtrust.org/pfas/) _“Large-scale action is_
_needed to strengthen EU’s water-resilience, by addressing pollution and the increasing_
_demands by agriculture, energy production, industry, or households”_ (Section III Key Areas
for Action 6).


  - [Pollution has now been identfed](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52020DC0380) as one of the five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss
alongside climate change, change in land and sea use, over exploitation, and invasive
[species. In 2022, the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/)
[considered](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16689) that pollution impacted over 11,500 out of the 83,669 animal species assessed


  - Healthy, functioning ecosystems are fundamental to human wellbeing and survival but
[scientsts recently concluded that](https://chemtrust.org/news/global-chemical-pollution/) _‘the cocktail of chemical pollution that pervades the planet_
_now threatens the stability of global ecosystems upon which humanity depends’._ Chemical
pollution, if allowed to continue, will undermine our ability to maintain clean water, sustain
food production, and protect people from the impacts of climate change that are already
‘locked in’ due to existing emissions.


  - Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are emitted at every stage of a chemical’s
[lifecycle, including producton, use and disposal. ECHA’s universal PFAS Restricton Report](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/industry/chemicals)
says that ‘some of the strongest greenhouse gases known are PFASs’.


  - [The health of the natural world is directly linked to economic sustainability. IBPES](https://www.ipbes.net/transformative-change/media-release) estimates
that over fifty percent of annual global GDP is generated by economic activities moderately
to highly dependent on nature, amounting to $58 trillion. The dependence of companies in
the euro area on services provided by nature is acknowledged in the 2023 Foresight Report
(section II.2) but there needs to be better join up with tackling the risks to nature caused by
chemical pollution.


Economic and Industrial challenges


  - In addition to the costs to health services identified above, the cost of cleaning up chemical
pollution is also a significant challenge to achieving economic resilience. There is already a
huge clean-up cost for existing or legacy pollution and the cost will become prohibitive if


emissions of the most toxic and persistent chemicals are allowed to continue without
[effective regulation. In January 2025 the Forever Polluton project, working with independent](https://foreverpollution.eu/lobbying/the-cost-methodology/)
[scientsts](https://foreverpollution.eu/lobbying/the-cost-methodology/) estimated that cleaning up pollution in Europe and the UK of PFAS chemicals could
cost €100 billion annually, equating to €2 trillion over 20 years.


  - [Some chemical companies with a vested interest in weakening the necessary regulation of](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2025/01/chemical-reaction-new-report-exposes-corporate-lobby-threat-eu-pfas-restriction)
harmful chemicals are arguing that the proposed universal PFAS restriction will cause
catastrophic economic challenges. Contrary to this, evidence shows that chemical pollution is
a financial liability for companies. For example, in 2023 PFAS manufacturers such as DuPont,
Chemours Co., and Corteva Inc. settled with drinking water providers for $1.18 billion. In
2024 a US court approved that 3M (another major PFAS producer) had to pay up to $12.5
billion to settle PFAS drinking water claims. PFAS are such problematic chemicals that even
[investors have started advising companies to move away from PFAS due to reputational,](https://chemsec.org/knowledge/iihc/)
insurance and liability risks.


  - [Switching to safer chemicals leads to long-term profts.There are a wide range of sectors in](https://chemsec.org/reports/a-profitable-detox-why-safer-chemistry-makes-financial-sense/)
which PFAS alternatives have already been implemented or are in the process of
[development. For example, over 100 companies have signed up for the “No PFAS Corporate](https://chemsec.org/pfas/#members-of-pfas-movement)
[Movement”, organised by the Swedish NGO, ChemSec. These companies are making a](https://chemsec.org/pfas/#members-of-pfas-movement)
dedicated effort to move away from PFAS in products, technologies and supply chains. Many
companies that are working at the forefront of transitioning from fossil fuels to greener
technologies (such as solar cells, wind turbines, electric vehicles, heat pumps and
semiconductors) are also showing great progress in PFAS alternative development. Overall,
there is strong evidence that industry will find solutions for alternative products and
processes without impacting on the essential needs of society.


  - Delays and uncertainty over the regulation of chemicals risks stifling innovation.


Strengths on which Europe can build


With regard to ensuring that chemical pollution is addressed as part of a resilient future the EU
needs to build on its strengths in order to better prioritise people’s health and the environment:


  - The EU REACH Regulation, finalised in 2006, is the world’s leading chemicals safety
framework. It has provided more information on chemical properties and uses than any
other regulatory system in the world and has made progress in controlling the most harmful
chemicals. It has also led to innovation of safer chemicals. However REACH now needs
updating to increase its effectiveness and efficiency. If REACH was working we would not
now be facing a multi-billion euro bill for PFAS pollution.


The EU has the backing of its citizens to strengthen the regulation of chemicals:


  - [EU citzens are supportve of policies and regulation that protect the environment and](https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/3173)
protect health from the effects of harmful chemicals. More than three-quarters of Europeans
(78%) agree that environmental issues have a direct effect on their daily life and their health.
Around four in five respondents (84%) agree that EU environmental legislation is necessary
for protecting the environment in their country. More than four in five respondents (84%)
are worried about the impact of harmful chemicals present in everyday products on their
health.


**2.** **Imagine 2040: How would you characterise a resilient EU in 2040?**


A resilient EU would be characterised by:


  - A population that is healthier than in 2025 with fewer people being exposed to harmful
chemicals through their work or via food, water and consumer products.


  - An environment with thriving nature and healthy ecosystems that can continue to sustain
human activity. For example food production will be based more on agroecological systems
that work with nature and be less reliant on chemical pesticides so that it is not damaging
the very ecosystem services that our food security depends upon such as healthy soil and
natural predators.


  - A zero pollution economy as well as a net-zero economy. Innovative technologies will be in
wide use to produce safer higher quality products without the use of harmful chemicals.


  - Sustainability will be a key factor in the EU’s competitiveness, making Europe a global leader
in ‘green’ products, services, and technologies, as well as attracting global investments and
talent.


**3.** **Society and generations: How can we ensure a resilient society and fairness between**
**generations?**


  - Intergenerational fairness requires that action is taken to ban the most harmful chemicals
because health problems caused by chemicals are passed to new generations. Chemical
[exposure is now so ubiquitous that babies are born already polluted by a cocktail of](https://www.ewg.org/research/body-burden-pollution-newborns)
[chemicals. This means that children may not reach their full potential.](https://www.ewg.org/research/body-burden-pollution-newborns)


  - Scientists are increasingly linking the increase in behavioural challenges in children to
[chemical exposure during development. Across the EU this could represent a significant](https://chemtrust.org/edcs-health/#brain-development)
decrease in intellectual ability within a generation, which may have big societal costs.


  - Future generations are also inheriting an increasingly polluted environment, making the
above listed health and environmental issues more prevalent.


**4.** **Long-term resilience: Which critical policy actions should be initiated today to strengthen**
**resilience in the EU by 2040?**


For the reasons outlined above, the regulation of chemicals that harm human health or the
ecosystem services that humans depend upon is a vital component of strengthening resilience.
CHEM Trust will focus specifically on these regulations in our answer as this is our area of expertise.
The following critical policy actions need to be acted upon without delay:


  - [Strengthen the REACH Regulaton to speed up chemicals control by streamlining processes,](https://chemtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/Simplifying-REACH-CHEM-Trust-Feb25final.pdf)
prioritising persistent, mobile and bioaccumulative chemicals for phase-out, making generic
and group bans the norm and closing data gaps to ensure transparency and effective
chemical control.


  - [Protect people and environment by regulatng endocrine disruptng chemicals](https://www.edc-free-europe.org/articles/position-paper/seven-priorities-to-protect-people-and-environment-from-endocrine-disrupting-chemicals)


  - [Support the universal PFAS Restricton.](https://chemtrust.org/universal-pfas-restriction/)


  - Enforce the polluter-pays principle and corporate responsibility, requiring chemical
companies to cover the costs of the pollution they cause.


**5.** **Synergies and tensions: What crucial synergies and tensions can be identified across**
**various EU priorities which might, respectively, help or hamper EU’s long-term resilience? How can**
**we enhance these synergies and mitigate these tensions?**


As set out above the tension between environmental regulation and a resilient competitive economy
is false and unnecessary. Nor is it the case that regulating chemicals will halt or delay the ‘clean
transition’. In the case of PFAS chemicals for example some industry lobbyists claim that there cannot
[be a clean or green transition in terms of energy without PFAS.This is not the case and CHEM Trust](https://chemtrust.org/green-economy-pfas/)
[research shows that there are alternatives to PFAS are available or in development for all key green](https://chemtrust.org/green-economy-pfas/)
transition products including heat pumps, electric vehicles and solar cells. Alternatives can certainly
be developed within the derogated timescales allowed in the proposed universal PFAS regulation.
The transition to renewable energy will not be ‘clean’ if it is based on harmful chemicals showing the
need for joined up policy making to ensure a resilient economy.


**6.** **Enhancing strategic foresight: How could the European Commission further improve its**
**approach to strategic foresight to increase its impact on designing EU policies for a desirable**
**future?**


  - The Commission can improve its approach by being more proactive about the resilience risks
listed above


  - As indicated in the last Foresight Report the join up of policy is vital. As set out above this
must include better regulation of harmful chemicals and understanding how this links to
health, environmental, gender and economic policy aims.
