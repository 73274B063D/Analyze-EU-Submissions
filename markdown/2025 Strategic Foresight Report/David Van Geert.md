feedback: 'I see the following as essential in the development of the European union:
  - If Greenland became independent, achieving its integration into the European union.
  - Building its own arms industry through which independence can be achieved from
  non-European organisations - Building a strong positioning above the Arctic Circle
  - Seek to strengthen trade between European countries - Protecting and developing
  nature - Strive for the greatest possible independence in terms of raw materials
  of all kinds (ores, minerals, etc.) - Commitment to modern nuclear energy - Commitment
  to developing knowledge in every European citizen by upgrading and revaluing education
  within European countries.'

llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise stronger European strategic autonomy,
  including building domestic industrial capacity (defence and critical materials)
  and reducing dependence on non‑European suppliers. They also converge on boosting
  intra‑European trade/integration, protecting and developing nature, and investing
  in education and skills to increase European resilience and knowledge capacity.
llm_disagreements: 'The other submission emphasizes concrete geopolitical moves (Greenland
  integration, Arctic positioning), an explicit push for a modern nuclear energy programme,
  and a direct build‑out of a European arms industry, whereas the first submission
  focuses on governance, regulatory safeguards, mission‑driven R&D (AI, biotech, SRM),
  precautionary research, and democratic oversight. There is also a difference in
  emphasis on methods: one favours rapid industrial and territorial strategies, the
  other prioritises foresight, enforcement, public deliberation, and targeted research
  infrastructure and procurement reform.'
