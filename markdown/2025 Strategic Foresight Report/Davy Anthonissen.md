feedback: 'E.U. needs to be grounded in Europe and for the world! 1. The E.U. should
  buy Brussels from Belgium, giving the E.U. a strong foundation and ending the ridiculous
  endless clash between Flanders and Wallonie over Brussels, which forced the creation
  of Belgium in the first place. 2. Arm civilians! Not after the example of the U.S.
  with guns and rifles in every house, but with regional citizen guard organisations
  under E.U. policy where all guns and rifles are kept, and where civilians can register
  to practice their firing skills and learn strategics involving the terrain of their
  surroundings. (why wait till we''re ran over, to then try create a civilian resistance
  under difficult circumstances / are we forgetting the added value of the peasants
  fighting for their freedom along armies'' side through history / and millions of
  civilian volunteers could be gathered in times of war, once they''re familiar with
  fire arms and strategics under command) 3. On actual events: Russia is struggling
  in Ukraine! Belarus provided access to Russia to invade a european sovereign state.
  Simple: annex Belarus! Give Poland its original land back which was taken by the
  Soviet Union, and some extra as compensation for the abuse during WW2! Add a part
  to Ukraine! And let the rest become a sovereign E.U. state, naming it Acervia, after
  Latin "acervus". (not only did we show the world we exist, but Russia would lose
  its forward base deep into Europe / and we would be able to stop begging, and have
  something to throw on the table)'

llm_agreements: Both submissions stress the need for a stronger, more capable Europe
  able to respond to geopolitical threats and to reduce strategic dependence on external
  actors. Each calls for enhancing European security and capacity at an EU-relevant
  level.
llm_disagreements: 'They diverge fundamentally on means, norms and policy priorities:
  one emphasizes democratic governance, rule-of-law, multilateralism, careful regulation
  of emerging technologies, climate and societal resilience, and investment in R&D
  and institutions; the other advocates unilateral, extra-legal measures such as territorial
  annexation, civilian arming/militia structures, and transactional fixes that contravene
  international norms. Their policy focus and values are therefore largely incompatible,
  with one prioritising long-term, systemic resilience and institutional safeguards
  and the other prioritising immediate militarised expansion and ad hoc security measures.'
