feedback: 'Europe is facing a competitiveness crisis and also a growing water quantity
  crisis. To address this, all measures in the Water Resilience Strategy should prioritize
  the Water Efficiency First Principle. Below are ECOLABs recommendations for the
  EU Water Resilience Strategy No EU Competitiveness without properly managing Water
  in industry: As industry uses more than 50% of freshwater in Europe it has a key
  role to play in addressing the rapidly growing gap between water supply and demand
  in the EU. This must be a key component of a truly water-resilient society. The
  water dimension should be woven into all EU policies, especially on climate and
  industry as: We cannot talk about decarbonization without talking about water We
  cannot talk about competitiveness for our industries without talking about water
  We cannot talk about AI without talking about water The good news is that: It is
  possible for industry to reduce water use, energy use and carbon emissions at the
  same time by leveraging the water-energy-productivity nexus With todays existing
  solutions, we can reduce up to 40% of companies'' water utilization while making
  them more efficient and profitable. This is especially critical for sectors like
  chemicals, semiconductors, data centers, food & beverage, and renewable hydrogen
  The EU Water Resilience Strategy (WRS) offers a unique opportunity to drive the
  adoption of sustainable water management and innovation in the water space With
  the right mechanisms and a holistic approach to water and energy, we can accelerate
  and scale existing technologies and innovations while strengthening the competitiveness
  of key EU sectors. Regional Measures: Water is local and measures that are effective
  in water-stressed areas do not have the same impact in wetter regions. The WRS should
  mandate the development of National Water Plans to: Foster water sobriety for all
  actors with clearly defined water withdrawal reduction targets Optimize resource
  availability via water conservation plans for all sectors Preserve access to water
  with targets for water reuse Circularity: Water reuse in Europe is 2.5%, while other
  regions have achieved significantly higher rates, e.g. 90% in Israel and 10% in
  California and Saudi Arabia. One major barrier to water reuse is restrictive regulation
  limiting the use of recycled water in certain sectors. France has removed these
  barriers, resulting in environmental benefits without impacting human health The
  WRS must harmonize local legislation to incentivize the highest possible amount
  of safe water reuse The WRS should be closely linked to the Clean Industrial Deal,
  the Circular Economy Act and the Vision for Agriculture Measurement: To determine
  sustainable water use, a precise quantitative assessment of water supply and demand
  at specific locations is essential. This process is vital as the inability to determine
  sustainable water use is a significant obstacle to progress in water management
  and stewardship, hindering investments needed to secure long-term business viability
  for operations and supply chains. Precise measurement is therefore a strategic imperative,
  recognizing the critical role water plays in enabling growth, profitability, and
  competitiveness The WRS must introduce an EU-wide water accounting system with enhanced
  data interoperability Funding: Achieving a truly water-resilient Europe will require
  both public and private funding for public water agencies and infrastructure The
  WRS should create Water-Transition Funds, either as a separate funding vehicle or
  under the next Multiannual Financial Framework to invest in water Water Efficiency
  First Principle: This should align closely with the EEF Principle: 1. It is anchored
  in legislation through a suitable Directive or Regulation 2. Water demand is reduced
  across all sectors without placing the burden on consumers 3. EU countries are obligated
  to consider water efficiency solutions in planning, policy, and investment'

llm_verdict: Likely Ally
llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise strengthening EU resilience and competitiveness
  through targeted policy and investment, stressing that sectoral resource needs (e.g.
  water, energy, critical technologies) must be integrated across climate and industrial
  policy. They each call for stronger legal and regulatory frameworks, better measurement
  and data systems, and public–private funding mechanisms to scale innovation and
  secure supply chains.
llm_disagreements: 'The submissions differ in scope and emphasis: one focuses on broad
  governance of emerging technologies, climate intervention research, biosecurity,
  and strategic foresight (including long-term democratic and intergenerational considerations),
  while the other concentrates tightly on operational water management—water-efficiency
  mandates, national water plans, water accounting, reuse regulatory harmonisation,
  and specific funding vehicles. They therefore prioritise different near-term instruments
  and policy entry points (high-level governance and foresight vs. targeted, immediate
  industrial water efficiency reforms).'
