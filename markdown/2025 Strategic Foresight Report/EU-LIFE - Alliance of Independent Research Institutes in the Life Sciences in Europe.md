# Scientific research is a strategic necessity for resilience and competitiveness in Europe
## EU-LIFE’s input to the EC “Call for evidence” - 2025 Strategic Foresight Report

[At a pivotal moment for Europe, the European Commission’s consultation on the 2025 Strategic Foresight](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14535-2025-Strategic-Foresight-Report_en)
[Report](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14535-2025-Strategic-Foresight-Report_en) seeks input from stakeholders on how to strengthen Europe’s long-term resilience. We hereby
provide EU-LIFE’s vision that **, as a crucial part of competitiveness, scientific research is a strategic**
**necessity for the resilience of Europe; and recall the 5 key actions that the EU must prioritize to**
**empower research in this role.**


Scientific research as a strategic need

As outlined in the European Commission’s call, resilience is not just about withstanding crises, but also about
enabling Europe to thrive in response to adversity in a sustainable, fair, and democratic manner. However,
achieving such resilience requires a solid foundation. Scientific research provides that foundation, being
indispensable for ensuring Europe’s competitiveness, innovation capacity, strategic autonomy and long-term
sustainability.


By investing in generating knowledge and fostering scientific talent, Europe seeds the innovations of
tomorrow that will drive economic growth, high-quality jobs, and deliver solutions to global challenges from clean energy to biomedical breakthroughs. Therefore, if Europe wants to be truly resilient in 2040 and
beyond, it must now empower the scientific discovery and innovation that will equip the continent to
anticipate challenges, develop evidence-based solutions, and adapt to unforeseen crises in years to come.

While **the minimum basis for a thriving European Research & Innovation is a stand-alone, well**
**budgeted FP10**, **we urge the European Commission to further follow the 5 key actions for a**
**competitive – and, thus, resilient – Europe** [outlined by EU-LIFE in October 2024](https://eu-life.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/17_10_2024_EU_LIFE_STATEMENT_FUTURE_RESEARCH.pdf) and exposed below.


5 key actions for a competitive – and resilient – Europe


_Be ambitious, yet realistic - on what to expect from Research & Innovation_
As hinted by the Draghi, Letta and Heitor reports and mission letters to the EU Commissioners, Europe needs
to aim for greater impact through its R&I programmes. This means to be ambitious and aim for longer-term,
more impactful outcomes: more focus on research and more innovation, compared to the current (Horizon
Europe) programme which has a too strong focus on implementation. [1-3] At the same time, be realistic and
acknowledge that the aims can only be achieved by raising the investment as clearly stated in Draghi’s and
Heitor Group’s reports: double the investment on R&I - and ring-fence it through the whole financial cycle. [1-]

3,6-8 However, doubling the investment to at least €220 billion would only be sufficient if the current R&I
portfolio is maintained. If the portfolio increases, e.g. by including priorities such as industrial strategies and
defence, the investment must further increase. As innovation stems from high-risk high-gain approaches,
ensure the doubling of the investment on the European Research Council (ERC) and increase the budget for
Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) [4] and the European Innovation Council (EIC), particularly on the
earlier stages of innovation [5] .

_Empower the ecosystem - of European Research & Innovation_
Be mindful on how scientific processes work and promote the ways that truly support a flourishing R&I
ecosystem to face global challenges, in realistic timelines. As underlined in the reports as well as in the
mission letters of the Commissioners, invest in people and promote talent. This should be achieved through
investing in rewarding research careers, effective knowledge transfer and cutting-edge research
infrastructure. Similarly, improve excellence of research institutions in a quality-based, open, equitable, fair
and diverse way, be it through existing or new mechanisms such as Draghi’s “ERC for institutions” idea. [2-3 ]

These elements will be key to embrace the fifth freedom put forward by Letta’s report, creating freedom of
movement of knowledge and innovation through meaningful collaboration between universities, research
institutes and businesses. This is how R&I contributes to a strong European industrial strategy: by
strengthening the European Research Area.


_Ensure coherence - of the EU R&I programme_
Ensure coherence of the R&I programme. Scattered, non-cohesive instruments hidden in between other
strategic objectives of the EU will not provide the needed European leverage on competitiveness and
innovation. Whereas the ERC and the EIC have been clearly recognized as centrepieces for the future of
research by Draghi’s report and Ursula von der Leyen’s mission letters, a deafening silence was cast upon the
essential MSCA programme, only attenuated by the Heitor group’s report. Along with the ERC [2-3] and the
EIC [5], the MSCA [4] programme as a key instrument to attract, develop, and retain talent [4 ] must remain a priority
in the upcoming financial cycle. Importantly, all three must be grouped coherently in a R&I single umbrella
that prioritises independent, expert-driven governance. However, do not fall into the trap of considering that
these excellent programmes will deliver high impact without excellent research infrastructure and clear
investment in bottom-up, discovery-driven and quality-driven collaborative research across Europe and
globally. [1,9-13]


_Strike the right balance - between directionality and bottom-up_
Find a balance between the need to streamline priorities and the need to allow for discoveries to flourish in
Europe. The reason why public and private funding should invest in R&I lays in its contribution to the
competitiveness of the economy, a safer and more sustainable environment, the wellbeing and the prosperity
of citizens. Contextualizing R&I, therefore, is important. However, this cannot mean an obsessed focus on
directionality, i.e. top-down policies on how and when researchers and innovators shall develop new ideas
and solutions. On the contrary, strong, resilient and impactful excellent research requires a clear bottom-up
approach with researchers and innovators in the driving seat. Similarly, public and private investments must
be balanced wisely. Make sure to invest public funding where the private sector cannot step in: the high
risk/high reward parts of the R&I cycle. [2-3 ] Industrial strategies should not overshadow the critical need to
invest public funding in fundamental research.


_Keep it simple - on structure_
Revolutionise R&I by translating political recognition of its worth into financial investments, but do not
pulverize the structure of European R&I programmes. Plan for an evolution of Horizon Europe that breaks
siloes inside the programme and contributes further to the common effort of making a healthy and
prosperous Europe.
