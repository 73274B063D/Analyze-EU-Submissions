### **1. Summary**

Founded in 1992, the **European Public Health Association (EUPHA)** is a leading umbrella
organization connecting researchers, policymakers, and public health professionals across
Europe. Operating in 53 WHO European Region countries, including all 27 EU Member States,
EUPHA has 87 member organizations, organizes the **European Public Health Conference**
(2,000+ professionals), coordinates the **European Public Health Week**, and publishes the
**European Journal of Public Health**, a peer-reviewed open-access journal.


In an era marked by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, the European Union
faces mounting global challenges that demand a **forward-looking and adaptive policy**
framework **. Strategic foresight offers a systematic and collaborative approach to analyzing**
**multiple possible futures,** ensuring that **public health remains resilient in the face of**
**emerging risks and transformative societal shifts.**


The European Commission has underscored resilience as a key pillar of its Strategic Foresight
Reports, framing it as the capacity to anticipate, withstand, and adapt to disruptions while
maintaining core functions. This approach to resilience spans across economic, social,
geopolitical, and environmental dimensions, emphasizing the need for cross-sectoral
synergies and long-term preparedness. **Public health, as a foundational element of European**
**resilience, must integrate foresight methodologies to remain agile in an evolving global**
**landscape.**


This document, leveraging the knowledge and expertise of **one of EUPHA’s 28 dedicated**
**thematic sections**, prepared by EUPHA, responds to the European Commission’s public
consultation on the 2025 Strategic Foresight Report. It highlights the **urgent need to**
**institutionalize foresight within public health policymaking, ensuring that Europe can**
**anticipate and effectively respond to future health challenges** . By strengthening scenario
planning, investing in AI-driven early warning systems, and fostering cross-sectoral
collaboration, we can move towards a **future-proof public health system** that is equipped to
**manage uncertainties, mitigate risks, and enhance societal well-being.**


The recommendations outlined in this document are **informed by leading foresight studies**,
**scenario analysis, and policy evaluations.** They present a structured framework for
embedding resilience into public health governance, offering concrete actions to align with the
European Commission’s broader foresight strategy. **As public health threats grow**
**increasingly interconnected with climate change, digital transformation, security risks, and**
**demographic shifts, foresight must evolve into a central instrument of European policy,**
**ensuring that preparedness is proactive rather than reactive.**

### **2. Foresight and public health resilience**

Foresight in public health is essential for anticipating future challenges and ensuring
resilience. **Compared to climate change, technological innovation, and economic forecasting,**
**strategic foresight in public health remains underdeveloped.** While these fields have
successfully institutionalized foresight-driven approaches, public health has been slower to
adopt systematic foresight methodologies **. To ensure resilience, public health foresight must**
**catch up with these domains by leveraging existing expertise, mobilizing resources, and**
**investing in capacity-building initiatives.**

**We recommend the Commission to:**












### **3. Developing health scenarios to address broad uncertainties**

**Health foresight must extend beyond biomedical threats to consider a wide range of**
**uncertainties, including geopolitical shifts, climate change, socio-cultural transformations,**
**and technological disruptions.** Scenario planning must account for these diverse influences,
allowing policymakers to imagine futures that significantly differ from our current reality. By
**embracing uncertainty**, we can develop adaptable and resilient health policies that remain
effective under multiple future conditions.

**We recommend the Commission to:**

### **4. Addressing shared European public health challenges**

Across Europe, public health challenges exhibit strong similarities, particularly concerning the
**ageing population and its far-reaching impact on disease burden**, formal and informal
healthcare structures, and overall quality of life. Our societies are not yet adequately prepared
to manage these long-term demographic changes. Foresight can provide the tools necessary
to **anticipate these transformations**, allowing countries to **share best practices and implement**
**forward-thinking strategies that enhance preparedness.**

**We recommend the Commission to:**








### **5. Foresight-informed policy strategies: moving beyond evidence-** **based approaches**

While **evidence-based** policymaking remains essential, it must be complemented by
**foresight-informed** approaches that account for uncertainties and alternative futures. Policy
development should integrate **both empirical data and speculative projections** to navigate the
complexity of future public health landscapes. This **dual approach** will **enable more adaptive,**
**resilient policy frameworks** that can respond effectively to emerging challenges.

**We recommend the Commission to:**

### **6. Accounting for normative uncertainties in health prioritization**

Strategic foresight must recognize that **different stakeholders have varying priorities**
**regarding public health outcomes** . **Some may prioritize longevity, while others emphasize**
**quality of life, reducing health inequalities, or minimizing healthcare expenditures.** These
normative values should be **explicitly acknowledged** **and incorporated into foresight**
**methodologies** to ensure that public health strategies align with diverse societal expectations.

**We recommend the Commission to:**








### **7. The need for a long-term perspective in public health foresight**

**Public health transformations are slow** and require long-term strategies that extend over
several decades. To achieve **meaningful and sustainable outcomes, foresight initiatives must**
**adopt a multi-decade horizon** while ensuring that **immediate policies align with long-term**
**objectives** . Policymakers must integrate long-range forecasting into their planning processes,
ensuring that today’s decisions contribute to future resilience.

**We recommend the Commission to:**

### **8. Weak signal detection and AI-driven foresight**

The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the necessity of better detecting weak signals—subtle
indicators of potential public health crises that may otherwise go unnoticed. **AI and big data**
**analytics offer promising tools to systematically identify and analyze weak signals, enabling**
**early interventions.** Strengthening our capacity for weak signal detection will be critical in
preventing future health crises and ensuring timely response mechanisms.

**We recommend the Commission to:**










### **9. Supporting capacity building in public health foresight**

Foresight remains a **fragmented** **discipline** in public health, with **limited structured**
**collaboration between practitioners and policymakers** . Strengthening the exchange of
expertise and methodologies should be a high priority **. As a leading European public health**
**network, EUPHA can play a pivotal role in fostering foresight capacity-building efforts,**
**facilitating knowledge-sharing, and positioning foresight as a fundamental pillar of health**
**governance.**

**We recommend the Commission to:**




### **Conclusion**

Public health foresight must evolve to match the strategic depth and influence seen in other
disciplines. By incorporating broad uncertainty analysis, addressing shared European
challenges, and leveraging AI-driven weak signal detection, we can build a more resilient and
adaptive public health system. **EUPHA’s leadership in fostering foresight capacity and**
**promoting long-term health strategies will be instrumental in ensuring that public health**
**remains at the forefront of European policy development.**
