feedback: 'The European Union faces significant challenges to long-term resilience
  while possessing substantial strengths upon which to build. Environmental pressures,
  including climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource scarcity, represent major
  threats, while outdated governance structures struggle to handle contemporary demands.
  Technological dependencies, particularly in digital services and critical minerals,
  add complexity to the challenge. Despite these challenges, the EU maintains powerful
  foundations: a strong institutional framework, leadership in environmental policy
  through the European Green Deal, extensive infrastructure, growing research capabilities,
  and high social cohesion. By 2040, the EU envisions itself as a global leader characterized
  by net-zero emissions, digital sovereignty, robust social cohesion, adaptive governance,
  and strong environmental stewardship. Achieving this vision requires immediate action.
  Critical policy initiatives include integrating climate risks into security frameworks,
  developing renewable energy sovereignty, creating circular economy systems, implementing
  digital sovereignty measures, and establishing multilateral climate security approaches.
  To ensure intergenerational fairness, the EU must implement just transition frameworks,
  develop green job opportunities, create universal civic service programs, invest
  in lifelong learning platforms, and establish sustainable pension systems. Key synergies
  exist between green and digital transitions, social and economic policies, and internal
  and external security measures. However, tensions must be managed between economic
  growth and environmental protection, national sovereignty and EU integration, and
  short-term costs versus long-term benefits. To enhance strategic foresight, the
  Commission should implement regular horizon scanning exercises, strengthen member
  state communication networks, systematically integrate foresight scenarios into
  policy design, develop adaptive governance models, and enhance stakeholder participation
  in foresight processes. Success depends on leveraging existing strengths while actively
  addressing current challenges through enhanced strategic foresight and careful management
  of synergies across policy domains. The transformation to a resilient EU by 2040
  requires fundamental changes in governance approaches. Moving beyond traditional
  top-down leadership, the EU needs to adopt more adaptive models based on orchestration,
  facilitation, experimentation, co-creation, and collaboration. This transformation
  necessitates differentiated integration strategies that respect Member States''
  unique contexts while fostering collective progress. The regulatory system must
  evolve to incorporate open innovation ecosystems, experimental arenas, and outcome-based
  legislation rather than rigid rules. Success in this volatile context requires a
  new, reinvigorated approach that leverages qualities and competencies such as openness,
  inclusiveness, agility, strategic sensitivity, and the ability to adapt quickly
  to changing environments. Ultimately, building EU resilience by 2040 also demands
  a cultural shift in governance and policymaking. The EU must move beyond its current
  risk-averse approach while maintaining its commitment to democratic values and social
  welfare. This requires developing greater responsibility and engagement among citizens,
  potentially including sacrifices for the common good. Strategic autonomy, particularly
  regarding Big Tech, digital services, and IT industry independence, emerges as a
  crucial focus. Europe should drive, shape, and prepare for transformations related
  to AI. Success will depend on the ability to balance competing interests, unlock
  ecosystem development, and maintain prosperity for citizens in an increasingly turbulent
  world. The EU''s future resilience will be shaped by its ability to transform environmental
  and social challenges into opportunities for progress, leadership and partnership
  development.'

Contribution
**Call for Evidence** on the _**2025 Strategic Foresight Report**_

_**Achieving Resilience**_

_**by 2040**_


Supporting research and findings


Hereinbelow five contributions are presented containing earnest reflections and perspectives on the
central issues raised in the Call for Evidence regarding _2025 Strategic Foresight Report_ . These inputs
provided expertise and a supporting evidence base that informed the concise response submitted by
the Egmont Institute to the CfE.

# **Egmont Institute – Contribution 1**


As strategic foresight is based on collective intelligence; the Commission seeks evidence-based input
particularly on the following questions:

- **Scope** : What are the main challenges to long-term EU resilience and what are the strengths on
which Europe can build it?


`o` One major challenge to EU resilience will be to tackle the multiple environmental crises:

climate change, biodiversity loss, water resource scarcity, air/soil/water pollution,
biogeochemical cycles perturbations, etc. (see ‘planetary boundaries’ concept). Those
issues do not only lead to resource scarcity, public health degradation, and natural
disasters, but they also affect social balance inside and outside EU and international
geopolitical dynamics as they can generate conflicts which will impact the EU directly or
indirectly.

`o` A successful environmental transition and thereby reaching the EU’s climate and

environmental objectives, will bring many opportunities to increase EU resilience
(decrease dependency on fossils fuels, decrease health problems, reduce climate change
impacts, etc.) but could also bring its own resilience challenges (dependency on new types
of resources and technologies, risks of social imbalance during the transition process,
etc.). The way EU will choose to make its transition will play an important role in its
resilience level.


`o` Good adaptation to climate change is a key element for the resilience of the EU. Climate

conditions are already changing, and the frequency of extreme climate events is
increasing. Europe must adapt in order to increase its resilience. The European Climate
Risk Assessment (EUCRA) (2024, EEA) provides a strong basis on which we can rely to
prioritize action, as it identifies key climate risks and areas requiring urgent attention
(some key adaptation priorities are flood management, heatwave preparedness and
resilient infrastructure). A challenge, however, will be to work together efficiently at both
the EU and Member State levels to ensure that Europe is well prepared for these
increasing risks. In this context, the European Climate Adaptation Plan (ECAP) could be a
key tool to bridge the gap between the priorities set by EUCRA and concrete action at the
national level, fostering coordination and ensuring that adaptation measures are
effectively implemented across Europe.

- **Imagine 2040:** How would you characterise a resilient EU in 2040?

In 2040, EU citizens live in a healthy environment, social cohesion is strong, economic activity allows
everyone to live decently, EU is on track with its climate, environmental and social objectives, has
adapted its critical infrastructures and areas and is prepared for extreme climate events and other
crisis. Risk management is fully integrated into policymaking, allowing for proactive adaptation and
crisis response.

At the international level, the EU has built strong and diversified partnerships, it has reduced its
dependency on imports and exports wherever these entail negative socio-economic or
environmental impacts, has derisked its external economic and trade relationships, in particular
through rethinking strategic value chains and diversifying them. The EU is also an active player at the
international level to help mitigate, adapt and react to environmental and other global crises.

- **Society and generations** : How can we ensure a resilient society and fairness between
generations?

Same elements as above.
In 2040:

`o` EU manages, preserves and effectively restores its own natural capital in a sustainable

way, making sure future generations will have access to, at least, the same level of natural
capital (in terms of quantity and quality);


2


`o` The EU strongly reduces its dependency to the natural capital outside of EU

(import/export of resources, food, etc.), taking into account planetary boundaries and
social fairness;

`o` The EU is on track with its environmental objectives, for example in terms of climate

change and GHG emissions, it has a clear long-term vision and plan on how to stay on
track and it has succeeded in putting into place the right tools to ensure a just transition,
a sustainable access to the resources it needs (through the development of a bio-based
and circular economy, local production/extraction plans to use and produce renewable
resources such as biomass in a sustainable way and strong & diversified partnerships) and
the development of a strong net-zero industry inside the EU.

`o` The EU is prepared for natural disasters due to climate changes: All required physical

adaptation and prevention measures have been deployed or are planned (incl. land
planning measures), adaptation to climate change & resilience criteria’s have been
integrated in every new investment for several years now, emergency plans are clear and
regularly updated and emergency services are well-trained and ready to intervene,
citizens are aware of the risks and of the procedures in case of emergency, plans and
funds are also secured to manage loss and damages due to unexpected events, etc.
Investments in adaptation measures are made without increasing the public deficit for
future generations as they did not cause climate change;

`o` The EU is an active player at the international level to help mitigate, adapt and react to

climate and environmental crises at the global level.

- **Long-term resilience:** Which critical policy actions should be initiated today to strengthen
resilience in the EU by 2040?


`o` To reduce dependency on fossil fuels:

§ stay the course on climate change objectives by adopting an ambitious EU climate
target for 2040 and review the EU’s long-term strategy to 2050.
§ Focus on effective emission reductions and limit the use of CCS.
§ Also: specific policies are necessary to decarbonize the fossil carbon feedstock
used in industry and to incentivize the use of renewable carbon sources (biobased or based on direct air capture);


3


`o` Reduce our dependency on resources and diversify the type of resources we use. Efficient

use of resources, eco-design et strategic prioritization/allocation of resource uses can play
a significant role. Innovation is also key in order to develop technologies that are less
resource-intensive and develop new types of materials;

`o` Secure and diversify access to key resources by developing circular economy, local

production/extraction and strong & diversified partnerships for import/export;


`o` Develop new net-zero industrial sectors inside EU;


`o` Develop a strong just transition framework, making sure the transition is within

everyone’s reach, does not leave anyone behind, and wherein the opportunities of the
transition are accessible to all;


`o` Resilient nature: Preserve and restore natural ecosystems in the EU. Provide space for

nature, promote connectivity and promote diversification;

`o` Develop an integrated and systemic approach to risk assessment to address the

complexity of the climate risks;

`o` Adaptation reflex: integrate adaptation to climate change within each project and each

new investment;


`o` Develop a strong financing framework (public & private finance) for climate transition and

climate adaptation;


`o` Develop and implement emergency plans & procedures for natural disasters;


`o` Develop and implement loss & damage management plans and funds;


`o` Regularly monitor technological, scientific and societal evolutions, trends and seeds of

changes and evaluate how it can affect (positively or negatively) the transition.


4


- **Synergies and tensions** : What crucial synergies and tensions can be identified across various EU
priorities which might, respectively, help or hamper EU’s long-term resilience? How can we
enhance these synergies and mitigate these tensions?


`o` Tensions:

§ A strong focus on short term competitiveness objectives and the reduction of
administrative burden could hamper the long-term viability and resilience of EU
businesses and the achievement of long-term objectives.
§ EU deficit and debt rules encourage member states to reduce public expenditures
while high amounts of new investment are needed to reach climate-neutrality and
resilience goals, including from public actors.

`o` Synergies:

§ Reaching the energy efficiency and climate objective has the potential to strongly
improve EU resilience.
§ The new council directive on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the
member states encourages member states to include in their national mediumterm budgetary framework an assessment of the macrofiscal risks from climate
change and its environmental and distributional impacts. This synergy could be
enhanced by making this assessment mandatory.

- **Enhancing strategic foresight:** How could the European Commission further improve its approach
to strategic foresight to increase its impact on designing EU policies for a desirable future?


`o` The Commission has published foresight scenarios in 2023. It is mentioned in the report

that those scenarios can be used in order to stress-test EU policies.

§ It would be very helpful to have a first analysis of how those scenarios have been
used since then: Was it actually used to stress-test and improve some EU policy
and in which case? how can this type of exercise be improved for future uses?
§ Article 6, §4 of the European Climate Law specifies that: “The Commission shall
assess the consistency of any draft measure or legislative proposal, including
budgetary proposals, with the climate neutrality objective set out in Article 2(1)
and the Union 2030 and 2040 climate targets before adoption (…)”. A similar idea
could be used with the foresight scenarios, which could be regularly updated and
systematically used to assess the resilience of a new measures.


5


`o` Increase communication around foresight analysis toward Member states, and create an

active network on foresight data and practices to exchange views, to present ongoing
studies and insights, so that actors in various member states can learn from each other
and cooperate.

`o` Conduct recurrent horizon scanning per thematic (could be per sector for example), in

order to share with/between MS what are the trends, new technologies and other seeds
of changes identified that can affect it at short/medium/long term and that should be
taken into account in today’s policies.


`o` In addition to those explorative foresight exercises, which underline majors trends, risks

and opportunities, quantitative and normative foresight exercises and scenario modelling
are also key in order to inform policy making. Such exercises have already been widely
used by the Commission for the energy sector with the energy scenarios developed at EU
level, but could go even further by sharing detailed data at MS level including for nonenergy sectors, gathering and comparing scenarios from different actors at EU level, and
clearly linking scenarios with their potentials impacts (macro-economic impacts,
resources consumption, investment needs, employment, etc.).

# **Egmont Institute – Contribution 2**

_The EU's foresight strategy should aim to make the EU a new model of environmental-social-economic_
_governance, fully aware of the risks of climate change and turning these risks into opportunities to_
_create new leadership for the future and for new and renewed partnerships: "If we are going to live_
_in a world of disruption, we might as well embrace the disruption and get a head start on creating_
_new models of society."_

**Some challenges identified for the long-term EU resilience:**


  - Ensuring the continued prosperity of an economic sector while developing environmentally
friendly activities that limit the risks of climate change

  - The preservation and reinforcement of social welfare and social cohesion among all
Europeans

  - An age pyramid less favorable to economic development and territorial Defence and the risks
of economic impoverishment

  - The need for political, economic and innovative leadership that transcends the nationalist
visions of EU Member States.

  - Dependency on critical minerals based on the scarcity of supply, the cost of extraction
(financial and environmental) and the importance of the material to European industry

  - The geopolitical implications of critical minerals supply chains and the risks of overdependence on a few dominant suppliers.

  - The need to develop collective defence in an unstable world and as wars over natural
resources increase.

  - The requirement for armed forces to prepare for and respond to climate-related threats to
ensure operational readiness in an increasingly volatile environment.

  - The need to shift from reactive crisis management to proactive policies and envisioning the
future

**Some existing strengths could be highlighted:**


  - The EU acts as a stakeholder, honouring its commitments and helping to stabilise trade.

  - The EU is leading an ambitious European Green Deal with a set of new policies and legislation

  - Europe benefits from a high-quality infrastructure network (economic, communication and
transport) that strengthens social, economic and territorial cohesion.

  - A research and innovation sector with significant growth potential and a historic moment
when the “potential brain drain” from the US could benefit European research.


7


**Imagine 2040:**

In 2040, after a tense period of conflict and economic and social collapse, the EU has positioned itself
as a global pioneer through:

  - The development of a global ethics on technology such as AI by legislating to prevent potential
social excesses (fake news, radicalization, etc.) and by investing massively in the development
of the tool in cutting-edge technical sectors (medicine, construction, climate change,
biomimicry, etc.)

  - The implementation of fair and sustainable extraction practices for critical minerals through
innovative technologies and the development of legislation and regulatory framework in line
with a societal and environmental balance

  - The establishment of new democratic governance structures set-up through the creation of
a civic service based on the establishment of a universal allowance for all citizens.

  - The signing of bilateral agreements with partner countries where the issue of human rights
and ethical standards matters remain central.

  - Slowing down the privatization of social services and returning basic services to public
administration.


As the world remains unstable, border control is being tightened, but the EU is investing in the
creation of partnerships in order to stabilise the new world orders:

  - Establishing preferential partnerships with the BRICS and rebuilding a diplomatic relationship
with the USA.

  - On its eastern flank, the EU is investing in mutually beneficial trade agreements with Russia

  - The EU is taking the lead in developing regulatory tools to prevent the monopolisation of
markets (particularly by single individuals)

  - As organised crime has become a major global issue, the fight against it is a central focus of
EU policy

  - A European Defence is created with two central roles: security and resilience (ensuring
defence, the power of deterrence, and the coordination of support management in the event
of a climate crisis).


The development of a civic service encourages the establishment of intergenerational solidarity. This
aspect of community service aims to coordinate solidarity on a local scale to ensure that the quality
of life is maintained for the entire population, thus preventing the physical and cognitive decline of
the elderly population (and the associated cost to social security).

**Critical policy actions should be initiated today:**

Support, at NATO level and in the context of financial investment in the reorientation of European
defence, a reflection on the role of defence at European level in the management of the climate crisis
and natural disasters.

Launch multilateral approaches to climate security and the management of critical minerals:

  - Continue the Green Deal and pursue institutional reforms to integrate climate risks into
security frameworks, increased investment in sustainable energy infrastructure, and greater
economic equity in the global distribution of natural resources.

  - Establish a multilateral dialogue on the risks of socio-political conflict that arise when natural
resources or critical minerals are controlled or exploited by foreign entities, and its multiplier
effects on regional stability.

Use the energy transition to limit dependence on fossil fuels and develop energy sovereignty based
on an energy mix of renewables, nuclear energy and energy conservation.

  - Develop action plans for energy distribution to deal with future crises.

  - Create a European model of energy saving, new consumption models and inclusivity.

  - Strengthen continuous training in ecological transition and innovation in terms of tomorrow's
skills to promote maximum employment.

  - Strengthen regulation to ensure compliance with social and environmental standards to force
the development of a new social paradigm based on the EU acquis.

Improvement of policies aimed at social cohesion and the integration of migrants, through vocational
training in the professions where there are labour shortages and in green job in response to the
ageing of the European population and its impact on socio-economic conditions.

# **Egmont Institute – Contribution 3**

European governance is driven by a myriad of different state and non-state actors with often
discordant agendas and interests that are increasingly difficult to channel into common visions and
implement. It operates in an extremely complex, volatile and unpredictable context and is faced with
challenges that in their scope, depth and complexity exceed by far what the EU’s founding fathers
could have ever imagined the Union and her member countries’ political institutions to cope with.

For any organising system (be it political, economic, or societal) to not only sustain in such context, but
to turn its immanent challenges into opportunities and prosper, a set of specific skills is necessary. These
include, most importantly, _openness_ and _inclusiveness_, _agility_, _strategic sensitivity_ and the ability to
_adapt_ in and to rapidly changing environments. This is particularly true for the governance system of
the EU and its Member States, if the Clean Industrial Deal is to avoid the transition failure of the Green
Deal.

However, the governance system of the EU and its Member States was designed fundamentally in the
1950s, inspired by governance concepts of the 1930s New Deal. They were designed for predictable
(controllable) environments, and have largely failed to develop the above skills despite globalisation,
technological progress and the socio-economic transformations that they triggered. Neither the EU
institutions nor most of Member States administrations have yet undergone real systemic adaptation
to the new contextual conditions and updated their political decision-making and -implementing
systems. European governance has essentially remained unchanged to what it was half a century ago,
stuck in logics of traditional top-down leadership and old regulatory trajectories seeking to _control_
phenomena that however can no longer be controlled or regulated.

New approaches to governance and political leadership are therefore required that build on
_management, orchestration_ and _facilitation_, as well as _experimentation_, _co-creation_ and _collaboration_ .
Managing innovation policy in a 4.0 context requires innovative political and administrative
management, which in turn requires fundamental institutional, procedural and cultural redesign of
EU governance at its various levels.

Debates often focus on the Commission as the main actor seemingly responsible of managing EU
policies and driving governance reform. There is a structural lack of independent foresight as the basis
alignment and for horizontal coordination and coherence in managing policies, inside EU and national
institutions and between them.


10


Council and Commission need to refocus on their actual key tasks: Creating common visions and
objectives on how to deliver prosperity to their citizens in an ever-more turbulent world where member
states can no longer act alone. This requires a pragmatic and outcomes focussed approach, not
primarily a legalistic procedural one. Objectives must determine methods.

In a more diverse Europe of 27 and more one day, one-size-fits-all approaches are mostly unsuited to
realise common objectives. A stronger recognition of a multi-speed EU is needed, building on the
concept of variable geometry. Differentiated integration approaches are required that better account
for Member States idiosyncrasies rather than total harmonisation that may not fit to the national
contexts. This needs a) better coordination within Member States, b) strengthening inter-governmental
cooperation at European level, and c) re-thinking supranational leadership in favour of stewardship,
orchestration and facilitation rather than top-down command and control.

Differentiated integration approaches stand in contrast with the Community Method with its focus on
legalistic procedure that has proven increasingly unsuited to govern societies in situations of volatility
and complexity. A new understanding of supranational leadership is necessary, based on _orchestration_
_and stewardship:_


v Orchestration: Brings parties and resources together, channels responsibilities, and establishes

_leadership groups_ . Orchestration should be the task of the Commission, but these groups
should be constituted by all relevant actors: EU institutions and Member States, business,
research/academia, that collaboratively manage and co-create. Such approach can restore trust,
allocate ownership, improve cooperation and thereby help make the system overall more
flexible and agile.

v Stewardship: It is necessary to acknowledge that there are multiple agendas and interests in

the EU that are not aligned and perhaps, there is even a distinct lack of intention to align them
to protect vested interests. Alignment alone cannot overcome this problem; _active stewardship_
is necessary to walk through the fault lines and unlock the blockages that hinder the creation
of ecosystems.

Innovation policy (like most other modern policies) is by definition multi-disciplinary and spans across
different policy areas. In the EU, this overlap is not always accounted for. Both in the Commission and
in many national administrations, political objectives does not percolate (fast) enough from the
hierarchy to the operational levels and horizontal coordination between the different DirectorateGenerals or departments concerned with the same issue. This requires stronger efforts in national and
EU administrations to better connect the dots in the EU’s multi-layered governance system, vertically
and horizontally.


11


To develop more strategic flexibility and coherence between EU and national policies, the Open Method
of Coordination should be re-designed and politically more strongly recognised. Though not
automatically translated into hard law, these can lead to such or inspire Member States adopting special
solutions. Adapted to the digital age (e.g. in form of platforms), it can provide for flexible and effective
inter-governmental cooperation on issues not or only partially within the EU competence but where
the spill-over of economic, geopolitical, ecological or social developments require countries to
cooperate in order to manage their individual interests in common.

The EU regulatory system needs to develop new methods and procedures that can respond faster and
more efficiently to challenges and opportunities in a “vuca” context. The following should be
considered:


v _Open innovation ecosystems_ : EU institutions and Member States need to more strongly pull

actors and resources and abolish barriers which hinder interaction and co-creation within.

v Experimental arenas for innovation, innovation meeting points, need to be created: actors

(orchestrated by the Commission) from the various relevant backgrounds can come together,
take off their “medals” and test and _proto-type_ regulatory solutions.


v The current EU impact assessment system, based mostly on theoretical assessments, need to

be complemented with, or even replaced by, _real-world experiments_ of proposed regulatory
solutions.


v Regulation in a digital economy needs to be smart in that it sets less fixed rules but rather Key

Performance Indicators (KPIs) and allows for self-organisation.


v EU legislation needs to be _outcome-based_, posing restrictions only that are necessary to achieve

the outcome. This includes the ability to _challenge legislation_ when it does not work and
abolish/revise it.


v The EU regulatory system needs to support _societal grass-root initiatives_ and partner-up with

them.

EU multi-annual policy programmes are not flexible enough to change in a “vuca” context (volatile,
uncertain, complex, ambiguous). They are action-driven, not purpose-driven. This is a system-defect:
multi-annual programmes are subject to Treaty-procedures and decided by Council and Parliament. An
inter-institutional effort would therefore be necessary to make innovation policy programmes more
flexible and outcome-based.


12


Innovation requires _strategically targeted funding_ to support niches and (regional) innovation clusters.
EU funding is too static and slow in allocating money where it is needed to support scale-up. A _rapid_
_response funding system_ should be put in place. Lastly, the Capitals Market Union initiative needs a
stronger political push and commitment to overcome fragmentation in the EU financial market and
better incentive private equity.

Public administrations have often inappropriate or outdated bureaucratic methods. Human resource
policies in public institutions (EU and national) need to develop leadership skills for alignment of
different views and interests, for open innovation and life-long learning. EU and national
administrations need to make a determined effort to attract more technology talents into the public
service and to train their staff to better connect the political with the operational/implementing levels.

# **Egmont Institute – Contribution 4**

**The core of the issue**

It is important to give the triple environmental crisis the centrality it deserves when we address the
issue of resilience. The underlying driver that is creating unprecedented amounts of uncertainty and
risk in the international system is the breakdown of the ecosystems (and the associated looming
tipping points). Those ecosystems were stable and predictable and have been supporting during
hundreds of years the development of modern and complex societies. That support no longer exists.
It is important to address ecosystem breakdown because all the threats and uncertainties that EU is
facing the coming decades would be solvable within existing economic and political paradigm, if it
weren’t for the triple crisis. The triple crisis, however, is forcing us to revolutionize our social and
economic systems and the thinking behind those systems.

It’s not possible anymore to engineer ourselves out of the environmental crisis. The crisis is there,
and it is going to change everything, including the potential pathways towards solutions. To limit the
breakdown, to reverse it where possible and to adapt to the changes and uncertainties that are
already built into the system technological fixes are welcome but won’t be enough. We will need a
moral revolution. We will have to redefine what a ‘good life’ is and reconsider values as solidarity,
compassion and frugality. We will have to shift from abundance of competition, goods and energy to
abundance of cooperation and equality.

And we will have to focus attention on our relationship with the living planet around us (instead of
letting ourselves be fooled by powerful Silicon Valley oligarchs that want to make us believe in the
nihilist fairytale of colonizing planet Mars (where we wouldn’t survive a second)). We will need to
listen more to ecologists, farmers, artists and urban planners and less to oligarchs and asset managers.

**Main challenges and strengths**

We don’t like to change the systems. Because there is powerful and well-organized opposition to
defend vested interest. Additionally, it is very human reflex to revert to the past in times of crisis.
Nostalgia is a powerful and dangerous driver of political mobilization that risks making us move in the
wrong direction.

We will have to collectively imagine new futures that we all can project ourselves in. And those
futures will be vastly different of what many of us are hoping for. An uphill battle, but it is time to
start the collective conversation about that desirable future. Only by starting the conversation will


14


we able to align a critical mass of the public opinion that we need to shift things. And it is by starting
to live today according to that desirable future that things will move in the right direction.

And we have options, there are different pathways: the futures are not only doom and gloom. That
future can also be a solarpunk future: A combination of technological progress and a lifestyle
associated with drastically reduced energy and material consumption. (As per Wikipedia: _Solarpunk_
_[is a literary and artistic movement, close to the hopepunk movement, that envisions and works toward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary)_
_[actualizing a sustainable future interconnected with nature and community. The "solar" represents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development)_
_[solar energy as a renewable energy source and an optimistic vision of the future that rejects climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy)_
_[doomerism, while the "punk" refers to do it yourself and the countercultural, post-capitalist, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomer)_
_[sometimes decolonial aspects of creating such a future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoloniality)_ ).

Europe has strengths. Many of us believe in the power of equality and the rule of law. Many of us
believe that private initiative and strong public regulation are a powerful combination. Many of us
believe in the need to protect minorities. Many of us believe in science. Many of us believe in
collective action. These are the unique qualities of the European ‘way of live’ that we have to name,
cherish and strengthen.

# **Egmont Institute – Contribution 5**

**What are the key possible drivers behind the EU’s need for greater future resilience, both in terms**
**of possible future shocks and long-term developments?**


  - Ongoing key drivers: consequences of climate change/extreme weather/environmental
degradation and geostrategic and geoeconomic tensions;


  - Loss of leverage of EU at the global level, Breaking up of traditional coalitions (cooperation
with US) and cooperation frameworks, internal weakening of EU, NATO without US;


  - Breaking up of multilateral framework, international rule-based order;


  - EU main target of culture war by global conservative alliance, polarisation and isolation of EU,
more pressure on energy and resources security of supply, weaponisation of economic
relations, digital services, cyber and hybrid warfare;


  - Loss of control over AI;


  - Demographic shifts, in combination with migration pressures. Shortage of skills in Europe.

**Which capacities do we currently possess, and which should we aim to develop by 2040,**
**particularly those we are currently lacking, to enhance EU resilience?**


  - Given differences of risks and threats between Member States, need for adequate national
capacities, analysis, preparedness and resilience plans (principles of subsidiarity and
proportionality);


  - Cooperation, coordination and networking at EU and NATO level is indispensable in terms of
preparedness, resilience and response. EU cooperation to be complementary with NATO
work, avoid overlap, in particular in following up on base line requirements. Member States
implementation of EU and NATO base line requirements to converge in one National
Resilience Plan;

  - Improve quality of policies and measures, using of evidence as well as foresight based
strategic policy development. In parallel to work at Ms level, also at EU level we need a holistic
approach covering the full risk cycle:

      - Identification and anticipation of threats via an EU level risk assessment, early
warning;

      - Cooperation to be underpinned by joint analysis and horizontal playbooks by type of
crisis;

      - Strengthening of preparedness through exercises on the ground, not only table top
exercises;

      - Political and strategic direction, coordination by IPCR. Important guidance from
Niniisto report and Preparedness Union Strategy;

      - Comprehensive, whole of government approach at the level of strategic policy
development and strategic steering (IPCR), giving overall direction to work in sectorial
tools, such as UCPM, ERCC and military command structures;

      - Systematic evaluation and lessons learned from crisis response operation;

      - Optimise civilian and military cooperation and synergies, while building on/respecting
existing structures and procedures. This will facilitate dual use investments. Integrate
security and safety policies and procedures, where necessary and useful.

**Which vulnerabilities could hinder our resilience by 2040, potentially pulling us back?**


  - Weakening of existing alliances and cooperation frameworks, such as NATO. Reduced
regional and global engagement and solidarity. Importance of contingency planning and need
to have our own plan at national and EU level;


  - Internal political fragmentation within the EU; critical attitude and internal division towards
necessary reforms and improvements of joint operational procedures and structures;


  - Comprehensive approach is key at strategic level and level of political direction. At the
operational level keep focus on actual crisis response, making a distinction between
addressing structural long-term challenges and actual crisis management. Avoid blurring
those lines, at the risk of creating overlap, duplication with fora and instruments, addressing
those structural long-term challenges;

  - Dependency on critical infrastructure, affected by coalition shifts and weaponisation of
connectivity and digital services. Need to strengthen substantially, at high financial and
societal cost, strategic autonomy in terms of infrastructure and digital services (need for
European Bigtech, interconnections, cables, digital services, observation,
telecommunications, satellites – to be determined), in addition to costly effort to enhance
defence capabilities and industry. Prepare public opinion for impact on society and income;


  - Multiannual Financial Framework and strategic priority choices at EU level, most likely also
ongoing budgetary pressures at Member States level;


  - Multitude and scale of crises, risks of getting overstretched at EU and MS level.

**How would you define a resilient EU in 2040?**


  - An EU that has the internal strength, cohesion and means, supported by a joint will to act
together and adequate institutional balances, to be prepared to respond effectively to
upcoming known and unknown threats and challenges;


  - The EU capacity should be supported and complemented by agreed and institutionalised
cross border cooperation with neighbours and allies;


  - As threats/crises are increasingly complex and often the consequence of weaponisation, a
whole of society approach, underpinned by civil-military cooperation and involvement of
citizens and the private sector, should be the rule. Buy-in of the population is to be ensured
by a deeply rooted risk culture, nurtured by effective awareness raising.
