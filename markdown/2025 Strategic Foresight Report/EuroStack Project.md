feedback: 'Europe''s future hinges on its digital resilience, and the 2025 Strategic
  Foresight Report presents a crucial opportunity to chart a course toward genuine
  digital sovereignty. The EuroStack Project submits this response, arguing that reliance
  on non-European tech giants poses a significant threat to the EU''s long-term stability
  and competitiveness. This dependence creates strategic and economic vulnerabilities,
  jeopardizes data sovereignty under extraterritorial laws like the US FISA and CLOUD
  Act, and stifles European innovation. A resilient EU in 2040, as envisioned by EuroStack,
  will be characterized by control over its critical digital infrastructure a "EuroStack"
  built upon enforceable open standards and Open Source software. This will empower
  a thriving ecosystem of European businesses, especially SMEs, fueled by secure,
  interoperable data sharing and a highly skilled workforce. Achieving this vision
  requires a radical shift: prioritizing Open Source in all publicly funded projects
  ("Public Money, Public Code"), including public procurement of digital solutions
  ("Open Source First"), and enforcing interoperability to prevent vendor lock-in.
  This should extend to the creation of a "European Small Business Act" that favors
  European SMEs in public procurement. Crucially, building the EuroStack should be
  a bottom-up effort, leveraging existing, proven European Open Source technologies.
  Beyond infrastructure, digital resilience demands a holistic approach encompassing
  digital inclusion for all citizens, ethical AI development, and citizen empowerment
  through data control. Sustainable financing models, where users directly contract
  with developers of EuroStack components, will ensure long-term viability. The Commission''s
  strategic foresight can be enhanced by embracing Open Source intelligence, actively
  engaging with the Open Source community, and prioritizing bottom-up, community-driven
  initiatives like EuroStack. The synergies between digital sovereignty, economic
  competitiveness, and cybersecurity are clear. While short-term cost concerns may
  seem to conflict with long-term sovereignty investments, this is a false economy.
  The long-term risks of dependence far outweigh any perceived short-term savings.
  Europe has the strength in its values, a vibrant Open Source community and tech
  ecosystem, and regulation such as the GDPR. By prioritizing true European solutions,
  the EU can secure not only its digital future, but its overall resilience and global
  leadership.'

  Open Source First stack, SME-led procurement and explicitly rejects hyperscaler-led
  models like the current Gaia‑X approach. There are also different emphases on governance
  trade-offs — centralised enforcement and large pan‑EU facilities versus decentralized
  community-driven development and market-based financing for open-source components.'

# **EuroStack Project Response to the Call for Evidence** **"2025 Strategic Foresight Report"**


[Author: Stefane Fermigier (sf@fermigier.com)](mailto:sf@fermigier.com)
Date: 25 Feb. 2025
Version: 1.0


To the Secretariat-General of the European Commission,


This submission provides evidence-based input to the 2025 Strategic Foresight Report, focusing on long[term EU resilience, from the perspective of the EuroStack Project (https://euro-stack.com). We believe](https://euro-stack.com/)
that achieving genuine digital sovereignty, built upon Open Source principles and a thriving European
ecosystem, is _essential_ for overall EU resilience. Our response is structured around the key questions
[posed in the Call for Evidence, drawing upon the comprehensive EuroStack Vision](https://euro-stack.com/pages/vision) [and Manifesto.](https://euro-stack.com/pages/manifesto)

## **1. Scope: Main Challenges and Strengths for Long-Term EU** **Resilience**

### **Main Challenges**


**Over-Reliance on Non-European Tech Giants:** The dominance of non-European hyperscalers in
cloud computing, data infrastructure, and digital platforms represents a critical vulnerability. This
reliance creates economic dependence, risks data sovereignty (due to extraterritorial laws like the US
FISA or CLOUD Act), undermines European competitiveness, and limits Europe's ability to shape its
digital future according to its values. The failure of Gaia-X exemplifies the dangers of a flawed
approach to addressing this challenge.

**Fragmented Digital Ecosystem:** A lack of cohesive, interoperable European digital infrastructure
hinders innovation, collaboration, and the ability of European businesses, particularly SMEs, to
compete globally.


**Cybersecurity Threats:** The increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, including those
targeting critical infrastructure, pose a significant threat to EU resilience. A reliance on proprietary,
closed-source systems exacerbates these risks due to limited transparency and auditability.

**Skills Gap:** A shortage of skilled professionals in areas like open-source technologies, cloud
computing, and cybersecurity hinders the development and deployment of sovereign digital solutions.

**Lack of Strategic Investment:** Insufficient and strategically misdirected investment in Europeangrown open-source technologies and SMEs limits the growth of a competitive and resilient digital
ecosystem.

### **Strengths**


**Strong European Values:** The EU's commitment to democracy, privacy, transparency, and inclusivity
provides a solid ethical foundation for building a resilient digital future.

**Vibrant Open Source Community:** Europe has a thriving Open Source community and a growing
number of innovative SMEs developing sovereign digital solutions.

**World-Leading Research and Innovation:** European research institutions and universities are at the
forefront of many key technologies, providing a strong basis for building indigenous capabilities.


**Regulatory Framework (GDPR):** The GDPR provides a strong framework for data protection and
serves as a model for other regions.

**Growing Awareness of Digital Sovereignty:** There is increasing awareness among policymakers
and businesses of the importance of digital sovereignty for long-term resilience.

## **2. Imagine 2040: A Resilient EU in 2040**


A resilient EU in 2040 would be characterized by:


**Digital Sovereignty:** Control over its critical digital infrastructure, including cloud computing, data
centers, identity systems, and payment systems, all built upon a foundation of open standards and
Open Source software (the "EuroStack"). This reduces reliance on non-European providers and
ensures that European data is governed by European laws and values.

**Thriving Digital Ecosystem:** A robust, competitive, and innovative ecosystem of European
businesses, particularly SMEs, providing a diverse range of digital solutions. Public procurement
policies actively favor these businesses and open-source projects.

**Data-Driven Innovation:** Secure and interoperable data sharing frameworks enable data-driven
innovation across all sectors, while respecting privacy and data sovereignty.

**Cyber-Resilient Infrastructure:** Digital infrastructure is designed and operated with security as a
core principle, leveraging the transparency and auditability of open source to mitigate cyber threats. A
Zero Trust Architecture is the default.


**Skilled Workforce:** A highly skilled workforce, equipped with the knowledge and expertise to develop,
deploy, and maintain sovereign digital solutions. Open Source technologies are a core component of
education and training at all levels.

**Sustainable Digital Infrastructure:** Digital infrastructure is designed and operated with a focus on
energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, contributing to the EU's climate goals.

## **3. Society and Generations: Ensuring a Resilient Society and** **Fairness**


**Digital Inclusion:** Ensure access to digital technologies and opportunities for all citizens, regardless
of their location, background, gender, or socioeconomic status. This includes bridging the digital divide
and promoting digital literacy.

**Ethical AI:** Develop and deploy AI systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable, adhering to
European ethical standards.

**Data Empowerment:** Give citizens control over their own data, fostering trust and enabling new datadriven business models that benefit individuals and society.

**Intergenerational Fairness:** Ensure that the benefits of digital transformation are shared equitably
across generations, avoiding the creation of new inequalities.

## **4. Long-Term Resilience: Critical Policy Actions**


**Prioritize Open Source:** Adopt an " **Open Source First** " policy for all publicly funded software
projects ("Public Money, Public Code"), including **procurement** of digital solutions for the public sector
in Europe. This will foster innovation, reduce vendor lock-in, enhance cybersecurity, and promote a
vibrant European open-source ecosystem.

**Enforce Interoperability:** To prevent vendor lock-in, mandate open standards for data formats, APIs,
and communication protocols to ensure seamless integration and data exchange across systems and


sectors. Ensure that compliance with these standards is rigorously monitored and enforced, with clear
penalties for non-compliance (for dominant players), to create a level playing field for all actors.

**Invest in European SMEs:** Create a "European Small Business Act" that reserves a significant
portion of public procurement for European SMEs and provides them with the necessary support to
compete with global players.

**Build the EuroStack:** Invest in and promote the development of a modular, scalable, interoperable,
and Open Source-based digital infrastructure (the "EuroStack") built upon existing European solutions.
This is a _bottom-up_ approach, focused on identifying, promoting, integrating, and supporting existing
European open-source technologies.

**Strengthen Cybersecurity:** Invest in cybersecurity research and development, promote the adoption
of secure coding practices, and establish clear incident response plans.

**Develop Digital Skills:** Prioritize digital skills training, focusing on open-source technologies, cloud
computing, and cybersecurity.

**Sustainable Financing:** Implement funding models where users of EuroStack components directly
contract with the entities responsible for their development and maintenance.


**Reform or Replace Gaia-X** : The current Gaia-X initiative, due to structural flaws and the undue
influence of hyperscalers, is unsalvageable. It should be either fundamentally reformed to remove
conflicted interests and prioritize genuinely European, Open Source solutions, or abandoned in favor
of a new initiative built from the ground up on the principles of the EuroStack.

## **5. Synergies and Tensions**


**Synergy:** Digital sovereignty and economic competitiveness are mutually reinforcing. A strong
European digital ecosystem will create jobs, drive innovation, and enhance the EU's global
competitiveness.

**Synergy:** Open source and cybersecurity are closely linked. The transparency and auditability of open
source enhance security and reduce the risk of hidden vulnerabilities.

**Tension:** Short-term cost considerations may conflict with the long-term benefits of investing in
sovereign digital solutions. However, this is a false economy; the long-term costs of dependence on
non-European providers (economic vulnerability, data insecurity, lack of control) far outweigh the
short-term savings.

**Tension:** The desire for rapid deployment of new technologies may clash with the need for thorough
security and ethical assessments. A balance must be struck, prioritizing security and ethical
considerations without unduly stifling innovation. The use of open source and open standards
facilitates this balance.

## **6. Enhancing Strategic Foresight**


The European Commission could enhance its strategic foresight by:


**Embracing Open Source Intelligence (OSINT):** Leveraging the vast amount of publicly available
information on open-source technologies, market trends, and cybersecurity threats.

**Engaging with the Open Source Community:** Actively engaging with the European open-source
community to gather insights and expertise.

**Developing Scenario Planning Capabilities:** Using scenario planning to explore a range of possible
futures and assess the resilience of different policy options.

**Establishing a Dedicated Foresight Unit:** Creating a dedicated unit within the Commission with the
expertise and resources to conduct ongoing foresight activities.


**Prioritizing Bottom-Up Initiatives:** Recognize and support bottom-up, community-driven initiatives
like the EuroStack, which are often more agile and innovative than top-down approaches.


The EuroStack Project believes that a strong commitment to digital sovereignty, built upon Open Source
principles and a thriving European ecosystem, is essential for the EU's long-term resilience. We urge the
Commission to consider these recommendations in the development of the 2025 Strategic Foresight
Report. We are ready to provide further input and collaborate with the Commission on this critical issue.


Sincerely,


Stefane Fermigier
On behalf of the EuroStack Project
