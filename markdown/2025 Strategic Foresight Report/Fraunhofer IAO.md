feedback: 'Re: Long-term resilience | Quantum computing has attracted a great deal
  of interest in recent years due to its disruptive potential to solve problems that
  cannot, or only to a limited extent, be solved with conventional computer architectures.
  Against this backdrop, an international innovation ecosystem is emerging in which
  players from research, industry and politics are working together to generate knowledge
  and innovations. In order to identify concrete starting points for strengthening
  and further developing the quantum computing ecosystem, this study interviewed 34
  leading international experts in quantum computing from the fields of science, business,
  and politics. The study shows that in addition to technological advances, structural
  issues such as long-term funding, the availability of skilled workers, and the development
  of expertise in industry are essential. It also highlights the importance of international
  cooperation and a less bureaucratic regulatory framework to foster the quantum computing
  ecosystem. Link to study: https://doi.org/10.24406/publica-3632'

llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise strengthening Europe’s emerging-technology
  ecosystems through sustained, long-term investment, development of specialised workforce
  and industry expertise, and enhanced international cooperation. They also converge
  on the need to reform structural and administrative barriers (funding mechanisms,
  procurement and translational pathways) so research more readily converts into commercial
  and strategic capabilities.
llm_disagreements: 'They differ on regulatory posture and breadth of concerns: one
  submission emphasises stronger enforcement, precautionary governance, democratic
  oversight and attention to societal risks (e.g., biosecurity, mental health, climate
  interventions), while the other calls for a less bureaucratic regulatory framework
  to accelerate innovation. The first advances a broad, cross-sector resilience agenda
  (climate, biotech, SRM, AI, foresight) whereas the second focuses narrowly on structural
  enablers for the quantum computing ecosystem.'
