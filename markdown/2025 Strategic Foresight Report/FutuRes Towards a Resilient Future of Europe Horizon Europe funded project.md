feedback: 'A main challenge for EU policy is demographic resilience. More specifically,
  it is the way that demographic change transforms the basis on which pension systems,
  the labour market, or networks of care were built. When a crisis or shock hits,
  these systems come under pressure, as we have seen during the Covid-pandemic. Europe
  must be able to withstand further crises of comparable dimensions in the future.
  For this, European policies need to ensure enough skilled workers enter in its critical
  jobs (health, mobility, administration, etc.), as well as an availability of enough
  carers (family caregivers, neighborhood help, volunteers, etc.). The following are
  findings from the EU-funded FutuRes research project and Policy Lab. A demographically
  resilient EU in 2040 would be one in which: accessibility to the labour market is
  much improved for younger people, older people, women and groups with disadvantages
  the financial disadvantages of family caregiving and childrearing are removed: people
  who take time off or work part time in order to care no longer pay for this with
  lower pensions local communities act as pillars of care and cohesion: instead of
  leaving the task of caring for older people and children on the shoulders of fewer
  and fewer blood-relatives, the local level is empowered to improve neighborhood
  and community support. institutions regularly engage in latest foresight methods
  What needs to be done today to strengthen resilience in the EU by 2040: 1. Make
  labour markets resilient: o Explore migration and automation as options, but do
  not overly rely on them o Focus on increasing the labour market participation rate
  o Make critical jobs more attractive For more detail on these recommendations see:
  https://population-europe.eu/research/policy-insights/skills-shortage-eu-ways-towards-labour-market-resilience
  2. Empower local communities: o Advance the local care sector: make it an attractive
  option in the labour market o Show accountability, build trust, prevent polarisation
  o Create a local demographic strategy o In case of depopulation: identify the drivers
  to counter effectively For practice examples of these recommendations see: https://population-europe.eu/research/policy-insights/manage-demographic-change-locally-what-regions-and-municipalities-can-do
  3. Exercise foresight on all levels: Every institutional level profits from data-driven,
  science-based foresight. Foresight increases resilience and cost-effectiveness in
  the case of a crisis. Four building blocks can be combined according to needs. See:

llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritize strengthening EU long-term resilience
  through improved strategic foresight, evidence-driven policymaking, and attention
  to intergenerational fairness. They converge on the need to bolster social cohesion
  and human capital—including making labour markets and talent retention more effective—and
  to empower local communities and participatory processes to increase societal resilience.
llm_disagreements: 'They diverge on primary policy focus and instruments: one submission
  concentrates on emerging-technology governance, climate intervention preparedness
  (including SRM), biosecurity, defence/tech sovereignty, and centralized enforcement
  and R&D institutions; the other centers on demographic resilience, labour market
  participation, caregiving, pensions, and locally driven care and community strategies.
  They also differ in preferred levers — large-scale, mission-driven R&D/procurement
  and centralized agencies versus local demographic strategies, labour-market reforms,
  and community-level interventions.'
