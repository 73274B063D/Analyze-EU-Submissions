Over the last few years, the links between the environment
and health have become increasingly well researched and
understood, so much so that they are playing a growing role
in public debate. However, the approach to these issues is still
relatively fragmented. While chemical pollution (such as
pesticides, endocrine disruptors and other “forever” pollutants)
has received extensive media coverage in recent months, and
the damage to health caused by air pollution is now widely
known, most of the links between ecology and health remain
under-reported, and many issues are still flying under the radar.



This is the case, for example, with the increase in emerging
infectious diseases, a consequence, among other things, of
global warming and the loss of biodiversity worldwide, despite
the fact that many scientists have begun to sound the alert on
this issue. Is anyone aware that every year in France, between
1 June and 15 September, 33,000 deaths can be directly
attributed to heat? The same is true of the widespread mental
health crisis we are experiencing and its links to the current
climate situation and the increase in chemical pollution,
which are increasingly well documented.

As the leading mutual health and social protection group,
Groupe VYV is deeply moved by such examples, which call for
a radical change of approach: if we want to be able to respond
sustainably to the health challenges posed by humanity’s
transition into an era of uncertainty and ecological shifts,
we need collectively to move away from the model of a welfare
society that merely anticipates and prepares for new risks.

Thinking in the long term to provide better protection today:
this is the ambitious aim that Groupe VYV must pursue. By
willingly anticipating uncertain futures, we need to broaden
what we consider possible and fully appreciate the socioecological risks and challenges to health, social protection
and our organisation. This awareness, far from leading us to
turn in on ourselves, should open us up to new positions and
enable us to continue to assume our role as a major player
in social and ecological protection in the 21 [st] century.

Analysis of each of them shows that exposure to major vulnerabilities is
likely to be relatively consistent across regions in the coming years, and
every social group will be affected. We will all undoubtedly be affected
by various risks such as worsening climatic conditions, new diseases,
submersion and coastal erosion, regardless of our socio-professional
category, geographical location or gender. However, sensitivity to these
risks (i.e. the ability to cope with them and deal with their consequences)
will probably continue to be distributed unevenly across social groups,
thus causing an increase in health inequalities in the coming decades. For
those involved in health and social protection, this observation is a major
challenge and translates into a twofold requirement: better protecting
people through all the factors that determine health (food, housing,
physical activity, etc.), but also guaranteeing access and quality coverage
for as many people as possible, including the most disadvantaged
(unemployed people, migrants, residents of working-class neighbourhoods
or rural areas less well served by healthcare providers, etc.).

Therefore, this document encourages these health and social protection
stakeholders to consider new, particularly radical and ambitious
approaches to meet these health, social and democratic needs. What if,
in the future, these stakeholders helped to build a new social security
system for food? To rid their regions of pollution. To offer microcredit
solutions to certain marginalised populations? To re-wild urban and rural
spaces? To manufacture medicines on French soil? To build a health service
adapted to the challenges of eco-anxiety [3] ? To enable everyone to
proactively move to areas less exposed to certain risks? Looking beyond
the question of their feasibility, these approaches point to new possible
positions for stakeholders in the sector who would like to contribute
differently to protecting people’s health: participating in the adaptation
and dissemination of health-related information, offering healthcare and
insurance adapted to the conditions associated with the new ecological
era, becoming the driving force behind local solidarity and democracy,
improving the liveability and health of the regions, participating in the
relocation of people and activities to more protected areas, etc. All these
new areas of action must be seized by the stakeholders, not alone but with
others, through strategies of influence and alliances contributing to the
necessary transformation of social protection.

### INTRODUCTION

and the worsening of people's mental health.


in the nature, scale and profile of the victims of the health vulnerabilities
that threaten us today. In fact, in a given climate situation, the health of a
population will be impacted differently depending on whether its
agricultural model is ecological or industrial, whether its urban planning
is essentially mineral or green, or whether its health system is universal
and functional or selective and run down.

Our task, therefore, is to analyse varied trends for our societies in order to
anticipate a wide spectrum of possible socio-ecological and health
situations. It is with this in mind that foresight ( _la prospective_ ) has come to
the fore, an ancient discipline that is once again attracting interest in a
global situation characterised by multiple, simultaneous and
interconnected crises (climate, demographic, geo-strategic and energy
crises). Based on the creation of scenarios that break with a linear logic,
it is now proving crucial in helping us answer the question that we must
face: _**“Will we all be vulnerable in the future? In 2040, what socio-ecological**_
_**risks, what impact on health and its determining factors and what role for**_
_**health and social protection stakeholders?”**_

WILL WE ALL BE VULNERABLE IN THE FUTURE? **/FORESIGHT REPORT/** DECEMBER 2024 **9**


The purpose of this document is to present the results of a foresight study
based on this issue (the methodological details of which will be presented
below). In this respect, it follows on from a first volume devoted to the
environmental risks _already_ weighing on our societies and, more
generally, reflects a desire to conduct long-term reflection on foresight
within Groupe VYV.

This second volume, which aims to take a long-term view, is divided into
three parts. The first part presents future scenarios encouraging us to
broaden our visions of the future, from which health vulnerabilities and
the challenges they pose emerge, as identified in the second part. The
third and final part, meanwhile, outlines possible answers through new
positions to better manage these issues collectively.

We hope that the following pages will convince you of the need to think
about tomorrow’s risks today, as the surest way to protect ourselves
collectively and sustainably by preparing for action. We hope you enjoy
reading it.

**16** WILL WE ALL BE VULNERABLE IN THE FUTURE? **/FORESIGHT REPORT/** DECEMBER 2024


#### **Why these scenarios?**

As explained previously, these scenarios make it possible to study health
vulnerabilities that have not yet been studied in depth. They have therefore
been designed with a view to raising questions to reveal these
vulnerabilities, key among which are as follows.


New Green Deal Scenario

Now supported by a broad swathe of the political spectrum, the proposal
to reindustrialise the French economy is rarely analysed from the
perspective of its potential health consequences. However, the harmful
effects of industrial activities are now well known: various forms of
pollution, risk of accidents (infrastructure and work-related), depletion of
local resources, etc. By hypothesising large-scale reindustrialisation, this
scenario raises a number of questions that remain to this day in the blind
spot of economic and health decision-makers: what would be the hazards
associated with the relocation of certain manufacturing and extraction
capacities? What would be the most affected regions and populations?
What would be the consequences for strenuous labour and the rate of
accidents at work? By outlining what a reorganised region could be like,
based on intensive and local manufacturing and a sharp rise in
employment in the primary and secondary sectors, this scenario highlights
the emergence of risks that are still poorly understood.


Technological Inflation Scenario

In recent years, proposals for responses to current ecological and health
issues have largely revolved around the roll-out of new cutting-edge
technologies: carbon capture and storage techniques, hydrogen-powered
aircraft, statistical monitoring of pandemic risks, digital twin, etc. In these
analyses, little consideration is given to the health consequences of this
large-scale technological roll-out: what are the implications of a
widespread dependence on advanced technologies in healthcare that
depend on flows (of resources, energy, etc.) that can be interrupted at any
time? What vulnerabilities are emerging from an increasingly digitalised
society? What are the physical and mental consequences for populations
(sedentary lifestyle, anxiety, etc.)? How are the risks of industrial accidents
changing as technologies become more complex and ubiquitous? This
scenario allows these questions to be addressed head-on by considering
the possibility of a strong development of advanced technologies against
a backdrop of intensification of current economic trends (growth,
globalisation, inequalities, etc.). It thus makes it possible to take a step
back and critically analyse these health issues, which have not yet been
studied in depth.



**18** WILL WE ALL BE VULNERABLE IN THE FUTURE? **/FORESIGHT REPORT/** DECEMBER 2024


The role of diet in people’s health is now widely recognised: a healthy and
varied diet is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. But the food sector is,
more broadly, at the crossroads of many other health-determining factors:
the quantity and quality of the food that ends up on our plates, the working
conditions of farmers, the quantity of chemicals resulting from one
production method rather than another (industrial or small-scale), the
use of land that promotes or hinders the flourishing of rich biodiversity,
etc. While food is often the focus of discussions about health, the food
system as a whole is rarely considered from a health perspective. This
scenario, based on the hypothesis of a radical transformation in our food
production methods coupled with a renewal of local democratic practices
and a transition to frugality, makes it possible to do just that. In doing so,
it raises many public health issues: what are the impacts on occupational
health (agricultural and industrial) of reducing the use of advanced
technologies (and in particular industrial farming)? How are regional
inequalities in health evolving against a backdrop of reduced regional
trade? What are the health risks posed by a reduction in the amount of
built-up land in favour of a return to nature? These questions, in turn,
reveal health vulnerabilities that are still largely overlooked.


The health consequences of ecological disruption are now increasingly
well known: hyperthermia, new infectious and chronic diseases, disasters,
etc. On the other hand, the health consequences of the political and
geographical upheavals that these disruptions could cause have not been
studied in depth. To remedy this, this scenario is anchored in the hypothesis
of a rapid and widespread intensification of ecological risks. In doing so,
it addresses issues related to the uninhabitability of regions (which regions
will be concerned? How to deal with the resulting forced displacement?
What will be the health issues specific to displaced populations? And what
will be the consequences of enforced frugality due to multiple ecological
crises?) But also those related to the rise to power of a reactionary
government (what will be the consequences of the State's disengagement
in certain places and for certain people? Who will be the first to be
affected by this disengagement, in what way, and how can the continuity
of their care be ensured? How can we prevent the rise of tensions between
individuals against a backdrop of increasingly scarce resources, shortages
and growing inequalities? How can we address the psychological
consequences of such social disintegration? These questions all constitute
blind spots in health discussions on the adaptation of populations to
ongoing ecological disasters, which result in various vulnerabilities.

### OUR VULNERABILITIES IN 2040: COMMON LESSONS AND CHALLENGES

Once established, our four future scenarios revealed a wide
variety of socio-ecological health vulnerabilities. These have
been grouped together in an attempt to answer the foresight
question “Will we all be vulnerable in the future?” Particular
attention has therefore been paid to analysing the distribution
of health vulnerabilities and their impacts, and this has made
it possible to identify a number of challenges for those involved
in health and social protection.

#### **Six major vulnerabilities** **identified for population groups**


The socio-ecological vulnerabilities revealed by our different scenarios
can be grouped into 6 major vulnerabilities, themselves belonging to two
major trends.

The first consists of an alteration of the ecological situation and includes
three major vulnerabilities. The first relates to exposure to hazardous
(extra)ordinary climatic conditions (heat waves, new humidity conditions,
extreme events, less marked differences between seasons). The second
concerns the multiplication of external aggressions (pollution, disruption,
etc.). The third, finally, lies in the emergence of new infectious diseases
(new pathogens, pandemics, Lyme disease, etc.). Overall, the imbalance
in our natural environments is thus causing a form of gradual shrinkage
of habitable and healthy regions.

The second trend is our changing lifestyles, characterised by three other
major vulnerabilities. On the one hand, the new rise of more strenuous
ways of working (agriculture, industry, outdoor work, etc.). On the other
hand, an erosion of traditional community solidarity (withdrawal into
oneself, sluggish growth affecting the health system, new competition for
resources, etc.). Finally, a creeping insecurity in society (inflation, enforced
frugality, supply disruptions). Combined, these vulnerabilities generate a
progressive loss of the capacity to protect oneself against the effects of
the deteriorating ecological situation.


**22** WILL WE ALL BE VULNERABLE IN THE FUTURE? **/FORESIGHT REPORT/** DECEMBER 2024


A number of the vulnerabilities arising from our future scenarios are
evidence of the upheaval of a global ecological situation that was
previously relatively stable.

To date, the most well-known of these changes are linked to the profound
destabilisation of the global climate caused by the intensification of human
activities since the industrial era, and particularly over the last few
decades. These destabilising factors will have various manifestations, many
of which can already be seen today: an increase in episodes of extreme
heat, droughts and fires, floods and submersion, increasingly frequent
and violent storms, etc. Although the risks associated with these
destabilising factors are present in our various scenarios, their severity in
the coming years will depend on many factors: our collective ability to
reduce the ecological impact of human activity, the roll-out (or not) of
climate engineering experiments aimed at deliberately manipulating the
global climate, and the level of preparedness of cities, housing and regions.
Against this background, population groups will be affected in the same
way. First of all because some regions are more exposed than others, such
as coastal areas (facing flooding), southern regions (facing rising
temperatures), and the most arid areas (facing droughts and fires).
Secondly, because people do not have the same material and financial
ability to adapt to this situation. Thus, while some social groups have the
means to finance alterations to their homes (air conditioning, thermal
renovation, etc.) or even to move house, others will have no choice but to
endure the hazards in a home that cannot protect them.

A final type of health vulnerability linked to ecological destabilisation
concerns the increase in the spread of infectious diseases. These may
already exist (experiencing a resurgence or increase), may be new or may
have been previously absent from France. There are many reasons for
their emergence, some of which are directly linked to the global increase
in temperatures, which leads certain disease-carrying species (such as
mosquitoes and ticks) to move into new regions. Still others are linked to
the massive loss of biodiversity worldwide, which favours the proliferation
of vector species (due to the disappearance of their predators) and thus
increases the likelihood of contact between infected individuals and
humans [20] . Brought to the attention of the general public during the
Covid-19 pandemic, these diseases that can be transmitted from animals
to humans, known as zoonoses, constitute a growing health risk for all
populations. The WHO estimates that they are responsible for
700,000 deaths per year worldwide, a figure that is expected to increase
as global ecological imbalances continue. However, there are disparities
between social groups in their ability to protect themselves (access to
vaccines, purchase of suitable clothing, etc.) and to deal with the
consequences (access to healthcare, sufficiently early diagnosis, access
to expensive treatments, etc.).



In 2023, in France, there were
###### **2,019 cases of Dengue,** 30 cases of Chikungunya and 9 cases of Zika, diseases that

had been virtually absent from
France until then [21] .



**Zoonoses** (diseases that can
be transmitted from animals to
humans) are estimated to be
responsible for more than
###### **2 billion infections**

each year [23] .

and decline of collective protection
mechanisms

This other category of major vulnerabilities is related to profound changes
in our lifestyles, which have their origins in fundamental social and
ecological trends that are likely to intensify in the coming years.

The first of these changes concerns the changes in our ways of working
resulting from the new global ecological and political situation. These can
range from a massive relocation of the extraction and manufacturing
industries to a transition towards forms of frugality that severely limit the
use of advanced technologies. Both of these possibilities respond to various
imperatives, and in particular to the need to reduce national dependence
on globalised value chains (and therefore vulnerable to ecological and
geopolitical disruptions), as well as to that of a drastic reduction in the
socio-ecological impacts of the French economy (greenhouse gas
emissions, pollution, waste, etc.). While they are a desirable trend in many
ways, their health consequences should not be underestimated. The
relocation of manufacturing necessarily implies a strengthening of the
primary (extraction) and secondary (processing) sectors, which is likely to
increase the risk of workplace accidents and chronic illnesses related to
the strenuous nature of the work. The path of frugality amplifies these risks
through the generalised reduction in the use of machinery in many
industries and, in particular, in the agricultural sector, which would see a
sharp increase in its labour needs. In both cases (which may overlap),
there are numerous health risks: musculoskeletal, respiratory and
cardiovascular disorders, occupational accidents, etc. While those already
working in the industrial and extraction sectors (in which underprivileged
and migrant populations are currently over-represented) will probably
be the first to be affected, some forecasts predict a generalisation of
manual labour that could expose populations currently unexposed to
these risks.

has the consequence of leaving a growing part of the population without
a safety net when faced with the hazards of everyday life. While the most
vulnerable populations (people excluded from employment, migrants,
underprivileged social classes) will be the first to be affected, this situation
will undoubtedly have consequences in the long term for public health as
a whole. Indeed, despite the currently limited nature of this erosion, it may
gradually become more widespread, threatening the stability of the
healthcare and welfare system as a whole. Moreover, the health conditions
of the different social groups are not isolated, but are interconnected. This
is evidenced by the abolition of state medical aid, the health consequences
of which would affect the entire population, and not only the populations
directly concerned [30] .

2022 about **the advanced**

In 2021, the French Health

One last vulnerability, finally, concerns the increasing difficulty, for many
people, to meet their basic needs for material and financial reasons. This
situation of enforced frugality is already having health consequences
(malnutrition, difficulty accessing healthcare, stress, etc.) for many people,
particularly among underprivileged or migrant populations. It is also likely
to intensify over the next few years, for several reasons: ecological reasons,
such as the destruction of production infrastructure due to weather
hazards, increased soil degradation that impacts food production and
the rapid depletion of resources (raw materials, water, etc.), and economic
and social reasons (supply disruptions, inflation, reduction in imports,
power cuts, etc.). Thus, over time, people who have been spared the effects
of this trend until now may suffer the health repercussions. This is
evidenced, for example, by the sharp increase in the use of food assistance
mechanisms in recent years by people who were previously not exposed
to food insecurity [36] . Residents of large cities, which are highly dependent
on just-in-time supplies (of food, energy, etc.), and people dependent on
continuous healthcare and the importing of vital medicines are also likely
to be among the first affected.

widespread exposure to hazards of a socio-ecological nature, regardless
of the socio-professional category, geographical location or even the
gender of the populations concerned. However, this increase will take
different forms and intensities depending on the situation: while some will
see their living environment more exposed to extreme weather events,
others will be more affected by an increase in the strenuousness of their
work or by growing difficulty in meeting their basic needs: food, access to
healthcare, etc.

Then, beyond this widespread exposure, existing health inequalities seem
to be intensifying due to differences in the material and financial abilities
to deal with these new risks. Thus, while some of the more affluent members
of the population will have little difficulty, at least initially, in adapting their
homes to a new ecological situation, or even in moving, others will be
forced to remain in housing that is unable to protect them. The same
applies to protection against the increasing number of disruptions and
pollutions, against which some populations will be largely defenceless
while others will benefit from sufficiently early diagnoses, access to
appropriate treatments and the ability to change their living environment
(work, neighbourhood, region, etc.).

These considerations echo the definition of vulnerability given by the
economist specialising in health and environmental issues, Éloi Laurent,
for whom vulnerability is a result of the interaction between two variables:


#### **stakeholders**

The worsening of the health vulnerabilities described so far poses a
number of challenges for those involved in health and social protection,
which can be categorised according to the needs they address.

The first category includes the set of challenges that relate to people’s
physical and mental health needs when faced with various threats. These
challenges relate to increased exposure to weather hazards, industrial
hazards and pollution, the growing threat of infectious diseases that are
emerging, resurging or increasing in areas previously unaffected, the
improvement or maintenance of healthcare, the maintenance of decent
working conditions, or the adoption of healthy lifestyles in environments
that make this increasingly difficult.

A second category covers the support of social needs. These challenges
stem from the need to meet the basic requirements of the population
against a backdrop of uncertainty and loss of social ties: protecting climate
migrants and the unemployed, guaranteeing access to basic necessities,
guaranteeing universal access to healthy food, rebuilding strained social
relations, etc. They may also be related to a need to support the adaptation
of the economy to this new socio-ecological situation, in particular through
support for businesses and public authorities, the development of
individual cross-disciplinary skills, and the protection of essential sectors
of the economy in the event of technical interruption.

The third category, meanwhile, responds to democratic needs: against the
backdrop of a growing authoritarian tendency, the challenges classified
here aim to preserve forms of collective decision-making. These can apply
to business management, the allocation of strenuous jobs, the organisation
of regions or the use of scarce resources that are the subject of conflicts
over their use.

Finally, the last category brings together the challenges addressing the
needs of the social protection system against a backdrop that puts it under
increasing pressure every day: slowing economic growth, growing
ecological and health crises, accelerated population ageing, etc. The aim
of these challenges is to support its transition to a more stable, resilient
and accessible system for the entire population.

These challenges now constitute areas for consideration with a view to the
emergence of new proposals from those involved in health and social
protection with regard to increasingly vulnerable populations. As a result,
they give rise to a number of possible responses and positions for these
stakeholders, which will be set out in detail in part 3.

### INITIAL LINES OF RESPONSE AND ADAPTATION

After identifying priority vulnerabilities for individuals and
major challenges for social protection, we will now examine
how we can respond to these issues. Initially, we will report on
certain proposals that have emerged from this foresight study,
which constitute original responses to the vulnerabilities
identified above. In the second phase, we will look at the new
positions outlined by these proposals. **The various options**
**proposed should not be taken as recommendations, but**
**rather as possibilities for consideration by health and social**
**protection stakeholders of all kinds.** The aim here is not,
therefore, to assess their feasibility or economic potential,
but simply to consider the new opportunities that these
possibilities open up.

#### **_What if in the future...?_** **Ambitious new ways to** **expand social protection**


Work has been carried out to devise solutions to better protect people
and offer quality coverage to populations affected. Here we deliberately
explore “avenues” that are particularly “disruptive”.


In response to the challenge of healthy food that is produced and
distributed in a virtuous manner and accessible to as many people as
possible, mutual food assistance schemes seem to be a promising idea.
Building on several experiments, such an initiative would make it possible
to act on the health-determining factors of food both on the production
side, by selecting and supporting producers who respect certain social
and ecological standards, and on the consumption side, by promoting
access to these products for people in financial difficulty.


The issue of access to medicines and medical devices against the backdrop
of an increasingly unstable supply may also be the subject of disruptive
proposals from supplementary health insurance providers. In particular,
the latter could address the pressing issue of relocating all or part of their
production, for example by providing support for the opening of new
production channels, including in the form of cooperatives. In doing so,
they could support the transition to a more frugal and sustainable supply,
while promoting better uses and recycling practices.

of health-promoting projects.


services and providing appropriate advice.


Currently largely confined to a preventive role in health and the
environment, health stakeholders could, in the future, take on a much more
active role in the maintenance of the living environments on which the
health of populations depends. The funding, participation and even
organisation of clean-up operations in certain environments could be
considered.


WILL WE ALL BE VULNERABLE IN THE FUTURE? **/FORESIGHT REPORT/** DECEMBER 2024 **39**


nature, could play a key role in maintaining food security at a regional
level by leveraging land in the regions to promote an increase in production
capacity. To this end, land already owned could be reused and new
investments could be directed towards land already being used or to be
redeveloped.


Similarly to the previous proposal, the land owned by all public and private
organisations could be used for the roll-out of renewable energies and
the creation of areas for the reintroduction and free evolution of
biodiversity. In doing so, they could play a key role in the local
implementation of national ecological strategic plans, such as the ZAN [41]
law and the national Biodiversity and Low Carbon strategies, by giving
them a health focus that is currently lacking.

**40** WILL WE ALL BE VULNERABLE IN THE FUTURE? **/FORESIGHT REPORT/** DECEMBER 2024


Health and social protection stakeholders could also play a central role
in supporting the occupations most exposed to weather hazards by
carrying out preventive actions regarding changes to the resulting health
risks and the behaviours to be adopted as a result. The creation of a
dedicated watchdog has also been raised. Its role would be to monitor
and support occupations undergoing change due to the new ecological
situation, in order to meet the local and specific needs of workers.


The transformation of healthcare practices has been identified as a key
issue in the sector’s adaptation to the new ecological situation, particularly
with regard to the reduction of medication prescriptions (polluting and
resource-intensive) and the shift from a curative approach (treating after
the fact) to a preventive approach. In order to keep pace with these
developments, the health sector could strengthen its support for the
creation and development of community health centres*, i.e. centres based
on the fight against health inequalities and empowerment of patients,
promote integrative health practices (combining conventional and
alternative practices) and design training and prevention content around
these issues.


Faced with the proliferation of external aggressions of an ecological and
health-related nature (extreme weather events, various forms of pollution,
emerging diseases, etc.), the issue of adapting housing is also a central
one. One of the solutions put forward concerns the renovation of
underground spaces owned by stakeholders in the sector: naturally cooler
and more insulated, these could be used as collective living spaces
protected from the elements during events that make outdoor activities
difficult (extreme heat, pollution peaks, etc.).


Finally, to address the rapid decline in the mental health of the population,
particularly in relation to the increased perception of ongoing ecological
damage, health and social protection stakeholders could focus part of
their activity on research and training for professionals in these areas, or
even on the creation of specialised inter-disciplinary care centres.

WILL WE ALL BE VULNERABLE IN THE FUTURE? **/FORESIGHT REPORT/** DECEMBER 2024 **41**


#### **New strategic positions for** **health and social protection** **stakeholders**

As we mentioned earlier, the various options presented previously are not
intended to be integrated into any kind of action plan. Nevertheless, they
give an idea of the range of possibilities available to health and social
protection stakeholders wishing to address the vulnerabilities revealed so
far. In doing so, they provide an opportunity for these stakeholders to
reinvent themselves by adopting new positions. These strategic positions
are now all potential areas of response for current and emerging
professions in the sector.


**1**

PARTICIPATE IN THE ADAPTATION AND SHARING
OF HEALTH KNOWLEDGE


This focus area is an invitation to health and social protection stakeholders
to take an active role in the evolution of health knowledge required in this
era of instability and upheaval. Considering the socio-ecological
disruption described so far, new projects for structuring knowledge on
health and its determinants are opening up: a better understanding of the
ecological, social and economic parameters of the emergence of
epidemics, the links between ecological damage and mental health, the
links between physical, mental and social health, the possible links between
conventional and alternative knowledge, etc. These projects make it
necessary for stakeholders to invest in research and development activities
and to support experimental and interdisciplinary initiatives that are
currently under-promoted.


**2**

OFFER HEALTHCARE AND INSURANCE MORE IN LINE
WITH THE NEW ECOLOGICAL SITUATION


The revival of knowledge in health has led, among other things, to a greater
understanding of the new illnesses that characterise our era: new infectious
diseases, the proliferation of chronic diseases (including in populations
that were previously relatively unaffected) and disorders related to extreme
temperatures, mental and cognitive disorders related to isolation and
anxiety, etc. Faced with these challenges, health and social protection
stakeholders have a major role to play in adapting their healthcare
provision on an ongoing basis and with a view to eco-design [42] : new
insurance policies to protect against the inability to work during heatwaves,
development of healthcare centres adapted to these new illnesses,
production of medicines at risk of supply shortages, etc.



**42** WILL WE ALL BE VULNERABLE IN THE FUTURE? **/FORESIGHT REPORT/** DECEMBER 2024


**3**


that determine their own health, by giving them the means to act under
their own initiative to protect themselves against the vulnerabilities
described above. Health and social protection stakeholders have an active
role to play in this effort by promoting behaviour adapted to these new
risks, providing educational content on the links between ecological
damage and worsening health, taking part in prevention initiatives on
ageing well, etc.


**4**

SUPPORT CHANGES IN THE WORLD OF WORK
AND THE EMERGENCE OF NEW PROFESSIONS


The changes in work described in our approach are expected to be
considerable. They are accompanied by increased and widespread
strenuousness over the next few years: exposure to new pollutants, renewal
of the primary and secondary sectors, increased use of manual labour,
prolonged exposure to weather hazards, etc. But also by the emergence
of new professions and economic sectors dedicated to socio-ecological
risks, as well as the associated training needs. Health and social protection
stakeholders, who are already active in supporting employers and
employees, will be able to take action to minimise the health risks in the
world of work, help to distribute the burden more fairly and support the
emergence of these new professions: by participating in research into
these new ways of working, by supporting career changes in new sectors,
by training for new jobs, by supporting employers, etc.

**5**

FACILITATE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, HOUSING AND
EMPLOYMENT FOR “MARGINALISED” AND FRONTLINE
POPULATIONS


Marginalised populations (climate migrants, long-term unemployed,
homeless people, residents of working-class neighbourhoods, etc.) already
encounter difficulties in satisfying the major health-determining factors
of access to healthcare, housing and employment, and are likely to see
their numbers grow in the coming years. To address this situation, health

**6**

FIGHT AGAINST THE ECONOMIC AND HEALTH INSECURITY
OF AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE BY FACILITATING ACCESS
TO HEALTHCARE AND BASIC NECESSITIES


Purchasing power that is sustainably constrained for a large part of the
population, increasingly frequent supply disruptions and, more generally,
situations of enforced frugality that are on the rise are some of the factors
contributing to a creeping sense of insecurity in society. Health and social
protection stakeholders can help reduce the health consequences of such
a situation by treating it at source, for example by designing the least
expensive supplementary health insurance policies possible, or by
supporting the development of community health centres.


**7**

WORK TOWARDS HEALTHY FOOD FOR HUMANS
(CONSUMERS AND FARMERS), ANIMALS AND ECOSYSTEMS


Diet is a major health-determining factor, the quality of which offers
stakeholders in the health and social protection sectors the opportunity
to position themselves at several levels: production, to support the
development of healthy and sustainable agriculture according to socioecological criteria, and consumption, to promote access to high-quality
food for all. Various courses of action are emerging: the development of
healthcare-food based supplementary health insurance policies,
production channels, the repurchase of farmland, the development of
urban agriculture, the promotion of a less meat-based diet, etc.


**8**

BECOME A DRIVING FORCE FOR LOCAL SOLIDARITY
AND DEMOCRACY


This strategic position recognises the need to support the development of
solidarity mechanisms at the regional level to address the vulnerabilities
described earlier, which cannot be fully addressed by major adaptation
projects. It is thus in direct continuity with the original mutualist spirit, which
is based on collective protection against localised health risks, in a spirit
of collective decision-making and the promotion of a dynamic local
political life. This positioning offers the possibility of a revival of this spirit,
by creating a space for responses that can accommodate a variety of
initiatives, such as partnerships with local authorities for the development
of local social protection, the organisation of democratic decision-making
forums, the management of conflicts over the use of resources, and support
for the adoption of more frugal lifestyles.

### CONCLUSION

The vulnerabilities revealed during this study, as well
as the proposed positioning, outline a new stance for
health and social protection stakeholders, and in
particular mutualist stakeholders: a stance
characterised by the integration of long-term foresight
and the reaffirmation of the need to consider health
in all its social and environmental determining factors.

As such, two approaches to health seem able to serve
as a compass for stakeholders wishing to transform
their practices.

The first is that of planetary health. Theoretical and
experimental development of this approach has been
ongoing for several years. It is based on the
observation (also revealed by our scenarios) that the
progressive deterioration of the world's natural
balances and the accompanying increased
destabilisation of the health of populations have a
common cause: human activities guided by economic
models that are blind to natural limits (to the
exploitation of resources, to the degradation of
environments, etc.). This approach encourages us to
rethink our activities in order to take into account their
ecological and health consequences and to include
actions that promote health as part of a large-scale
socio-ecological transformation target. To this end, the
search for joint environmental and health benefits,
i.e. actions that promote both health and the quality
of living environments (transition to sustainable
mobility, subsidies for the production of healthy food,
etc.), is proving to be a promising and motivating
target. In doing so, the planetary health approach
encourages us to make the link between the health of
individuals and that of their living environments, in
line with the aim of taking the health-determining
factors into account in a comprehensive manner.



The second approach is that of community health.
Based on the principles of health promotion described
by the WHO, the aim is to give people the power to act
on all the factors that determine their health.

Supported by numerous health practitioners and
activists since the 1970s, this approach calls for full
consideration of the links between social inequalities
and health inequalities: unequal exposure to risks,
different ability to face them, unequal access to
information and healthcare, etc. All these factors too
often go unnoticed in public health practices and
policies, and community health calls for them to be
dealt with head-on by involving those most concerned:
the citizens themselves. Numerous “community health
centres” have thus sprung up in recent years to put
these principles into practice, in particular through
the support of people excluded from the healthcare
system through health mediation, the involvement of
patients in the management of healthcare facilities
(presence on the board of directors, organisation of
workshops, etc.) or political advocacy in favour of
better funding for alternative health practices. With
these characteristics, community health now seems to
offer fertile ground for the renewal of social protection

reducing health inequalities.
