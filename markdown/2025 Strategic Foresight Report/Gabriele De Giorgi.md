feedback: My project arises from the need to move beyond the concept of a mere European
  community and toward the creation of a genuine European population, one bound not
  only by shared institutions but also by a deep and authentic sense of belonging.
  This transformation can only be achieved through education, shared values, and widespread
  cultural awareness. A decisive step in this direction would be the introduction
  of European Culture as a mandatory subject in schools across all member states.
  This educational journey, spanning from primary to secondary education, would provide
  young people with the opportunity to explore the history, principles, and extraordinary
  cultural diversity that define Europe. Instead of erasing national identities, this
  initiative would enrich them and transform the European Union from a political abstraction
  into a lived reality. To make this vision concrete, European Culture should become
  an integral part of school curricula, taking the Italian school system as a reference,
  since it is the one I am most familiar with, with one or two hours per week at each
  educational level. In primary school, the approach should be narrative and playful,
  sparking curiosity through stories, games, and activities that introduce children
  to different european cultures and traditions. In lower secondary school, the focus
  should shift to the history of European integration, the functions of its institutions,
  and the key challenges the EU has faced over time. Finally, in upper secondary school,
  students should engage with major global issues impacting the continent, participate
  in decision making simulations, and visit European institutions to gain firsthand
  experience of how the Union operates. To reinforce this awareness, we should also
  symbolically celebrate our common journey by establishing official non working days
  on important historical dates such as 26 March, the anniversary of the Schengen
  Agreement, and 7 February, marking the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. Initially,
  these days would spark curiosity, especially among those unfamiliar with Europe's
  most significant historical milestones. The chance to pause from work and celebrate
  a shared occasion would naturally lead people to question its meaning. Over time,
  these dates would become deeply embedded in collective memory, transforming from
  mere holidays into moments of reflection and unity. They would stand as reminders
  of Europe's journey, ensuring that future generations not only acknowledge these
  milestones but truly understand and cherish their significance. We have before us
  an extraordinary opportunity to transform Europe from an abstract concept into a
  real, lived experience. To build a new generation that no longer questions whether
  they are European but simply knows they are. Today we begin building a Europe of
  Europeans.

llm_agreements: Both submissions endorse strengthening European cohesion through education,
  civic engagement and the promotion of shared democratic values; each stresses the
  importance of engaging young people in shaping Europe’s future. They also align
  on preserving national identities while building stronger pan‑European bonds and
  on using institutional action at EU level to foster solidarity and trust.
llm_disagreements: 'The proposals diverge on priorities and instruments: one focuses
  on technical resilience (AI, biotech, climate security, enforcement, procurement
  reform and large‑scale R&D/infrastructure) and anticipatory governance, while the
  other focuses narrowly on cultural education, curricula and symbolic holidays to
  build identity. They therefore imply different resource allocations and policy pathways—structural,
  regulatory and scientific interventions versus pedagogical and symbolic nation‑building
  measures.'
