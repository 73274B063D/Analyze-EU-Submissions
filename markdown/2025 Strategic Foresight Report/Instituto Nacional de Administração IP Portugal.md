feedback: 'Following our review of the call for evidence, we have reached the following
  conclusions: 1. The document outlines the structure of the 2025 Strategic Foresight
  Report, which follows a similar approach to previous years. This structure appears
  well-suited to addressing the EU''s current and future challenges. 2. The report
  will be anchored in the Competitiveness Compass and the Union of Preparedness Strategy,
  aiming to strengthen the EUs resilience up to 2040. 3. The report will draw upon
  contributions from scientific researchers, academic organizations, learned societies,
  and scientific associations, particularly leveraging published (and pre-published)
  research, scientific analyses, and relevant data. Given the above, we would like
  to explore the possibility of the INA contributing to the reports development with
  relevant studies or papers related to this topic. We could consider sharing insights
  from the Megatrends Report, developed in partnership with REPLAN. Please let us
  know if such a contribution would be of interest and how we might proceed.'

llm_agreements: Both submissions support the 2025 Strategic Foresight Report process
  and its goal of strengthening EU resilience toward 2040, and both value grounding
  the report in evidence and scientific contributions. They concur on the importance
  of linking foresight work to EU strategic frameworks (e.g., Competitiveness Compass
  and preparedness planning) and on engaging research and academic actors in the report’s
  development.
llm_disagreements: Submission A advances detailed policy priorities (e.g., proactive
  governance of emerging technologies, SRM research and governance, biofoundries and
  biosecurity, procurement reform, mental-health-in-all-policies, and strengthened
  enforcement institutions) while Submission B remains process-oriented and offers
  to contribute research without endorsing or addressing those substantive measures.
  Submission B does not take positions on the specific risks, instruments, or regulatory
  reforms emphasised in Submission A, indicating a difference in depth and policy
  ambition.
