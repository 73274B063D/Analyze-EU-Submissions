# **Comments on Strategic Foresight Report 2025**


Ioannis S. Lamprou,


Public Servant, Greece


Developments in recent year (Russian invasion in Ukraine,
instrumentalization of migration, hybrid threat and cyber attacks)
highlighted _security_ as a dimension of paramount importance in the
formulation of EU priorities.


The reluctance of the US administration to continue to contribute with
equal intensity as it did in previous decades to European security, forces
european states to assume more responsibility on defense thus ending the
decades-long geopolitical outsourcing.


Nations-states are faced with _‘long emergencies’_ whose prolonged
duration is significant wider than conventional crisis management. The
responses tο this kind of crises are complex, they evolve as the crises
themselves evolve and aim at building _resilience_ of a society against
everything that upset its daily function. Thus resilience emerges as a
common thread that permeates state apparatus and more generally EU
policy.


I would like to share some thoughts on two thematics, inclusiveness and
resilience.


In relation to the question on how « _could the European Commission_
_further improve its approach to strategic foresight to increase its impact_
_on designing EU policies for a desirable future_ ?» _inclusiveness_ comes up
as an concept of critical signifigance that must be present during designing
an EU policy. Inclusiveness may be approached from more than one angle.
First, inclusiveness can mean accommodating member-states’ legitimate
interests and concerns. For instance the Niinisto Report «Safer Together
Strengthening Europe’s Civilian and Military Preparedness and
Readiness» mentions Russia 131 times as a security concern of EU due to
the latter’s aggression against Ukraine. Yet, Turkey, a country that
occupies, more than fifty years, the northern part of the Republic of Cyprus
features only twice and with no reference as to the invasion of the Republic
of Cyprus in 1974. Integrating the concerns of 27 different states with
different historical experiences and differing perceptions of threat is a
demanding task, nevertheless a necessary one.


In addition, inclusiveness means that strategic foresight approach has to
be open and accessible to society’s participation and offer tangible,
actionable, and impactful policies that ordinary citizens appreciate and see
as pertinent and relevant to their daily lives.


Mobilization of citizens and member state’s public administration
apparatuses will facilitate the acceptance of foresight approach on behalf
of European citizens. Thirdly, as _polycrises_, in terms of interconnected
problems emerge at the same period, multiply affecting every sector of
government, strategic foresight process should embrace a systemic,
integrated view of all services and every aspect of state policy taking into
consideration on how developments on one field expand on another.


Concerning «Which critical policy actions should be initiated today to
strengthen resilience in the EU by 2040?» nurturing a mentality of
resilience in EU member states is of critical importance.


Member states must maintain vital governmental and societal functions in
times of adversity. Thus, citizens' trust in the state is strengthened and
social cohesion is maintained. Enhancing resilience entails regular
assessment of member states’ capabilities and proactive stress-tests of their
long-term policies and strategies against possible future scenarios should
be strongly encouraged taking into consideration the multiple audiences,
different interpretations, languages and cultures of member-states.


The whole-of-government approach to building resilience should not be
guided be a lead EU department but rather take the form of centrally led
collective ownership of planning. The current institutional arrangements
(European Strategy and Policy Analysis System, Strategic Foresight and
Capabilities Unit within the European Parliamentary Research Service)
could be strengthened by setting up a Working Group on Resilience which
will monitor EU policies from the perspective of resilience building. The
Working Group could be integrated in Strategic Foresight and Capabilities
Unit or be incorporated, where applicable, in the workings of European
Parliament’s Committees. Resilience’s inclusion in parliamentary
proceedings will further emphasize the importance of building resilience
in member-states’ democratically elected representatives and consequently
to their societies.


Speaking more broadly on strategic foresight all relevant agencies and
think tanks should form a structured network with defined internal
processes of communication and cooperation so that it can be active and
accessible in the deliberations of EU policies. A coordinating body in the


form of an informal secretariat or Platform can be the unifying element of
this network.
