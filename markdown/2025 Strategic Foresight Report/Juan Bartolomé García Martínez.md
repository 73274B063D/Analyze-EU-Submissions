**ABSTRACT**
Global catastrophic threats to the food system upon which human society depends are numerous.
A nuclear war or volcanic eruption could collapse agricultural yields by inhibiting crop growth.
Nuclear electromagnetic pulses or extreme pandemics could disrupt industry and mass-scale food
supply by unprecedented levels. Global food storage is limited. What can be done?. This article
presents the state of the field on interventions to maintain food production in these scenarios,
aiming to prevent mass starvation and reduce the chance of civilizational collapse and potential
existential catastrophe. The potential for rapid scaling, affordability, and large-scale deployment is
reviewed for a portfolio of food production methods over land, water, and industrial systems.
Special focus is given to proposing avenues for further research and technology development and
to collating policy proposals. Maintaining international trade and prioritizing crops for food instead
of animal feed or biofuels is paramount. Both mature, proven methods (crop relocation, plant-residueand grass–fed ruminants, greenhouses, seaweed, fishing, etc.) and novel resilient foods are
characterized. A future research agenda is outlined, including scenario characterization, policy
development, production ramp-up and economic analyses, and rapid deployment trials. Governments
could implement national plans and task forces to address extreme food system risks, and invest in
resilient food solutions to safeguard citizens against global catastrophic food failure.

**Introduction**

The current global agriculture system heavily depends on
reliable environmental conditions including sunlight, temperature, and precipitation, all of which could be severely
impacted by global catastrophes (Denkenberger and Pearce
2015). It also depends on complex supply chains supported
by a massive global infrastructure, which brings key benefits
but also increases systemic vulnerability, such that a disruption in a given point could affect the entire system (Maynard
2015). Abrupt climate change, crop pathogens, superweeds,
super bacteria, and super crop pests could all severely affect
agriculture (Denkenberger and Pearce 2015). Climate change
is already increasing the likelihood of a multiple breadbasket
failure (Gaupp et al. 2019), and even worse climate change
scenarios are possible (Richards, Gauch, and Allwood 2023).
These are categorized as global catastrophic risks (GCRs),
risks to global well-being potentially imperiling human civilization (Bostrom and Cirkovic 2008), which are severely
underprioritized by governments (Boyd and Wilson 2023b).
However, even worse scenarios are on the table, which could
suddenly upend both the environmental conditions and the



infrastructure on which our global food system depends,
and thus require monumental adaptation efforts to prevent
global famine. The current review focuses primarily on
adaptations to the most extreme global catastrophic food
shock scenarios: an abrupt sunlight reduction scenario
(ASRS), a global catastrophic infrastructure loss (GCIL), and
the worst case: a combination of both.

An ASRS originates from a sudden event that projects
vast amounts of aerosol material such as sulfates or black
carbon (soot) into the stratosphere, where they could become
entrapped for years (Coupe et al. 2019). This is likely to
result in a rapid reduction in sunlight irradiation, which
could cause global temperature, sunlight, and precipitation
levels to fall dramatically, thereby devastating global agricultural production (Xia et al. 2022). The three main avenues
which could lead to an ASRS are: a volcanic winter caused
by a large volcanic eruption, a direct impact of an exceptionally large asteroid or comet, and a nuclear winter triggered by a nuclear war in which numerous cities have been
targeted (Bostrom and Cirkovic 2008; Denkenberger and
Pearce 2015). Models simulating plausible nuclear winter

scenarios with varying degrees of severity estimate a loss of
up to ~90% of global staple crop production in the worst
year of the catastrophe, see Figure 1 (Xia et al. 2022).

GCIL describes a scenario where the electrical grid and/
or industrial infrastructure has been majorly disrupted globally. Since the current agricultural system requires critical
industrial inputs (e.g., processing machines, vehicles, fuel,
fertilizer, pesticides) to maintain current yields, it is extremely
likely that without industry, these yields would collapse leading to mass starvation in the absence of a significant
response (Moersdorf et al. 2024). Reductions in the agricultural yield of staple crops in the absence of synthetic fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation and mechanization have been
estimated as −35% for rice, −41% for soybeans, −48% for
corn, and −37% for wheat, see Figure 2 (Moersdorf et al.
2024). The main mechanisms which have been proposed as
a potential cause of GCIL are: electric grids disabled and
electronic circuits destroyed due to high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) from a nuclear weapon, solar storms
disabling transformers and transmission lines, electrical grids
and industries disrupted via coordinated cyberattacks, and
extreme pandemic leading to mass death and absenteeism
from critical infrastructure work leading to supply chain failure (Denkenberger et al. 2021). In addition, rapid progress



in artificial intelligence (AI) could become an important
GCIL risk factor: leading AI scientists are now calling
for stronger action on AI risks from world leaders, citing
concerns including large-scale cybercrime and development
of novel biological weapons (Bengio et al. 2024).

Notably, a full-scale nuclear war presents the risk of a
combined ASRS and GCIL catastrophe, in which both the
environmental conditions and critical infrastructure that sustain the current food system are disrupted (Denkenberger
et al. 2017). Rapid AI progress has also been noted as a
potential risk factor for increased nuclear war risk (Maas,
Lucero-Matteucci, and Cooke 2023).

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the fragility of
food systems and the insufficient preparedness of global
governments to handle the shocks to the food system and
supply chains that would occur during a global catastrophe
(Laborde et al. 2020; Liu, Lauta, and Maas 2020). Current
preparedness to feed the surviving global population following a catastrophe is sorely lacking (Boyd et al. 2024; Boyd
and Wilson 2023b; Wilson, Prickett, and Boyd 2023). This is
because there are only enough food stocks to feed the global
population for around 6 months (Denkenberger and Pearce
2014), and little to no preparation to deploy interventions
capable of offsetting a sudden food production loss. The

decline in crop yields resulting from a global catastrophic
food failure would lead to increased food prices, further
worsening global food insecurity (Janetos et al. 2017).
Without proper planning and preparation, billions could die
of starvation (Xia et al. 2022).

Thus, many researchers have agreed that to mitigate the
severity of a global catastrophe, resilient food solutions should
be developed (Avin et al. 2018; Baum et al. 2019; Boyd and
Wilson 2023a; Denkenberger et al. 2022; Ord 2020; Pinsent and
Tan 2024; Ruhl 2023; Sepasspour 2023; Siva and Anderson
2023). These are defined as interventions capable of producing
substantial quantities of calories and essential nutrients even
during a global catastrophe when conventional methods of food
production would be inadequate to feed the global population
(Pham et al. 2022). To be considered a resilient food technology,
a food production method must: 1) provide sufficient food to
reliably feed a significant portion of the global population, 2) be
able to maintain high production during the resource-constrained
period of a global catastrophe, and 3) have the ability to rapidly
ramp up production so it can be available before stored food
runs out. Research and development of these food solutions and
technologies facilitate feeding the global population in a catastrophe, and in the most dire scenarios they could also reduce the
risk of global civilizational collapse by contributing to maintaining nodes of civilizational complexity (Boyd and Wilson 2023a;
Ulloa Ruiz et al. 2024)—reducing existential risk in doing so.
Pham et al. analyzed nutritional combinations of resilient foods
in ASRS and concluded that they could provide a life-sustaining
diet according to dietary guidelines (Pham et al. 2022).

The aim of this literature review is to present the state of
the field of practice in food system interventions with the
potential to prevent mass starvation following a global
catastrophe, with a focus on proposing avenues for further



research and pilot testing. First, a group of food conservation
interventions focused on optimizing crop uses for saving
lives in a catastrophe is discussed (Section “Food conservation interventions”). Next addressed are three groups of
interventions called “resilient food solutions” (Section
“Resilient food solutions”) focused on raising the food production baseline to counter catastrophic crop yield reductions. Then, a review of the policy work done so far to
mitigate the risk is presented (Section “Policy work on resilient food solutions and related interventions”). Finally, the
discussion is focused on the uncertainties involved and future
work to address these (Section “Discussion and future work”).

This work has a partner study titled “ _Food without agri-_
_culture: Food from CO2, biomass and hydrocarbons to secure_
_humanity’s food supply against global catastrophe_ ” (see Section
3.3); combined they seek to update the original work that
kickstarted the research field of foods resilient to global catastrophic food failure: the book “ _Feeding Everyone no Matter_
_What”_ (Denkenberger and Pearce 2014).


**Food conservation interventions**


_**Redirection of crops used in animal agriculture for**_
_**human consumption**_

One fundamental way to feed people during a protracted,
catastrophic food shortage is to redirect food that is currently used to feed animals (mostly for poultry, beef, pork,
egg, and milk production) (Ritchie, Rosado, and Roser
2017), and instead use it as food for people directly. Feeding
animals grains is an extremely inefficient way to obtain calories. Chickens, which are one of the most efficient feed to


calories converting animals, still require about 8 calories in
for every 1 calorie out; this ratio is over 30 for cattle (Cassidy
et al. 2013). It should be pointed out, however, not all of the
feed that is given to animals can be reallocated to people as
humans are not able to digest lignocellulosic material (e.g.,
grass, hay, bark) that other animals, such as ruminants and
some insects, are able to digest. Animals not capable of
digesting lignocellulosic material were not considered a food
resilient to ASRS, see discussion on Appendix B.

Animal feed accounts for 36% of the calories and 53% of
the protein produced by the global crop supply (Cassidy
et al. 2013). An additional 9% of the calories produced by
the global crop supply does not go toward human or animal
consumption, but other purposes such as biofuels (Cassidy
et al. 2013). Based on this, it is estimated that if all crops
grown only went toward human consumption, then the
availability of calories globally would increase by about
70%—thereby enabling the world to feed up to an additional
~4 billion people (Cassidy et al. 2013). This is particularly
pronounced in countries with a very strong meat industry,
for example, Ulloa Ruiz et al. estimated that in Argentina
the gross calorie production is equivalent to the caloric
requirements of ~600 million people—13 times the country’s
population—but the net calorie production (after accounting
for crop use in meat and biofuel production) for internal
food consumption and imports is reduced to ~110 million
(Ulloa Ruiz et al. 2024). This difference is so large that in
extreme ASRS conditions (150 Tg) Argentina would not be
able to feed its population without changes in its meat and
biofuels industries, but not using crops for meat or biofuels
would enable feeding almost 4 times its population (Ulloa
Ruiz et al. 2024). The ASRS food production estimates from
(Xia et al. 2022) and (Rivers et al. 2024) indicate other
countries that appear to similarly be able to not only avoid
starvation but also feed many times their population through
redirection, which include Brazil, Paraguay, and Guyana.
Others such as the United States, Bolivia, Panama, Ireland,
Eswatini, Malaysia, and Indonesia may be able to obtain
enough calories to fulfill the minimum requirement of their
population using mostly redirection—as shown in Figure 3.
Finally, New Zealand, Australia, and Uruguay may not need
to employ redirection to feed their population even in a 150
Tg ASRS, but doing so would free up large amounts of food
that could be used to prevent famine elsewhere. All in all,
(Rivers et al. 2024) estimate that rapid redirection of feed
and biofuel crops for food in combination with rationing,
optimized food stock management and food waste reduction
would vastly increase food availability compared to no adaptations, from 15% to 51% of the global caloric requirement.
For discussion on biofuel crop redirection and food waste
reduction, see the following sections.

Redirecting human-edible food used as animal feed is a
practical method to quickly increase the amount of food
available to the surviving population in the event of a global
catastrophe. Due to the inefficiency of feed to output calorie
ratio of animals, it seems logical that the human-digestible
portion of the food typically fed to animals would be more
efficiently utilized if it was given to people instead (Sandström
et al. 2022). Likewise any land currently dedicated to fodder



crops that is suitable for growing staple crops for people
would be more efficiently utilized that way in a food
catastrophe, whenever possible. This response would likely
be incentivized by economic conditions after a large crop
yield loss, as suggested from economic modeling of nuclear
winter (Hochman et al. 2022) and historical evidence from
World War 2 (Collingham 2013), but government policies
could expedite redirection in abrupt crisis situations to prevent starvation.

Rapidly increasing animal slaughter and meat preservation infrastructure in response to a large disruption would
be useful, but could prove challenging due to the high integration of the meat supply chain (Whitehead and Kim 2022).
Immediate drastic reductions in breeding while maintaining
the existing slaughter capacity would be easier to implement
in order to reduce animal populations to levels that could be
sustained without using food crops as feed. Logistical analysis would be needed to first move the maximum number of
grazing animals from feedlots to pasture, then determine
optimum slaughter rates based on facilities to process and
store the meat. Trials could be done to determine the labor
and capital productivity of switching an employee of one
type of animal slaughter to a different type of animal. Pilot
tests could be done to see how fast breeding could be
stopped and slaughter could be scaled up in existing facilities.

A potential downside to this solution could be a lower
availability of nutrient-rich foods, unless other nutrient-rich
foods are introduced as a replacement (e.g., soybeans that
otherwise would have been fed to cattle, single cell proteins,
grass-fed cattle milk and meat, meat from other
cellulose-digesting animals, or seafood). This is because animal products generally contain more bioavailable levels of
essential minerals and vitamins than crops, such as vitamin
B12, riboflavin, vitamin A, vitamin E, iron, zinc, calcium,
and vitamin D (Turk 2014). This is not a major concern
when nutritional alternatives are available, as in general, vegetarians and vegans are healthier than meat eaters (SegoviaSiapco and Sabaté 2019). In addition, there are methods to
process vegetable crops to increase their nutritional density
to levels similar or higher than animal products with an
overall higher conversion efficiency, from traditional foods
like tofu or tempeh to modern plant-based animal product
substitutes seeking to emulate functional properties like meat
texture, taste and appearance (Wang et al. 2023).


_**Redirection of crops used in biofuel production for**_
_**human consumption**_

There is also the possibility of redirecting crops currently
used in biofuel production for human consumption. The
U.S. is the major producer, and corn is the primary crop
used in biofuels, in the form of ethanol. The amount of corn
that was used for biofuels in the U.S. in 2022 (~5.2 billion
bushels of grain) was approximately equivalent to the caloric
intake of 600 million people (USDA 2024). Biodiesel is
another potential source for redirection as it can be made
from rapeseed, palm, and soybean oils, all of which can be
used as ingredients for food products. The amount of soybean oil that was produced for biodiesel in the U.S. in 2022

the calorie intake status of maintaining current livestock versus maintaining it only partially (Partial Livestock case implies 50% of livestock feed used for human
food and the other 50% still used to feed livestock. + 100% waste represents all household waste added to food consumption.) Material adapted from: Lili Xia,

was approximately equivalent to the caloric intake of over 50
million people (USDA 2024). Although fuel sources would
be critical in a global catastrophe, biofuels comprise only
~5% of the total energy of petroleum fuels even in the U.S.
(EIA 2024), but the crops spent on this equate to twice the
daily per capita calorie needs of the U.S. population. Figure
4 shows historical U.S. production of these biofuels and the
caloric equivalent of the food spent to obtain them in “people fed” at 2,100 kcal/person/day. Other types of biofuels not
based on food crops exist but are a small minority.

Currently, biofuel production mandates in the United
States and much of the world are inflexible, meaning a certain volume of crops must be turned into fuels, no matter
their availability in a given harvest (Weber 2016). This
means in years with an agricultural shortfall, the burden of



reduced supply might fall entirely on animal feed and direct
food uses. Thus, introducing flexibility in biofuel mandates
for crisis situations is an opportunity to generate a “virtual
stock” of food, where in the event of very high prices biofuel blending would fall away due to the structure of the
policy (via buy outs or other mechanisms). This would free
up oilseeds and grains for human consumption in a catastrophe, while still providing a good price for farmers and preserving biofuel policy in typical years.


_**Reducing food loss and waste**_

Food loss occurs throughout the food supply chain up to
the point of sale, while food waste refers to items discarded
by retailers and consumers. In 2022, 13% of global food


**Figure 4.** a) U.S. corn usage for bioethanol production and the caloric equivalent - 2000/01–2021/22, b) U.S. soybean oil usage for biodiesel production and the
caloric equivalent (USDA 2024).



production was lost before reaching consumers, while an
additional 19% was wasted at the retail, food service, and
household levels (Nature Food 2024). Harvest loss reduction is complicated by limited data availability obscuring
the evaluation of interventions to address it. These include
optimizing harvest timing and methods, for example
through capacity building for farmers, adopting more precise mechanized harvesting equipment especially in developing countries, deploying protective measures against
extreme weather such as field covers or shade nets, and
using more resilient crop varieties. Other supply chain
losses, stemming from storage, processing, and transportation, are largely a function of the quality of existing storage



and transport infrastructure, such as metal silos, hermetic
storage, drying equipment, packaging equipment, and cold
chains. This makes them difficult to reduce, especially in
developing countries with limited infrastructure investment
(Nature Food 2024).

Food waste is larger than harvest and distribution losses,
with around 60% coming from households, followed by food
service and retail. This problem is greater in developed countries, and solutions must be addressed at both the individual
and systemic levels, with important regional differences that
need to be considered. Strategies have been proposed to
reduce food waste, including improved waste management/
tracking, improved regulation/quality standards, and reuse/


upcycling (Thi, Kumar, and Lin 2015). Solutions to reuse and
upcycle food waste into food sources range from simple interventions like feeding it to animals or reusing sunflower seed
pressings and brewer’s spent grain processed into flour instead
of being used as feed (Aschemann-Witzel et al. 2023), to
more complex technologies like fermentation processes to
produce single cell proteins and oils from food wastes (Punia
Bangar et al. 2024). Municipal collection of food waste to
upcycle into food could be implemented by local governments
in response to a crisis, but it might require drying at the
household level to prevent spoilage.

Trials could be done to study how fast all these interventions could be implemented in combination with rationing
schemes. As a result of limited food supply and increased
prices during a global catastrophe, industry would likely
implement techniques such as these to reduce losses (during
harvest, distribution, and retail) in order to maximize their
profitability. For example, since the price elasticity of food
waste is −1.49 (Landry and Smith 2019), a tripling of food
price would be expected to reduce the post-harvest waste
from 24–29% to about 6–10% (Verma et al. 2020).


**Resilient food solutions**

This section discusses the food production options that have
been proposed in the literature as resilient against ASRS
and/or GCIL, a selection of which is shown in the chart of
Figure 5. The resilient food solutions have been divided into



three groups of interventions focused on raising the food
production baseline to counter catastrophic crop yield reductions. First, land-based solutions (3.1) including grass-fed
ruminants, crop relocation, greenhouses, cropland expansion, leaf protein, and mushrooms, followed by water-based
solutions (3.2) such as fishing, microalgae production, and
farming of seaweed and bivalves, then finally high-tech
industrial solutions for the production of food without agriculture or sunlight (3.3). Each of the subsections describes a
resilient food intervention following this structure: a brief
description of the food production method, an explanation
of the reasons why the intervention is particularly useful in
a global catastrophe, an overview of current production and
cost values and estimates of its production potential and
cost during a global catastrophe, whenever available, and a
set of key research questions to further characterize its
potential and catastrophe readiness.


_**Land-based solutions**_


_**Ruminants fed on grass and agricultural residues**_
Ruminants (e.g., cows, sheep, goats) can live on plant biomass which humans cannot digest, including grass and agricultural residues (e.g., corn stalks, wheat straw, most leaves).
As of 2022, there were 4.3 billion ruminants globally (FAO
2024). There remains, however, uncertainty as to how much
of the existing dairy cattle population could be sustained in
severe ASRS or GCIL. Modern dairy cattle such as Holstein



**Figure 5.** Representation of the space of resilient foods with selected examples based on how resilient the authors consider them to ASRS and GCIL, in terms of
how much their production yields would be affected by the different catastrophes. Placements are approximate, as some methods can be done at a wide variety
of technological complexity, but the simplest method is generally shown. Note that this graphic does not include fundamental considerations for the potential of
these methods for resilient food production, such as production cost, capital intensity, or speed of mass deployment.


cows, which have been optimized to produce as much milk
as possible and make up the vast majority of ruminant populations in many regions of the world, are typically fed considerable amounts of grains as part of their diet. Holstein
cows can survive on an all-herbage diet, provided they have
high-quality forages (Schori and Münger 2021). An important uncertainty is how they would cope in the long-term
with diets based on widely available agricultural residues
such as from wheat, which is much lower in protein and
more fibrous. Future work on feed trials could address this,
by giving evidence-based estimates of whether Holsteins
provide an efficient way to upcycle widespread agricultural
residues with net-positive calorie generation (more energy
contained in the milk than in the amount of human edible
grains included in their feed). If this was feasible, Rivers
et al. estimated that grass-fed milk could provide the equivalent of ~8.5% of the global population’s caloric requirements (Rivers et al. 2024). Non-protein nitrogen
supplementation could be useful as ruminants can digest
moderate amounts (Shen et al. 2023), such as from urea or
ammonium salts, which are widely available industrially.
Other modern dairy breeds such as Jerseys or Guernseys
may be better adapted to cope with these lower-energy diets,
but they are less common, and replacing the dominant cattle
breeds would take precious time in a global catastrophe.
Research on a plan that considers all these factors to optimize the utilization of agricultural residues on a catastrophe
would be valuable.


_**Crop relocation**_
This solution entails the relocation of cold tolerant crops
from the more northern latitudes (where they are often
grown) to the regions with a less afflicted climate in an
ASRS, in lower latitudes where temperatures would likely
remain suitable for their cultivation and where there would
be a large amount of arable land in the event of severe
reduction in sunlight (Rivers et al. 2024; Wilson et al. 2023).
This includes chilling tolerant crops capable of withstanding
temperatures between 0–15 °C (e.g., potatoes, rapeseed/
canola, and some types of beans)—whose cultivation appears
feasible even in the lowest temperature scenarios in vast
areas of land mostly in and around the tropics, likely to
remain frost-free during the growing season (Coupe et al.
2019)—as well as frost tolerant crops (e.g., wheat, sugar beet,
and barley). See tables 2–3 of Wilson, Payne, and Boyd
(2023) for examples of promising crops in these categories.

Adaptations to the global distribution of crops have been
extensively studied as a solution to ongoing food security
challenges, hinting at their potential for response to extreme
shocks. Models of reconfiguring crop distribution show it is
possible to feed an additional 825 million people using current croplands while also using 12–14% less water (Davis
et al. 2017), and that it is possible to palliate expected crop
yield losses from climate change by adjusting the crop cultivars being grown (Minoli et al. 2022). The use of traditional
local plants has also been proposed as a possible contributor
to catastrophic resilience (Winstead, Jacobson, and Di Gioia
2023), although more research is needed to characterize



their resilient food potential in terms of scalability, rapid
deployment, and cost.

Even in a severe nuclear winter scenario (150 Tg), hundreds of millions of people could be fed by relocating a few
cold tolerant crops en masse (Rivers et al. 2024). These
crops would then supply a wide range of essential vitamins
and minerals as well as have the potential to fulfill most of
humanity’s nutritional needs following a global catastrophe,
if allocated effectively (Rivers et al. 2024). Therefore, by
leveraging intensive application of all available fertilizers, in
addition to redirecting capital and resources where relevant,
the yields of these relocated crops could be supported. Note
that in this scenario crop relocation alone often would not
be able to feed the population of every single country when
considering each country separately, though it could feed
significant numbers. Rivers et al. estimated that if international food trade stopped completely, famine would affect
32–85% of the population even with various resilient foods
in a severe nuclear winter scenario (Rivers et al. 2024). This
highlights the paramount importance of maintaining international as well as intra-national trade and cooperation for
saving lives during catastrophes.

It is fundamental to consider which crops can contribute
most to nutrition in an ASRS. For example, some legumes
such as forage legumes, e.g., alfalfa, show particular promise
in terms of cold tolerance (Bhat et al. 2022), but they have
not yet been studied in depth for ASRS response, and should
be subjected to ASRS yield modeling to evaluate their potential. Another example are frost-resistant crops, which are resilient to the out-of-season frosts that occurred in previous
ASRSs such as the “year without summer” caused by Mount
Tambora in 1815 (Wilson, Payne, and Boyd 2023). A New
Zealand-specific study finds that current production levels of
frost resistant crops could not feed all New Zealand citizens
following a nuclear war, but expanding their cultivation would
suffice (Wilson, Payne, and Boyd 2023), and chilling resistant
crops could make significant contributions as well. It is
important to note that a crop does not necessarily have to be
frost resistant to contribute to nutrition in a 150 Tg nuclear
winter, because even in these extreme conditions many tropical and subtropical areas (especially in the Southern
Hemisphere) are likely to remain frost-free during the growing season (Coupe et al. 2019). Other areas are unlikely to
have significant growing seasons, with some potential exceptions such as New Zealand (Boyd and Wilson 2023a).

Rapeseed is not only an ASRS-resilient source of fats and
other key nutrients, it has also been proposed as a potential
source of biofuel for maintaining agricultural production in
case of diesel shortages due to trade restrictions in
fuel-importing regions such as New Zealand during global
catastrophes, with wheat being particularly efficient at yielding significant food per unit of fuel spent to cultivate it
(Boyd et al. 2024).

There are many challenges behind rapid crop relocation.
Firstly, the rapid deployment of cold tolerant seeds to a substantial area of the lower latitudes would need to be done as
quickly as possible, which may require the replanting of
seeds currently stored for consumption (Rivers et al. 2024).
Secondly, support and training would need to be provided


on a large scale to farmers to educate them on how to successfully grow crops they may have never cultivated (Rivers
et al. 2024). Thirdly, the initiative could require significant
international and intra-national cooperation as well as trade
agreements for the distribution of seeds, agricultural inputs,
and expertise—which could be provided by those in the
Northern areas where cultivation is hard or impossible in
severe ASRS—along with the land, labor, and local skills
from those in the lower latitudes (Rivers et al. 2024). There
are exceptions to this for relocation of crops within large
countries (e.g., U.S., Brazil, Argentina) which would not
require international cooperation. Fourthly, a sufficiently
large starting amount of seeds is important to achieve a sufficiently fast deployment.

This solution would benefit from pilot testing. For example, there is a need for testing the deployment of relevant
crops under simulated ASRS conditions to validate crop
growth models, such as in growth chambers or specialized
outdoor locations (perhaps using a mesh to simulate lower
solar irradiation and temperature in cool, dry areas, or a
cool greenhouse). Furthermore, it would be valuable to test
the capacity of farmers to rapidly switch en masse to crop
varieties they are unfamiliar with, to better understand how
feasible it is and how it might impact yields. Finally, emergency crop saving strategies already used to prevent frost
damage in critical stages of growth can be explored for
ASRS that include active control methods like heating with
fuel or electricity, sprinkling, wind machines, and agricultural plastic tenting (Poling 2007).



_**Greenhouses**_
Going one step further than temporary protective tenting, to
supplement crop relocation, the rapid deployment of simple
polymer-cover greenhouses could enable the cultivation of
additional crops with a temperature-improved climate. This
would improve the yield per hectare of crops that are temperature sensitive and enable the cultivation of crops in
areas where they would not otherwise be able to be grown
due to the climate. Greenhouses trap heat from sunlight to
create a warmer environment for crop growth (Alvarado
et al. 2020). They are widely used in many different regions
around the world and on various scales from shed-sized to
massive industrial agriculture buildings. Globally, over 1.3
million hectares were used to produce food in greenhouses
by 2019 (Tong et al. 2024).

There exist low-tech open-source greenhouse designs
based on plastic sheets and simple wooden or plastic structures (Alvarado et al. 2020). Similar greenhouses have been
deployed at a large scale (von Zabeltitz 2011). Simple greenhouses that have historically been used in many regions are
large-area, made of wood and plastic, and passively ventilated (Vanthoor et al. 2012). There also exist low-cost,
open-source, automatic irrigation systems which could be
used in these greenhouses (Wiggert et al. 2019). If the necessary processes to ramp up greenhouse development and
deployment can be successfully executed in a catastrophe,
then they could potentially provide ~30% of the global food
requirements after the first year, although there would be



challenges such as limited polymer extrusion capacity
(Alvarado et al. 2020).

This intervention needs further research, and pilots should
be performed since mass fast deployment of greenhouse technology has not yet been tested and there may not be sufficient infrastructure for it. This should include all steps of the
production chain, such as sawnwood, construction steel, and
plastic film and sheet. Furthermore, alternative ways of scaling
low-tech greenhouses could be investigated further, such as
polymer tube framing, and household scale lumber production. Structural analysis could be performed to find the most
suitable designs, given the potential risks from adverse meteorological conditions such as strong rain, snowfall, hail or
wind. The economically optimized selection of construction
materials for all adapted greenhouses is very location dependent (Rana et al. 2023), so the structural engineering of
appropriate designs will need to be run with all the available
materials. In addition, research could look into retrofitting
existing structures with plastic sheeting on the sides to create
simple greenhouses, such as the rapidly emerging agrivoltaic
arrays (Vandewetering, Hayibo, and Pearce 2022), including
wood-based fixed and variable tilt arrays as well as most traditional not tracking racking with semi-transparent modules.
There are also research directions to assess the extent to
which the current large-scale plowing, planting, harvesting
and irrigation method of open-air agriculture could be
adapted to greenhouses. For instance, one could evaluate
whether center pivot or other large-scale irrigation methods
could be adapted for greenhouses and whether surface and
localized irrigation could continue in an ASRS. To maximize
yields and diet variety, a useful research topic would be determining, for each region, the most suitable crops and cultivars
to be grown in such greenhouses in an ASRS. In turn, this
would require more detailed modeling of the environmental
conditions inside greenhouses in an ASRS, and further investigation of irrigation and nutrient requirements by crop, cultivar, and region. Other uncertainties requiring further
research include: whether the temperature will be sufficiently
raised with just the polymer cover as an insulator or if supplemental heating is needed, and whether the plastic cover
would reduce the solar radiation so much as to make the
plants grow improperly in severe ASRS, since they require a
balance of temperature and sunlight for proper growth.


_**Expansion of planted crop area**_
There is a vast amount of cropland which is not actually harvested for agricultural use for numerous reasons (Everest,
Sungur, and Özcan 2021). In the U.S. alone, 22 million acres
are enrolled under the conservation reserve scheme (Pratt
2023), but these could be put into agricultural use at short
notice if needed during a global catastrophe. Government
financial support could help make cropland that is currently
too cost prohibitive to use become economically viable and
convert new areas into profitable croplands (Zheng et al.
2023). Leveraging cropland that is used for non-food crops
could free up considerable amounts of land for food production globally, for example cotton alone takes 33 million hectares or 2% of the global cultivated area, and there are many


others taking several million hectares such as rubber, tobacco,
or flax, as well as non-essential beverage crops such as coffee
and tea (Ritchie and Roser 2024). A significant portion of
pasture land used to grow forage crops for livestock production could be converted into cropland. 26% of global forest
area (~10 million km [2] ) has a slope less than 26% and trees
younger than 20 years, making it suitable for agriculture. In
less than a year, cropland could potentially be doubled
(Monteiro et al. 2024). In addition, more food could be produced using conventional urban or near-urban agriculture
methods as long as industry is maintained (Meyer et al. 2021;
Boyd and Wilson 2024)—these can sometimes achieve higher
yields than commercial agriculture (Payen et al. 2022), make
more complete use of the crop, and may provide psychological reassurance around food security in a crisis.

The main technologies required to expand cropland include
construction equipment to level the land and remove debris,
as well as forestry equipment for tree removal. The main bottleneck for rapid mass expansion would probably be the availability of this machinery, especially in regions where it is not
commonly in use. One way to address this could be different
countries sharing equipment to expedite planted area expansion as a resilient food response to ASRS, especially sharing
the machinery located in regions unable to obtain significant
crop yields in an ASRS, as could be the case of many Northern
Hemisphere regions. Research is needed for cataloging and
planning for such equipment transfers.

Further research with additional crop models is required
to better assess the production potential of crop area expansion. Prioritizing the land to clear based on economic return
could more accurately predict the expansion of food supply.
This would also allow comparative economics with other
resilient food sources. In addition, more research is warranted on market incentives and other policies to encourage
food production, particularly in the land currently used for
crops detrimental to public health, such as tobacco.

Though expanding planted area is a mature technology,
there are still valuable pilots to be done. For instance, some
areas which currently only support isolated shrubs or arid
vegetation could become arable in ASRS. These areas that are
currently too dry to cultivate may become viable in ASRS if
the crops’ evapotranspiration is reduced due to lower temperatures and higher relative humidity, despite the reduction in
rainfall—though this remains speculative and water stress
could worsen in some areas in an ASRS. A tantalizing precedent is the Sahara desert being relatively green during the past
glaciation (Tierney, Pausata, and deMenocal 2017). Therefore,
simulating nuclear winter conditions with an air-conditioned
greenhouse in some of these promising areas could be valuable to assess the viability in actual soil conditions. Finally,
research into rapid redirection of water and irrigation implementation to new cultivation areas would be valuable. Planting
crops with higher calorie to irrigation ratios could limit water
demand in places where that would remain a bottleneck.


_**Leaf protein concentrate (LPC)**_
LPC is a protein-rich, nutrient-dense food made using the
nontoxic non-woody parts of plants (Anoop et al. 2023).



Producing LPC is a relatively simple process consisting of: 1)
mechanical pressing (leaf grinding/pulping), 2) protein precipitation (e.g., by heating, acidification, or other means),
and 3) protein concentration (separation and drying)
(Santamaría-Fernández and Lübeck 2020). LPC can be consumed in a variety of forms, such as protein powder or concentrate, and is currently consumed by both people and
animals.

LPC has been produced on both household and small
industrial scales (Nagy et al. 1978), with several industrial
plants producing feed and food ingredients in Europe
(Santamaría-Fernández and Lübeck 2020), and is now gaining traction as an alternative protein source (Anoop et al.
2023), but LPC has yet to be mass produced globally for
human consumption. Companies such as Leaft Foods and
Rubisco Foods are working on the mass commercialization
of alfalfa-based leaf proteins for use in plant-based protein
foods. Other LPC food companies include Grassa and The
Leaf Protein Co. Large-scale production of LPC is often
used as a replacement for soybean meal protein in animal
feed (Ayyat et al. 2021).

Small scale production of LPC has been done in developing countries as a food source for arid and malnourished
areas (Rathore 2010). Small scale LPC production can be
done relatively easily with limited training, but with lower
yields compared to industrial operations (SantamaríaFernández and Lübeck 2020). A simple open-source LPC
press that can be 3-D printed has been developed (Wentworth
2019), and far more sophisticated planetary roller screw
designs for other food processing could be used for LPC
and also are readily amenable to mass-scale distributed manufacturing. LPC has potential to bridge nutritional deficits
including protein and fiber and contains vitamins, minerals,
and a combination of essential amino acids, making them a
suitable alternative to animal foods. The simplicity of the
process, accessibility of plant matter in most locations, and
its many other qualities make LPC a highly resilient food
option during a catastrophe such as an ASRS or GCIL. It
should be pointed out that the general LPC bitter, grassy
taste and especially its labor-intensity could be considerable
barriers to widespread adoption (Cox et al. 1993). These
issues could be bypassed by using the LPC as animal feed,
although at notably lower overall food production efficiency.

In just Nigeria alone, it is estimated that the application
of LPC technologies to agricultural residues could produce
between 3.0–13.8 million Gcal/year through direct consumption and animal feed uses, equivalent to the caloric requirement of an estimated 3.9 to 18.1 million people, covering a
large share of Nigeria’s food deficit (Ugwoke et al. 2023)—
though this is probably an upper bound of the potential,
requiring LPC toxicity testing to confirm. The application of
LPC was estimated to extract up to 5 times more food than
the status quo of mostly feeding it directly to ruminants
(Ugwoke et al. 2023). Figure 6 shows the case of higher end
of potential yield (13.8 million Gcal) through a Sankey diagram of the Nigeria analysis assuming LPC-enhanced residue utilization and optimal efficiencies.

In an ASRS, a considerable number of leaves would die
from the lack of sunlight, including from plants that are not


**Figure 6.** Energy flow diagram showing the potential of leveraging LPC from agricultural residues to improve food security in Nigeria, showing the case of
improved residue utilization assuming optimistic efficiencies (energy flows per year), resulting in ~5 times more calories extracted than just feeding the residues
to ruminants. Material adapted from: Blessing Ugwoke, Ross Tieman, Aron Mill, David Denkenberger and Joshua M. Pearce, Quantifying Alternative Food Potential
of Agricultural Residue in Rural Communities of Sub-Saharan Africa, _Biomass_, published 2023 by MDPI (CC BY 4.0 license, no changes made).



of agricultural origin, and this stock of “killed leaves” has
been proposed as a significant source of nutrition which
could serve as a “stopgap” food while other interventions are
in the deployment stage (Denkenberger and Pearce 2014),
but the gathering of these leaves could prove economically
challenging. This is in contrast with the LPC utilization of
the agricultural residues that could be generated during the
ASRS, such as wheat leaves from relocated crops.

Creating a publicly available database of proven safe to eat
LPCs is a key opportunity for making LPC more commercially viable, to address the challenge of most leaves not being
practical for LPC production. In addition, some leaves commonly used for LPC have anti-nutritional factors (Hussein
et al. 1999). Creating such a database could be achieved by
using an open-source liquid chromatography coupled mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) toxicity testing pipeline (J. Pearce,
Khaksari, and Denkenberger 2019) to quickly assess regionally
applicable LPC input sources obtained by a network of locally
owned production facilities around the world. There has been
some screening of toxins done in various LPCs which indicates that it is safe for human consumption, provided that
good practices such as improved residue harvesting and processing methods which reduce mold growth and presence of
mycotoxins such as Aflatoxin B1 are used (Meyer et al. 2023),
but further validation would be beneficial. Efforts to map the
distribution of relevant forest classes and leaf biomass for LPC
are important, but more work is needed (Fist et al. 2021).
Low tech processing and toxin analysis of common North
American coniferous trees indicated potential for consumption (Mottaghi et al. 2023), though harvesting of significant
leafy biomass may only be viable in conjunction with harvesting main tree body for other uses, such as fuel or lignocellulosic sugar production (see Section “Food without agriculture:
high-tech food solutions for ASRS”).



_**Mushrooms**_
Mushrooms can be grown both outdoors in the natural
environment or, more relevant to a global catastrophic scenario, indoors under dark, cool, and slightly damp conditions. They are relatively fast growing as a food source,
enabling a quick ramp up to meet a significant fraction of
the global caloric needs (Denkenberger and Pearce 2014). It
is estimated that in 2021, however, the global mushroom
production was 44 million tonnes (FAO 2024), which works
out to only about 0.2% of the minimum recommended
caloric intake for the global population, as the vast majority
of the mushroom mass is water (typically ~85–95%).

The major benefits of mushrooms are that they are easy
to grow, can be grown almost anywhere, even on decomposing wood and landfills, can be scaled up quickly as each one
produces around a billion spores (Dressaire et al. 2016), and
do not require sunlight, making them a promising food
source in the event of ASRS. If treated with ultraviolet light,
they can be a good source of vitamin D, an essential nutrient which would be difficult to obtain in an ASRS, due to
the reduction in sunlight availability for one’s skin to absorb
it naturally, and the potential risk of trying to do so if the
ozone layer is damaged in the ASRS (Pham et al. 2022).
This would be especially important if one’s diet contains few
animal or microbial foods, the only other dietary sources of
vitamin D. In addition, the waste from mushroom cultivation could be used as a feed source for organisms such as
ruminants that are able to digest cellulose (Denkenberger
et al. 2017).

Although mushrooms can convert indigestible plant biomass into food, they are not able to do it as efficiently or at
as low of a cost as other food production methods as they
have high economic and energy costs per calorie produced
(Denkenberger et al. 2019; Salehi et al. 2014). Mushrooms


can make significant micronutritional contributions to the
diet, however, and automation has been proposed as a means
to significantly reduce production cost through reduction of
their intensive labor cost. Pilot research to assess the feasibility of individuals growing a large percentage of their calories from mushrooms, perhaps in basements with limited
training and electricity, could be relevant for combined
ASRS and GCIL scenarios. In addition, work in co-locating
mushrooms, which produce carbon dioxide, with photosynthetic forms of indoor growing, like greenhouses, could be
valuable to optimize yield per area.


_**Water-based solutions**_


_**Low-tech microalgae cultivation**_
Microalgae are microscopic forms of algal biomass which
grow in water by fixing CO2 through photosynthesis using
sunlight or other sources of light energy. They are highly
nutritious and have a long history of being used for food by
people, such as in Chad and Mexico. Microalgae are commercially cultivated in: 1) high-tech photobioreactors using
artificial light; 2) translucent photobioreactors (e.g., made of
plastic) using sunlight; 3) indoor raceway ponds covered by
a temperature-controlled greenhouse; and 4) open air raceway ponds which are a simple way to grow large quantities
of biomass at lower cost, but which result in lower yields
due to minimal control over growing conditions (García
Martínez, Behr, and Denkenberger 2024). Current photobioreactor technology is not resilient to GCIL scenarios and is
considerably more energy-intensive and costly when using
artificial light compared to other resilient foods for ASRS
response, with state of the art microalgae systems having
~2% conversion efficiency of electricity to calories compared
to hydrogenotrophic bacteria at over 10% (García Martínez,
Behr, and Denkenberger 2024), so only the other methods
are considered potentially relevant here. Cost estimates of
microalgae production in open ponds indicate promise, for
example, a final slurry product containing 20% mass content
of microalgae could be obtained at a cost of ~$0.70 per dry
kg, although producing a food grade and/or dried product
could result in much higher costs. However, it has been estimated that using the top 5% most suitable areas near 20 km
of the coast for microalgae cultivation could produce 588
megatonne/year, more than the global protein demand projected for 2050 (Greene et al., 2022). More discussion of
microalgae can be found in a partner study (García Martínez,
Behr, and Denkenberger 2024). Economic and scale-up
models are needed to characterize the potential of microalgae in ponds or simple sunlight-based bioreactors as a resilient food source for global catastrophes.


_**Seaweed**_
There is considerable underutilized potential for production
of seaweed in the ocean, which can be used in a variety of
foods consumed directly, or for animal feeds. Cultivation of
seaweed can be fairly simple, using minimal technological
resources including little more than ropes, buoys, anchors,



and boats—although these systems are very labor-intensive,
especially when compared with more high-tech automated
systems. Seaweed can also be deployed relatively fast without
experienced labor using longline systems (Tullberg, Nguyen,
and Wang 2022). By increasing seaweed production, there
could be numerous benefits toward nutrition, employment,
and mitigation of CO2 emissions, especially through cattle
feed (Duarte, Bruhn, and Krause-Jensen 2021).

Seaweed cultivation in the ocean has been performed for
centuries in many regions, particularly around East and
Southeast Asia, starting in the 1600s in Korea using simple
bamboo structures (Hwang et al. 2020), but historically
remained fairly small in scale. Cultivation of seaweed has
grown tremendously in the past 70 years, reaching 35 million
tonnes (wet mass) in 2019 (Cai et al. 2021). At an increased
14% per year growth rate of cultivation, seaweed would yield
approximately 500 million tonnes (dry weight) by 2050, which
would increase the current world’s food supply by about 10%,
by taking up only ~0.03% of the ocean surface (World Bank
Group 2016). Globally 20–48 million km [2] are estimated to be
suitable for seaweed production with yields of 900–3,300
tonnes (dry)/km [2] /year (Jehn, Dingal, et al. 2024), implying
this area has the potential to produce the equivalent of the
global population’s calorie requirement many times over.

Research by Jehn et al. indicates that, in less than a year,
global seaweed production could be increased to create an
equivalent of 45% of the global calorie demand, see Figure
7 (Jehn, Dingal, et al. 2024), although such a degree of
scaleup would require scaling up other industries required
for the cultivation infrastructure such as rope production.
Scaling up the seaweed species currently cultivated as a
response to a global catastrophe would increase the availability of food for consumers and feedstock for biochemicals,
biofuels or other bioproducts, if needed. The popular but
more expensive species of seaweed could be switched to
other species with faster growth rates or higher nutritional
contents to serve as a quick and scalable addition to people’s
diets in the event of an ASRS (Jehn, Dingal, et al. 2024).
Achieving this is relatively straightforward as different established species of seaweed usually have similar equipment
needs and cultivation techniques (Taelman et al. 2015). Most
seaweed cultivation is nearshore in wave-sheltered or
semi-sheltered waters (Visch et al. 2023).

Seaweed production is not only resilient and capable of
generating very large amounts of food, but is also
cost-effective in ASRS. Hinge et al. estimated that in an
ASRS up to ~250 million tonnes/year of dry seaweed could
be produced at $0.50/kg or less, covering ~10% of direct
human food needs on a caloric basis, or ~750 million
tonnes/year at $1/kg or less. Roughly half of this cost originates from cultivation and the other half from drying.
Seaweed could be produced in significant quantities even
using just shallow waters close to ports in a few key areas
in the tropics. The countries with the highest production
potential in ASRS at low costs are Indonesia, Nigeria, India,
Angola, Philippines, Peru, and Mexico (Hinge et al. 2024).
Figure 7 shows how the Pacific cold tongue has a vast area
of high yield potential, but it would be hard to exploit economically given the deep water and great distance from


**Figure 7.** a) Global locations of seaweed ( _Gracilaria tikvahiae_ ) growth regime clusters for a 150 Tg nuclear war scenario (3 is high growth, 1 is moderate growth);
b) Seaweed production as percent of human food demand for suitable seaweed growth clusters (150 Tg nuclear war scenario and 30% per day as optimal growth
rate). This is optimized for meeting an equivalent of 45% of the global human food demand on average for the whole 10 years (gray line), so cluster 1 requires
much more area. Material adapted from: Florian Ulrich Jehn, Farrah Jasmine Dingal, Aron Mill, Cheryl Harrison, Ekaterina Ilin, Michael Y. Roleda, Scott C. James,

made).



shore. Perhaps ways to exploit that potential during an ASRS
could be found; for example, combining seaweed growth
with fishing operations in the area might help.

There is a limit to the amount of seaweed that people
could eat due to its high iodine and other mineral content
(Jehn, Dingal, et al. 2024), but there are seaweed treatment
methods that address this effectively (Zava and Zava 2011).
In addition, not all populations can digest seaweed as efficiently. For example, East Asian populations generally have
better gut flora for seaweed digestion (Pudlo et al. 2022).

Future work to develop the potential of seaweed to prevent
global famine in catastrophes should analyze the scale up of the
infrastructure needed for seaweed cultivation and processing,
especially drying which can make up a significant share of the
final product cost. Pilot testing of rapid seaweed deployment at
scale should be done to determine its feasibility for rapid food
catastrophe response. Drafting a fast deployment plan to quickly
ramp up seaweed cultivation in the event of a global catastrophe
could help ensure its success as a resilient food source. This may



include rapid tooling (e.g., fiber and rope production, rope
twisting) and supply chain risk management (e.g., import and/
or export of spores/fragments) as well as personnel deployment
planning. Research could be undertaken on the topic of increasing the digestibility of seaweed—especially for populations that
have not historically consumed significant quantities and thus
may possess suboptimal gut flora—including methods for seaweed processing and extraction of seaweed nutrients, as well as
supplements (e.g., probiota) to overcome the challenge of gut
flora to aid digestion.

Seaweed cultivation is already commercialized on land in
large pools by companies like Acadian Seaplants and could
be scaled considerably to provide food during a catastrophe.
Future work is needed to assess the potential of onland seaweed cultivation in emergencies at the industrial scale as
well as potentially on the community scale by converting hot
tubs and pools into seaweed farms. Open-source control systems for photobioreactors could be developed to accelerate
both of these potential sources of resilient food.


_**Regular fishing**_
Fish would continue to be a useful food source even in the
event of a global catastrophe since they could continue to be
harvested normally, as long as the relevant infrastructure is
operational (e.g., liquid fuel production, spare parts for fishing vessels, refrigeration technology, port facilities, navigation and sonar equipment, weather forecasting), but even
with very limited infrastructure some low-tech fishing could
be maintained. The world catches approximately 178 million
tonnes (live weight) of aquatic animals (excluding mammals)
annually (FAO 2022b). Fishing currently contributes ~35 kcal/
person/day to the average diet, equivalent to only ~1.7% of
the global human caloric requirement (though it is a considerable ~7% of the protein requirement) (FAO 2020). The
amount available in ASRS is uncertain due to conflicting
factors, but models point to some reduction in availability.
For example, recent physical ocean models suggest that the
reduced light and cooler ocean temperatures that would
occur during an ASRS would negatively impact fish populations, e.g., with global biomass and catch expected to fall by
up to 18 ± 3% and 29 ± 7% in a 150 Tg nuclear winter scenario (Harrison et al. 2022; Scherrer et al. 2020), see Figure
8 for various possible scenarios. In an ASRS the increased
cooling of the upper layers of the ocean could increase
upwelling thus bringing more nutrients to the ocean surface,
but models indicate an overall negative effect. (Denkenberger
et al. 2017) have also proposed that fertilizing the ocean



with macronutrients such as nitrate and phosphate may help
maintain fish densities in an ASRS, which could be useful in
scenarios where land agriculture is decimated but significant
fertilizer production remains. More research is needed on
these uncertainties.

The collapse of food webs in a severe ASRS scenario
would likely cause a mass extinction event both on land and
in the ocean, regardless of the success or failure of resilient
food interventions. Impacts on ocean biodiversity and the
long term livelihoods of fishers may be reduced in an ASRS
by focusing on other resilient food solutions for fulfilling the
population’s protein requirement. In addition, implementing
effective fisheries management and expansion of marine
reserves prior to a catastrophe would increase the oceans’
potential contribution during a global food emergency
(Scherrer et al. 2020), while likely reducing the risk of mass
ocean collapse resulting from it as well as producing more
food in normal conditions.

The likely limiting factor for expanding fishing would be
the availability and capacity of fishing boats. Military, shipping, and personal craft boats could, however, potentially be
repurposed as fishing vessels and larger boats could be leveraged for ship-to ship cargo transfer to minimize travel distance (Denkenberger and Pearce 2014), and this could warrant
pilot testing. One important piece of future work is incorporating nutrients from river runoff into existing fisheries and
ocean ASRS models (Harrison et al. 2022; Scherrer et al. 2020).

_**Deep sea fishing (mesopelagic fish)**_
In the mesopelagic region of the deep sea, there are numerous species of fish which are suitable for human consumption. It has been estimated that there are 10 billion tonnes
of mesopelagic fish biomass, likely dominating the world’s
total fish biomass (Irigoien et al. 2014). This total mass,
assuming an average calorie content of ~1,500 kcal/kg based
on (Alvheim et al. 2020), equates to just over twice the
yearly caloric requirement of the global population. Very
limited fishing in this region is done, however, as the harvesting season is short and the ventures are not always profitable (Fjeld et al. 2023). Between 2015 to 2019, deep sea
fishing of 26 vessels in the North-East Atlantic amassed on
the order of magnitude of 10 [5] tons per year (spending a
combined total of ~30,000 h per year fishing) (Paoletti
et al. 2021).

Many species of fish found in the mesopelagic region
are high in omega-3 fatty acids and other key micronutrients (Alvheim et al. 2020). Deep sea fishing could make
significant contributions during an ASRS as it is currently
underexploited and could be a reliable source of fish when
regular fish populations decline, as suggested by Scherrer
et al. (2020). Specialized shipping vessels for deep sea fishing are likely not required, but the vessels should be capable of capturing various different species of fish (Fjeld
et al. 2023). Although deep sea fishing has the potential to
be profitable, in some locations the catch per ship would
be too low, with high bycatch (Paoletti et al. 2021).
Preliminary analysis is needed to characterize the potential,
cost, and feasibility of rapid mass deployment of mesopelagic fishing technologies for ASRS and GCIL response.
This should look at the potential for converting bycatch to
food and any technical improvements to be made to make
deep-sea fishing economic. If the potential was high, a
pilot demonstration of repurposing ships into fishing vessels would be valuable.



_**Krill fishing**_
Krill, a well-known type of mesopelagic crustacean, are a
common food source for many marine animals, but they are
also suitable for direct human consumption. It is one of the
most numerous animals on Earth, with an estimated biomass of at least 379 million tonnes (wet) around the poles
(Atkinson et al. 2009). Primarily Antarctic krill ( _E. superba_ )
are fished in the Southwest Atlantic using trawlers, as well
as North Pacific krill ( _E. pacifica_ ), with a total annual catch
of 450,000 tonnes (Cappell, MacFadyen, and ConsTable
2022). From a nutritional perspective, krill is an excellent
protein, containing every essential amino acid, and is high
in antioxidants and omega-3, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and vitamins A and E (Tou, Jaczynski, and Chen 2007).

The low availability of infrastructure and knowledge to
catch krill is a critical limitation for krill fishing as a resilient food intervention. Other limitations include a better
understanding of krill population management and more
accurate population monitoring technology (Nicol, Foster,
and Kawaguchi 2012). Preliminary analysis is needed to
characterize the potential, cost, and feasibility of rapid mass
deployment of krill fishing technologies for ASRS and GCIL



response. It is likely that existing trawling fishing vessels and
personnel could be utilized to increase krill catch (Nicol,
Foster, and Kawaguchi 2012), and this could be tested as a
catastrophe preparedness pilot experiment. Future research
could also investigate low-cost industrial and distributed
means to manufacture the fine mesh nets needed for harvesting krill.


_**Bivalve cultivation**_
Bivalves, including clams, oysters, cockles, mussels, and
scallops, can be grown similar to seaweed, on ropes suspended in the water from a long line supported by buoys,
and feed on widely available phytoplankton. Global bivalve
production was on average ~15 million tonnes per annum
between 2010–2015, with 89% of that coming from aquaculture (Wijsman et al. 2019). Bivalve production yields
vary considerably depending on the species and environment, but reported values for mussels are high, ranging
between 6,000–59,400 tonne/km [2] /year (Gren 2019), or
roughly 1,300-13,000 tonnes (dry)/km [2] /year. Within the
exclusive economic zones of suitable countries, 31 million
km [2] are estimated to be environmentally suitable for molluscs (Oyinlola et al. 2018), a fraction of which would suffice to cover the equivalent of the global population’s
caloric requirement even at the lower end of yield—which
is probably more representative of a farming style not
requiring external nutrient addition. Considering only the
coastlines, where production would be most economical,
the potential of bivalve mariculture has been estimated at
592 megatonne (Willer, Nicholls, and Aldridge 2021),
which at 80% water content would cover ~7% of the global
food requirement.

What makes bivalves a promising resilient food technology is their simple cultivation (Helm and Bourne 2004),
high nutritional value, existence of a developed industry, and
resilience to sunlight reduction—their primary substrate
(phytoplankton) is less affected by changes in sunlight than
land crops (Harrison et al. 2022; Xia et al. 2022). 50–70% of
the calorie content of bivalves comes from protein, and they
provide complete proteins, are a great source of sodium,
potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, and
chromium, and are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids with
high levels of DHA and EPA (Karnjanapratum et al. 2013),
unlike many other resilient foods which are poor in omega-3
fatty acids. The cost of producing bivalves is between $1–4/
kg (wet) (Wijsman et al. 2019), which at 80% water content
translates to $5–20/kg (dry) or $2.50-10.00 to fulfill a person’s daily caloric requirement, higher than other resilient
foods. This translates to a cost per unit of protein of ~$7–
40/kg protein, or $0.40-2.40 for a daily protein requirement
of 60 grams.

Further research is needed to characterize the potential,
cost, and feasibility of rapid mass deployment of bivalve cultivation technologies for ASRS and GCIL response. Other
relevant questions include: how bivalves would be affected
by reduced phytoplankton productivity during a nuclear
winter, where they could be grown, and whether they could
be co-produced with seaweed effectively during ASRS.


_**Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA)**_
IMTA comprises the cultivation of fed species of sea animals
(such as finfish or shrimp) along with extractive species,
such as suspension-feeding (e.g., mussels and oysters) as well
as deposit-feeding (e.g., sea-cucumbers and sea-urchins)
invertebrates, and seaweed that are fertilized by the organic
and inorganic waste from the fed species (Buck et al. 2018).
The fed species are kept in enclosed netted areas, the
suspension-feeding invertebrates and macroalgae are grown
on moored submerged longlines, and the deposit-feeding
invertebrates are kept in cages on the seafloor (Tzachor,
Richards, and Holt 2021).

IMTA can be implemented in temperate waters and has
been demonstrated in the waters of Canada, Chile, China,
France, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, the
United Kingdom (mostly Scotland), and the U.S. (Barrington,
Chopin, and Robinson 2009). It has potential for wide-scale
use since between 25 million and 31 million km [2] of the
ocean are considered to be environmentally suitable for both
finfish and molluscs (Oyinlola et al. 2018). The pioneering
IMTA system in Sanggou Bay, China, boasts a biomass production yield of 2,400 tonne/km [2] /year (Fang et al. 2016)—
even at a fraction of this yield, an area of 25 million km [2]
should suffice to cover global calorie requirements, although
production may only be economic in the subset of this area
closest to the coast. During an ASRS, water temperatures
would change, so the coasts of the tropics could become
more temperate, making it a more viable option for IMTA.
Small scale implementations of near shore versions of IMTA
systems are relatively simple to construct (Parappurathu
et al. 2023), and progress is being made toward making
IMTA relatively effective, low-investment, and lowmaintenance (Resende et al. 2021). Presently, China is the
world leader in IMTA, generating more than 40% of its
mariculture production of 14 million tonnes (including
shells) of shellfish and 25 million tonnes (wet weight) of
seaweeds (FAO 2022a). Incentives for developing IMTA are
lacking, but changes to current regulations and policies, such
as requiring aquaculture operations to internalize nutrient
discharge costs, would incentivize the development of IMTA
from the pilot scale to the commercial scale in new regions
(Chopin 2013). Future research on the potential, cost, and
feasibility of rapid mass deployment of bivalve and seaweed
cultivation in ASRS and GCIL should include IMTA.


_**Food without agriculture: high-tech food solutions for**_
_**ASRS**_

Modern industrial technologies such as fermentation, biosynthesis, and chemical synthesis enable enormous potential
for the production of food virtually independent of environmental conditions, using CO2, biomass, or hydrocarbons as
raw materials. Developed in the last century, these methods
can not only produce all 3 macronutrients (see Figure 9),
but also key micronutrients such as vitamins, essential amino
acids and essential fatty acids, especially through precision
fermentation. These technologies and their application for
food production, especially in conditions of extreme agricultural catastrophe such as an ASRS, are discussed in-depth in



the review article complementing the current one by (García
Martínez, Behr, and Denkenberger 2024).

Further research is needed on most of these technologies,
but at least two of these are particularly promising for helping prevent a global catastrophic food failure: 1) the production of single cell protein from methane (e.g., in natural gas
or biogas) can be an affordable, widespread, high-quality
source of proteins and even some fats and carbohydrates in
catastrophic scenarios (García Martínez et al. 2022); and 2)
the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to sugar (Throup
et al. 2022). The latter could be used not only as an affordable caloric contribution in ASRS—especially when obtained
through rapid repurposing of paper mills and second generation biorefineries—but also as a platform for precision fermentation to obtain all kinds of essential nutrients
fundamental for human health, to prevent malnutrition. Of
note is the capacity to produce micronutrients which could
be scarce in an ASRS, such as essential fatty acids and certain vitamins. Vitamin C is already produced industrially at
140,000 tonnes/year, and lysine at 2.2 million tonnes/year
(García Martínez, Behr, and Denkenberger 2024).

In an agricultural catastrophe, these technologies could
serve multiple purposes: 1) to be used as food ingredients to
counter agricultural yield reduction if needed such as in
major crisis scenarios (e.g., ASRS); 2) to secure the animal
feed supply required to keep animal agriculture sectors
afloat; and 3) as an intermediate for strategic production, for
example, cellulosic sugar could be used as a fermentation
platform for strategic production of nutrients (vitamins,
omega fats, etc.) or even biofuels if a fuel shortage is
involved. For example, converting the entire global production of roundwood and agricultural residues to sugars could
produce an amount of calories equivalent to the entire global
population’s caloric requirement, at an estimated cost of
$0.43-0.91 to provide a person’s daily caloric requirement
(Throup et al. 2022). Converting the entire global production of natural gas to food through single cell protein production results in nearly 3 times the caloric requirement of
the global population, or 9–15 times the protein requirement, with models indicating that fulfilling the global protein requirement using this technology could be done in a
few years—at an estimated cost of $1.65-2.81 to provide a
person’s daily caloric requirement or $0.15-0.25 for the daily
protein requirement (García Martínez et al. 2022). Paraffins
derived from oil could be converted into synthetic fats to
produce 8–17% of the global caloric requirements at an estimated cost of $0.74-2.71 to provide a person’s daily caloric
requirement (García Martínez, Alvarado, and Denkenberger
2022; García Martínez, Behr, and Denkenberger 2024). Other
methods of this kind are discussed in Appendix B.

To increase agricultural catastrophe resilience and technology deployment speed, investments can be made in nonagricultural resilient foods, including constructing a fast
pilot (24/7 construction) methane single cell protein (García
Martínez et al. 2022) and lignocellulosic sugar production
plant, and pilot repurposing facilities like paper factories for
sugar conversion (Throup et al. 2022). Further repurposing
potential analyses should be done for other industries and
high-tech industrial foods, such as for repurposing breweries

license, no changes made). Other relevant pathways (not pictured) include the conversion of biomass to carbohydrates through methods other than gasification,
the conversion of those sugars to proteins, fats, and essential micronutrients through fermentation, or the cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms.



to SCP production. Future research could also focus on process development, food safety, and product development
research on converting other widespread nonagricultural
inputs into food, and establishing safety and quality standards. Finally, forming public-private partnerships with pioneering companies could offer insights into scaling up
production effectively, and leveraging current commercial
trials in various feed markets to potentially achieve economies of production scale similar to the learning curves seen
in renewable energy (García Martínez, Behr, and
Denkenberger 2024). Lastly, for each type of high-tech solution efforts can be made to make open-source small-scale
systems that can be mass replicated to provide distributed
resilient food production.


**Policy work on resilient food solutions and related**
**interventions**

In 2021, the United Nations Secretary General made a call
for “defining, identifying, assessing and managing existential
risks” as part of the UN Common Agenda. These risks may
comprise the majority of the risk threatening modern societies, but they are rarely considered as such in governmental
risk management policies (Boyd and Wilson 2023b).
Addressing tail risks of food systems is a neglected priority
of our time in line with this thinking, and public policy
must be applied in tandem with resilient food technology
research and development to mitigate global catastrophic



risk and existential risk related to food systems. Various
groups are currently working to produce such policies.

Reports scoping out national risk preparedness plans to
prevent a food failure in case of an ASRS have been produced for several countries, such as for Argentina (Ulloa
Ruiz et al. 2024), by the Alliance to Feed the Earth in
Disasters (ALLFED) and the Observatorio de Riesgos
Catastróficos Globales (ORCG), and for New Zealand (Boyd,
Payne, et al. 2023). There is historical precedent for this type
of risk preparedness plans against other high-impact
low-probability hazards, both natural (e.g., tsunamis) and
anthropogenic (e.g., nuclear plant accidents). These efforts
have called for establishing the national capability to deploy
the resilient food interventions described in the current
work, as well as complementary ASRS interventions to
maintain equitable food access (rationing, producer subsidies, price controls, food vouchers), and highlighting the
importance of international cooperation, water management,
flexible legislation to reduce food-based biofuel production
quotas, and food waste reduction in ASRS. Figure 10 shows
the estimated increase in food production in Argentina for
increasing levels of implementation of disaster response policies including resilient foods, demonstrating how they could
not only potentially avoid a national famine but vastly
increase food production in the region (Ulloa Ruiz et al.
2024), reducing the risk of conflict and refugee crises.

(Boyd, Payne, et al. 2023) have presented an extensive set
of recommendations for New Zealand to be used as the


**Figure 10.** Estimated increase in food production in Argentina in terms of people fed for increasing levels of implementation of relevant disaster response
policies, including resilient foods. The first bar is current net food production,
and the rest represent 150 Tg ASRS conditions with increasing adaptations from
left to right—meaning the last column includes not just increased area and
greenhouses but also rationing, redirection, and resilient food deployment.

basis of a plan to weather a nuclear war between foreign
powers, discussing not only how to prevent a nuclear
winter-induced food failure in the region but also focusing
on maintaining provision of other critical infrastructure
needs (energy, water, transport, communications) in the face
of other extreme consequences that may arise in the scenario, such as a loss of international trade and coordination.
Among these, the report contains many which are applicable
to any other country: development of a National Food
Security Strategy that includes these shocks (vulnerability
assessments, quantification and supply of food, water and
energy needs, infrastructure needs), development of plans
for fuel management in catastrophe (supply, rationing, and
deployment of fuel alternatives like biofuel), targeted investments (strategic stockpiles of seeds, agricultural inputs, and
critical parts for machinery, information infrastructure for
dissemination of contingency plans, biorefining capacity),
establishing collaboration agreements with neighboring
nations in case of global food crises, and assessment of the
local cost-effectiveness of these resilience options.

Finally, Glomseth has called for ASRS preparedness in
Norway, suggesting a cross-sectoral collaboration between
the Norwegian food and trade ministries, civil protection
agency, and Nuclear Safety Authority (Glomseth 2024).

National contingency plans can be developed to maintain
the population’s basic needs even in the case of a GCIL,
incorporating a “reverse roadmap” that describes how to
temporarily return to less advanced agriculture, water provision and energy systems. These could draw from historical
case studies such as the example of Cuba in the post-Soviet
Collapse, as highlighted by Boyd, Payne, et al. (2023), whose
numerous recommendations for contingency planning are
also relevant to GCIL planning. Agronomic research in current subsistence agricultural production systems could also



be relevant to this effort. It should be noted that no historical case studies provide quite the necessary context for this
work, which is a challenge of this type of extrapolative
research.


**Discussion and future work**


_**Deep uncertainty and scenario characterization work**_

The field of research on resilient foods deals with mitigating
the impact of a range of extreme catastrophic scenarios with
limited historical precedents. While scenario characterization
is not the focus of the current work, it is important to clarify the presence of fundamental uncertainties involved. There
remains significant uncertainty on the risk distribution and
degrees of severity to be expected, both for ASRS and GCIL,
as well as the probability of the scenarios materializing from
different hazards (Denkenberger et al. 2021; Denkenberger
et al. 2022). For example, the risk distribution of ASRS scenarios is not well studied, with milder scenarios more likely
than more severe scenarios, and with varying degrees of
severity and probability depending on origin (volcanic,
nuclear, or asteroid/comet). Another example is how, for
nuclear ASRS, uncertainty remains in myriad factors such as
the probability distribution of the number of nuclear weapons likely to be used in the conflict, the types of targets and
their flammability, and the likelihood of generated
sunlight-blocking particles reaching the stratosphere (Hess
2021; Pinsent and Tan 2024), to name some. For GCIL,
there also remains uncertainty as to how likely the related
hazards are (e.g., HEMP, solar storms, cyberattacks, pandemics) and what degree of supply chain disruption they would
entail (Denkenberger et al. 2021; Denkenberger et al. 2022).
For both ASRS and GCIL, a considerable uncertainty is to
what degree reduced coordination and cooperation may hinder food responses regardless of prior preparation, and how
much the development and knowledge of resilient foods can
prevent these instabilities from becoming unmanageable. In
other words: is there a degree of shock at which societal
systems collapse no matter how much preparation is in
place, perhaps due to breakdown of social order? Or can a
sufficiently fast and effective response prevent this?

All of these considerations and more are fundamental to
mounting an effective catastrophe response. The degree
and type of the shock determines which of the interventions should be prioritized. Consider different types of scenarios: 1) a mild ASRS with minimal supply disruption, in
which the best move is probably to prioritize interventions
aimed at maintaining food trade and increasing food conservation, such as redirecting crops away from animal agriculture and biofuel production; 2) a severe nuclear winter,
which would require a much more comprehensive food
resilience response with varying degrees of deployment of
many or all of the foods described in this work across all
levels of technological sophistication; 3) a scenario with
both severe ASRS and GCIL which would severely constrain the response to food conservation and ASRS-resilient
foods based on simple technologies (see the top right


quadrant of Figure 5, and for more discussion of this scenario see (Denkenberger et al. 2017)).

This is why it is important to have a portfolio of resilient foods ready to be deployed, allowing people to
respond and provide enough food given the large variety
of possible future shocks—this variety of options, known
as response diversity, is the basis for adaptive behavior
(Walker et al. 2023). In addition, further research is
needed to bound these risks, which would inform both
which interventions are the most important for response
across all hazards, and what level of resilience investment
is warranted to insure people against them. Finally, uncertainties around the flexibility of markets and nations to
redirect resources and engage in response interventions
inside and outside of their borders warrant future work on
resource distribution such as integrated models (Rivers
et al. 2024) and economic analyses of resilient foods
responses in a variety of scenarios.


_**Future work on resilient food research and development**_

A long list of future research and development areas have
been proposed in the sections of each food production
method. This section focuses on summarizing at a high level
and discussing additional ideas not focused on one particular food.

Basic research work is still needed on food production
methods, production ramp-up, and technology deployment,
as well as research on the nutrition and safety of some of
the more novel foods. For example, some resilient foods
would benefit from conducting food safety and nutritional
studies which verify that the novel foods created from these
technologies are safe and nutritional for human consumption in the long term, such as the different types of leaf
protein concentrate, some seaweeds, or some novel industrial
foods. In addition, basic analysis of key metrics to characterize the potential of various food production methods
(cost, speed, and feasibility of mass scale deployment in
catastrophe conditions) is still missing, such as for expanding planted area, krill fishing, bivalve cultivation, IMTA, leaf
protein concentrates, duckweed, foraged resources, and various technologies for industrial production of food without
agriculture. A technical readiness level analysis of all resilient foods could be made for both industrial and
small-distributed scale. For those with a lower technology
readiness level, optimizing existing production processes
may yet be needed. Research on decentralized food production would also be beneficial, including the production of
open-source engineering designs for food production equipment, and the study of the potential of ramping up urban
agriculture.

More ambitiously, a large plant breeding or genetic engineering program could be launched to try to enhance ASRS
resilience traits in staple crops, such as tolerance to frost,
drought, and lower sunlight. However, the multigenic nature
of these traits could make it technically challenging to
achieve considerable improvements while maintaining high
yields. If ASRS-resilient but lower yielding staple crops were



developed, they would not replace regular high-yielding
varieties in global agriculture. In this case, stockpiles of
ASRS resilient seeds could be maintained as a backup, but
they would need to be of considerable size in order to
deploy at sufficient speed to counter ASRS-induced losses,
requiring significant investment. Considerable uncertainty
remains on this option, requiring further research.

Finally, and most importantly, further development and
piloting of resilient food technologies would be conducive to
a faster response, through rapid deployment including fast
construction and repurposing, as described throughout
Section “Resilient food solutions”. Future research will focus
on analyzing in more depth the technology readiness level of
resilient food solutions and what research and development
is needed to improve it.


_**Future work on critical infrastructure resilience for GCRs**_

There is a long list of research projects that would support
food resilience and other critical infrastructure resilience
against global catastrophic risks such as an ASRS or GCIL.
From (Boyd, Payne, et al. 2023) several items for further
research in the field are clear, which could be applied to
any region of the world for food resilience, perhaps funded
by the local government. These include: 1) determining
logistics of supplying minimal fuel for agricultural equipment, and minimal agricultural inputs (especially if these
are normally imported), 2) quantifying current food production and distribution under nuclear winter and zero
trade/scarce fuel conditions, and 3) investigating the possibility of rapidly switching from diesel to electrification or
biofuels for agriculture and supply chains in nations dependent on imported fuel to respond to a trade breakdown.
Denkenberger et al. have proposed research on rapid
deployment of many interventions for resilience to GCIL,
including: 1) burning wood from landfills to provide an
alternative to synthetic fertilizer; 2) rapid deployment of
nitrogen fixing crops including legumes (peas, beans, etc.);
3) nonindustrial pest control; 4) low-tech alternatives to
current fuels in supply chains, such as biomass gasifier systems (Nelson, Turchin, and Denkenberger 2024; Vennard,
Pearce, and Denkenberger 2024) or retrofitting appropriate
vessels to use wind power; 5) retrofitting widespread technology such as household ovens for space heating (Jose
et al. 2024); and 6) alternative communication systems
such as EMP-hardened satellites or a network of shortwave
radios (Denkenberger et al. 2017; Denkenberger et al.
2021). Backup energy generation plans for ASRS scenarios
should be researched, considering increased future renewable energy penetration (e.g., rapid solar photovoltaic
deployments underway), since a severe ASRS could reduce
combined wind and solar energy generation by up to 59%
(Varne et al. 2024). Interventions for providing other critical needs such as water distribution, sewage treatment, and
healthcare should be studied. Finally, investing in satellite
monitoring capabilities for soot or particulate emissions
would help characterize the magnitude of shocks and expedite resilient food responses when needed.


_**Future work on GCR policy**_

At the national level, every government can develop a comprehensive National Food Security Strategy that tackles risks
impacting food supply and corresponding resilience measures (Rivers et al. 2024; Boyd, Payne, et al. 2023; Ulloa Ruiz
et al. 2024). They can also implement legislation for in-depth
analysis of GCRs such as the Global Catastrophic Risk
Mitigation Act of the USA (Sepasspour 2023), incorporate
global agricultural catastrophes to their national risk assessments (Boyd and Wilson 2023b), develop government protocols that facilitate rapid adaptation of the food system and
efficient scaling-up of resilient food solutions (i.e., response
plans), and stimulate investment in the research and development of mitigation interventions as described in this
work. This would all be done most effectively through an
all-hazards policy approach (Sepasspour 2023; Boyd, Payne,
et al. 2023). An impactful first step would be the formation
of a national committee or task force to make recommendations on improving preparedness and response to global
agricultural catastrophes, and identifying national food system vulnerabilities. Community consultations (surveys, citizen assemblies, Polis-type engagement) may also be useful
(Boyd, Payne, et al. 2023).

At the international level, work could involve advocacy
on multilateral resolutions that increase resilience to global
catastrophic food failures, for example: UN proposals on
how countries ought to collaborate and maintain trade in a
catastrophe, share intellectual property in areas of resilient
food, or make adjustments to international rules. Jehn et al.
estimated that the unequally distributed food production
disruptions in ASRS would require radical changes in trading partners, with most countries losing 50–100% of their
imports (Jehn, Gajewski, et al. 2024). This transition could
be eased through pre-catastrophe international trade agreements, but national actions may differ from international
agreements in such crisis situations, especially in the absence
of enforcement mechanisms (Hoffman et al. 2022), which
complicates multilateral advocacy.


**Concluding remarks**

Catastrophes such as nuclear war or volcanic eruption could
trigger a breakdown in the environmental conditions on
which global food production depends (sunlight, temperature, precipitation), potentially reducing it by up to 90%. A
collapse of critical global infrastructures, perhaps triggered
by nuclear electromagnetic pulse, solar storm or extreme
pandemic, could reduce crop production by 35–48% due to
lack of agricultural inputs. Future developments in AI might
facilitate similar catastrophes through coordinated
cyber-attacks, or biotechnological development of new highly
contagious and deadly viruses or new plant pathogens. At
present, the world is ill-equipped to deal with these scenarios: food reserves could be depleted in a matter of months.

This work reviews the field of resilient food adaptations
to these global catastrophic food shock scenarios, divided in
four categories: 1) food conservation solutions (prioritizing
crops away from animal feed and biofuels for human food,



reducing food waste); 2) land-based solutions such as optimizing grass- and plant-residue–fed animal agriculture, relocating resilient crops, greenhouses, expanding cropland, and
producing leaf protein; 3) water-based solutions (duckweed,
algae, fishing, bivalves); and 4) high-tech industrial solutions
for the production of food without agriculture. Included are
both novel foods selected for their resilience and affordability in the face of catastrophe (single cell proteins, lignocellulosic sugar, leaf protein, etc.), as well as mature food
production methods whose scalability is well known: crop
relocation, ruminants, greenhouses, seaweed, fishing, bivalves,
and mushrooms. Extensive recommendations for future
research and development include rapid deployment trials
and 24/7 construction pilots, production ramp-up and economic analyses, and food safety studies. The policy literature
advocates for integrating these interventions into disaster
preparedness. Recommendations include incorporating global
catastrophes into national risk assessments and food strategies, developing national preparedness plans, forming task
forces for global catastrophe resilience, and investing in
rapid response capabilities.

Deep uncertainty, however, remains regarding the risk
distribution of these hazards. Effective catastrophe response
depends on the specific scenario, with varying strategies
needed depending on its severity and specifics. Thus, developing a diverse portfolio of resilience interventions and a
better understanding of the risks is crucial for ensuring food
security in the face of global catastrophes.

**Appendix A: Other minor resilient foods**


_**A.1 Other cellulose-digesting animals, e.g., insects**_
_**and shipworms**_

Some insects (i.e., certain beetle and fly larvae, as well as termites) can also live on grass or agricultural residues (Martin
et al. 1997; Ramzy et al. 2022). Some mollusks, such as shipworms—which have historically been consumed in some regions—can live on wood, much like termites. Insects reproduce
extremely quickly, can be densely packed, and are amenable to
decentralized food production from household food waste
(Denkenberger and Pearce 2014). However, to the best of our
knowledge there exist no sizable farming operations of insects
fed on lignocellulosic biomass yet, and the shipworm farming
industry is still under development (Willer and Aldridge 2020).
On the other hand, ruminants are widespread and have been an
established food source since prehistoric times. The advantage
of insects is they have somewhat more efficient feed ratios than
mammals, but their challenges include the low societal acceptance of their consumption in some cultures (Ros-Baró et al.
2022). There is also a difficulty to scale up to meet significant


production (Denkenberger and Pearce 2014) in a cost-effective
way (Denkenberger et al. 2019), since current methods for mass
production remain expensive (Morales-Ramos et al. 2020).

For example, mealworms ( _Tenebrio Molitor_ larvae), a type
of insect commonly studied for mass production operations,
are being sold on the market by various companies at prices around ~$8/kg dry, equivalent to ~$4 to fulfill a person’s
daily caloric requirement. They have some capacity to digest
cellulose (Li et al. 2016), but do not have the right microbiota to produce the cellulase enzyme that allows other animals such as ruminants and xylophages (wood eaters, e.g.,
termites, shipworms, gribbles) to break down cellulose into
carbohydrates. Mealworms are comparable to poultry in
terms of cost and feed efficiency, both having typical values
of around 1.5-2.5 kg of weight gained per kg of feed consumed (Cassidy et al. 2013; Bordiean et al. 2020). Work on
automation of insect production may reduce costs to an acceptable level, but highly automated systems could be harder to deploy in an ASRS, or impossible in a GCIL.

Considerable uncertainty thus remains on the potential of
these animals as a resilient food source. Some research exists on rearing or harvesting termites or shipworms, but the
literature does not have in-depth analyses of the feasibility
and cost of producing food-grade products at scale, which
could be addressed by future research. Trials on feeding agricultural residues to insects, similar to those proposed in
the previous section for dairy cattle, would be useful to see
if they would outperform ruminants in terms of calories in
versus calories out. The usefulness of this research for catastrophe response is limited by the existence of potentially
better options for mass deployment in this class, however,
such as certain types of ruminants for ASRS and GCIL response, or single cell proteins for ASRS, which can be produced without consuming any human edible food at lower
cost and are also high in protein (García Martínez et al.
2022).


_**A.2 Foraging**_

Many foods grow in the wild, including garlic, nettle, fungi,
seaweed, fruits, and nuts, which can help feed the population in
a global catastrophe. Tropical wild edible plants that are traditionally foraged have been proposed as viable for foraging following an ASRS, for both immediate consumption through foraging and for cultivation, such as konjac, wild cassava, vegetable
amaranths, and safou (Winstead and Jacobson 2022).

Earthworms are another potentially foraged food which
can be obtained through either simple manual means (e.g.,
charming/grunting) or through more complex means such
as mechanical sieving, chemical expellants, or electroshocking (Miller et al. 2024). Earthworm density is extremely
high in various regions of the world (Phillips et al. 2019),
and the doubling time of an earthworm population is 60–
70 days (Sinha 2009). The extraction of earthworms is very
labor intensive, however, taking a median 6 h to obtain a
person’s daily protein needs, making it too expensive in regions without a very high earthworm density. The median
cost to fulfill a person’s daily calorie requirement is $185,
but could be as low as $32 in regions with high earthworm
density and low labor costs (Miller et al. 2024), which is
still much less affordable than the most promising resilient
foods. Another concern with foraging earthworms is that in
the event of an ASRS, colder soil temperatures and reduced



precipitation may make foraging more difficult. In addition,
processing earthworms to be safe for human consumption is
technologically intensive (Miller et al. 2024).

Although only a small percentage of the global population
still forage for food, the availability of forageable food is still
accessible evidenced by the prevalence of the modern foraging
movement (Rickard 2022). A downside to foraging is that it
requires knowledge of what foods are edible and which are not
(or are poisonous) in order to be practical, and this knowledge
is quite rare. There has been extensive development of smartphone applications that enable identification of plants which
could be used to improve foraging potential, but this still involves risk. More analysis is needed to ascertain the potential of
foraging and the means to leverage it as a catastrophe resilience
intervention.


_**A.3 Freshwater pond plants, e.g., duckweed**_

Lemnaceae are the smallest flowering plants on Earth, and
could constitute another water-based resilient food. More commonly referred to as duckweeds or water lentils, they grow in
small freshwater bodies and float on the surface. Due to their
fast growth rate and nutritional composition, duckweeds are
used in numerous sectors including food, pharmaceuticals, and
phytoremediation (Baek, Saeed, and Choi 2021). Duckweed is
rich in protein (20–35%) and omega 3 fatty acids, and has been
historically consumed as food in some South East Asian countries (Appenroth et al., 2017). It has also been approved as a
novel food by the European Food Safety Authority (Turck et al.
2023). The global duckweed market is estimated to currently be
worth $76 million USD and is projected to grow to $195.4 million by 2033 (Choudhury 2023). Another freshwater pond plant
called _Azolla_ has been suggested as a potential resilient food for
similar reasons and potential advantages over duckweed
(Winstead et al. 2024), such as lower nitrogen requirement
through nitrogen fixation and higher cold and temperature tolerance, but they are not currently produced in significant quantities.

Duckweed grows exceptionally fast, producing up to 10,000
tonnes dry matter per km [2] (Cao, Fourounjian, and Wang 2018).
Rubisco, a protein that can be derived in large quantities from
duckweed, is highly digestible, has a complete nutritional profile, and has numerous beneficial culinary properties (F. G.
Pearce and Brunke 2023). For these reasons, companies such as
Plantible, Rubisco Proteins, Rubisco Foods, DryGro, Urban
Tiller, Sustainable Panet, and Microterra are working on the
mass commercialization of Rubisco proteins from duckweed for
use in plant-based foods. Freshwater pond plants can be grown
on raceway ponds, either outdoors (lower capital requirement),
indoors (more control over cultivation conditions), or a combination of both.

Duckweed is resilient to a variety of severe environmental
conditions, and it shows promise for extreme food catastrophe
resilience thanks to its capacity to grow in low light conditions
(i.e., below 25 μmol m [−2] s [−1] ) (Femeena, Roman, and Brennan
2023)—which is even lower than those in a severe ASRS—as
well as for its simplicity to cultivate which is relevant to GCIL
scenarios. The growth of some species is hindered at temperatures lower than 17 °C, but in general they can grow in temperatures as low as 1–3 °C and some “even continue to grow
during the winter months” (Vymazal 2008). Although under
very low light and temperature conditions (below 5 °C and
25 μmol m [−2] s [−1] ) the growth of _Lemna minor_ was reported to be


minimal, good growth rates were achieved at 15 °C (Femeena,
Roman, and Brennan 2023). The shorter growing seasons in
ASRS would complicate duckweed cultivation, but greenhouse
systems would alleviate this.

Key challenges of duckweed production are that large biomass volumes are required, the extraction and fractionation
processes are inefficient, and purification can be costly (F. G.
Pearce and Brunke 2023). Other challenges include: design of
cultivation structures, determination of operational conditions,
choice of medium type, selection of the duckweed species and
lineage, manipulation of the microbiome, and development of
harvesting technologies (Coughlan et al. 2022). Economic and
scale-up models are needed to characterize the potential of
duckweed as a resilient food source for global catastrophes.


**Appendix B: Notable interventions not included as**
**resilient foods**

There are some notable food production methods that have
been discussed in the relevant literature, but which were not
included in the list of resilient foods. One notable example
are non-cellulose digesting animals, which currently make a
considerable contribution to diets globally, mostly in the
form of grain-fed pigs and chickens. (Denkenberger and
Pearce 2014) discussed the possibility of rearing small,
quickly reproducing animals such as chickens, rabbits, rats,
detritivorous arthropods and fish whose production could
be scaled quickly given the right feeds. As described in
Section “Ruminants fed on grass and agricultural residues”,
however, these are generally dependent on human-edible
crops that may be better directly consumed by humans in a
catastrophe, and thus cannot be considered as a truly resilient primary food source. Although rats and pigs have some
capacity to partially digest cellulose through their internal
microbiota and rabbits are monogastric hindgut fermenters
that can survive on fresh grass only, majority grass feeds are
not used in commercial operations because these animals
are not efficient enough at digesting lignocellulose. There
may, however, be cases where it is locally efficient to do this
as a form of upcycling low nutrition crops, food waste, or
partially decomposed leaves into highly nutritious meats.
Rabbits are already harvested at scale in many countries and
can be more feed-efficient than chicken meat production—
but not egg production (Meyer et al. 2021).

Another notable example is the application of artificial light,
including technologies such as vertical farming of vegetables, or
growing microalgae in photobioreactors, which is the most efficient artificial light option (Alvarado et al. 2021). While it may
at first appear to be a reasonable alternative in scenarios like
ASRS where photosynthetic crops are severely affected, it is
generally prohibitively expensive compared to alternatives, at a
cost of hundreds of dollars to fulfill a person’s daily calorie re


quirement (Denkenberger et al. 2019). There exist technologies
for the production of food that are significantly more efficient
at converting electricity into calories, such as single cell proteins
obtained through water electrolysis using CO2 (García Martínez,
Behr, and Denkenberger 2024). There may, however, be some
uses of artificial light which might make economic sense on the
margin in the framework of a resilient food response to ASRS,
such as the strategic application of some artificial light in greenhouses to improve overall yields (Alvarado et al. 2020). There
may also be some catastrophic scenarios warranting the application of artificial light for food production locally, such as high
latitude regions with large electricity production in ASRS if international trade is not possible. As indoor growing becomes
more efficient, future research may be warranted in the economic viability of this pathway.

There exist myriad other processes to produce food independently of sunlight and other environmental conditions
through industrial technologies in addition to those highlighted in section “Policy work on resilient food solutions and related interventions”, which have not been included here due to
uncertainties in their potential as a resilient food technology
compared with alternatives, including single cell proteins from
hydrogen feedstock produced by electrolysis or biomass gasification (García Martínez, Egbejimba, et al. 2021), or from other feedstocks such as peat, methanol, paraffins, gas oil, and
plastics; as well as methods to produce food involving microbial electrosynthesis (García Martínez, Brown, et al. 2021), _in_
_vitro_ BioTransformation, or chemical synthesis of carbohydrates and carboxylic acids (García Martínez, Behr, and
Denkenberger 2024). Production of lignocellulosic sugar, which
is promising at a large scale for ASRS response, can also be
successfully done at a small household scale (Siva and Anderson
2023; Siva and Anderson 2024). It may not, however, be practicable due to the complexity of sourcing sufficient enzymes for
efficient sugar extraction, although cellulase-producing fungal
species might help realize this at a community level. In addition, the household process would need to demonstrate its
food safety, for example, with sufficiently low levels of toxins
such as furfural.

It is also worth noting that several interventions for mitigation of a global catastrophic food failure were not included because they are outside of the scope of this work. One example
are speculative geoengineering response interventions that have
been proposed for mitigation of ASRS, such as interventions
that may prevent or mollify supervolcanic eruptions
(Denkenberger and Blair 2018), or intentional release of fluorinated gasses (Xu et al. 2023). Another example are policy efforts for GCR prevention, such as nuclear diplomacy, because of
this article’s focus on response and resilience. Prevention of a
nuclear war or other types of attacks (e.g., digital, biological)
leading to a global catastrophe is unambiguously the best outcome and should continue to be pursued in parallel to food
resilience efforts.

### 1 Abstract

2 Food systems today face interconnected, systemic risks that could culminate in widespread
3 disruptions triggering extreme global famine, in addition to neglected extreme risks. This paper
4 introduces the concept of Global Catastrophic Food Failure (GCFF) to describe such scenarios;
5 where food shortages overwhelm response capacities of governments and private sectors,
6 necessitating extraordinary interventions. While the exact likelihood of GCFFs is uncertain,
7 consequences would be profound. Currently, GCFF is a blind spot requiring research and policy
8 efforts to strengthen food systems’ resilience and capacity to sustain humanity.

### 9 Main

10 History is full of examples where catastrophic events like war, disease or climate shifts led to
11 local disruptions of the food system. This in turn triggered famine and often a collapse of local
12 population numbers [[1]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?7aZYZm) . Today’s food security is strongly reliant on global food and energy trade,
13 as many countries are net food importers [[2,3]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?rPS1HI) . This means that many events that would impact
14 humanity’s food system today could be felt globally. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and
15 geopolitical tensions like the Russia-Ukraine conflict have underscored the vulnerability of global
16 food systems [[3,4]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?YOEPFB) . The current global food system is precariously balanced, prone to major
17 disruptions that could trigger catastrophic food shortages greater than 5% of global calorie
18 supply. Reliance on intensive industrial methods and global supply-chains has locked the food
19 system into unstable self-undermining dynamics that disrupt yields and supply chains [[5,6]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?nbDsSC) .
20 Dependence on global supply chains means disruptions in one region can cascade, impacting
21 food availability and prices elsewhere. Current research on the food system has mostly focused
22 on specific risks separately (e.g., climate change or trade shock), so we propose a new concept
23 to integrate different types of risk in an interconnected manner.


24 We introduce the term 'Global Catastrophic Food Failure' (GCFF) as a type of global catastrophic
25 risk, to help bring together different strands of research that are all focused on ensuring food
26 availability on a global scale. The benefits of adopting this new term include:


27   - Highlighting worst-case scenarios: GCFF emphasizes the need for robust contingency
28 planning by considering catastrophic events that could drastically reduce global food
29 production and supply
30   - Catalyzing proactive risk management: GCFF shifts the focus from reactive crisis
31 management to anticipatory resilience-building by identifying vulnerabilities and
32 implementing risk reduction measures, including through policymaking.


33

### 34 What is a Global Catastrophic Food Failure?

35 We define a Global Catastrophic Food Failure (GCFF) as an extreme, widespread food supply
36 shortage beyond the capacity of national governments, international institutions, and the
37 private sector to manage through ordinary means. The shortage occurs in a few years or less,
38 triggered, either by an exceptional natural or human-caused event such as a volcanic eruption
39 or a nuclear attack, or by a more gradual systemic crisis.


40 A GCFF is characterized by a severe reduction in the availability of staple foods such as grains,
41 legumes, and vegetables, leading to a caloric deficit of at least 5% of global food supply or access.
42 A GCFF would be identified by a combination of factors, such as: rapid and sustained increase in
43 global food prices, widespread reports of food shortages and hunger across multiple regions,
44 depletion of strategic food reserves without prospects for replenishment, breakdown of normal
45 food supply chains and distribution networks, and inadequacy of emergency food assistance to
46 meet the scale of need. Without effective and timely intervention, a GCFF could result in
47 widespread starvation, causing tremendous suffering, loss of life, and severe disruptions to
48 national governments, international relations, and social and global security.

### 50 Defining Characteristics and Elements of GCFF

51

52 The catastrophic nature of a GCFF is defined by the extreme severity of its effects. In the
53 following we outline a range of criteria which we think cover this severity:


54 Rapid Onset: a GCFF would occur suddenly and with little warning. This is important to
55 differentiate a GCFF from catastrophes that allow for significant time to implement
56 adaptations within regular coping capacity, or could be mostly resolved by using existing food
57 stocks. A GCFF would, in expectation, be triggered by abrupt events and exacerbated by an
58 abrupt shock or stressor event that triggers a rapid onset cascade of failures across multiple
59 components of the system.


60 Extended Duration: While abruptness is a key factor in the onset of a GCFF, the longevity of the
61 crisis is equally crucial. Short-term shocks lasting less than a year might be buffered by global
62 trade and food stockpiles. However, a GCFF is characterized by its potential to persist for
63 multiple years, severely testing humanity's limited resilience to prolonged periods of low food
64 production.


65 Limited Resilience: Chronic food security issues, while serious, often allow for some level of
66 adaptation and resilience-building over time. Communities and nations can implement long67 term strategies to mitigate chronic food shortages. In contrast, the abrupt, extreme, and
68 protracted nature of GCFFs leaves little room for preparation or adaptation, making them
69 much harder to address effectively.


70 Extreme Magnitude: GCFFs are defined by their extreme and unparalleled magnitude. Since
71 the industrial revolution we have not seen a global drop in globally available food on such a
72 scale. These events have the potential to affect not just one region or a particular group of
73 people, but to have global repercussions. The scale of food scarcity and its impact on
74 populations worldwide is significantly greater in a GCFF compared to chronic food security
75 issues.


76 High Humanitarian Impact: GCFFs result in an immediate and profound humanitarian crisis.
77 They can lead to widespread famine, malnutrition, and death on a massive scale. The urgency
78 of responding to prevent such a crisis is paramount due to the potential loss of life and
79 suffering it entails.


80 Global Interconnectedness: In today's interconnected world, disruptions in one part of the
81 globe can quickly affect others [[8]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Kk2sR8) . GCFFs can arise when a global catastrophe triggers a domino
82 effect, impacting supply chains, economies, and geopolitical stability, further exacerbating
83 their acute nature. The global food trade system seems to be especially vulnerable to such
84 systemic risks.


85 Our emphasis on GCFF does not diminish the importance of addressing other food disasters that
86 do not meet the scale and severity level of GCFF. More common events including localized
87 droughts, floods or conflicts can have significant and far-reaching impacts, warranting robust
88 scientific, agricultural, and societal attention. Instead, we strive to bring increased focus to
89 extraordinary risks that have received insufficient study and action despite their potential harm
90 to humanity.

##### 91 Causal dynamics of a GCFF

92 Figure 1 presents an event tree diagram that maps out potential cascading impacts and feedback
93 loops that could arise from a large-scale volcanic eruption, leading to a Global Catastrophic Food
94 Failure (GCFF).


95


96 **Figure 1. Event-tree causality for a GCFF based on two potential mechanisms.**


97 The diagram illustrates how an abrupt climate change event could lead to a multiple breadbasket
98 failure, which could cause a breakdown of global food trade or the continuation of trade with
99 adaptations. A breakdown in trade could result in widespread food shortages and price spikes,
100 which might trigger hoarding and panic buying behaviors that further exacerbate the crisis as
101 feedback loops. Ultimately, this could lead to a breakdown of the food system structures and
102 GCFF.


103

### 104 Potential GCFF scenarios

105 While it is heartening to note that large-scale famines have been decreasing over time due to
106 advances in agricultural science, international aid, and improved global food distribution [[1]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?qUwfmk), it is
107 essential to recognize that the specter of famine has not been banished from reality. The
108 following scenarios provide examples of triggers that could generate such food system failures
109 leading to famine:

##### 110 Abrupt Sunlight Reduction Scenarios (ASRSs)

111 Abrupt Sunlight Reduction Scenarios represent a subset of the most extreme food catastrophes,
112 where a sudden catastrophic event leads to a massive release of aerosol materials, such as
113 sulfates or black carbon (soot), into the stratosphere. This, in turn, causes an abrupt reduction


4


This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5116973


114 in absorbed solar radiation reaching Earth’s surface, global temperatures, and precipitation
115 levels, which could swiftly trigger near-total global agricultural collapse and push billions of
116 people into starvation if proper planning and preparedness are lacking [[9]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?zY4kyC) .


117 Three potential mechanisms for ASRSs have been identified in the literature:


118 Volcanic Winter: A large volcanic eruption can inject a substantial amount of aerosols into the
119 stratosphere, leading to a volcanic winter scenario. While the triggering of such winter
120 scenarios is rare, volcanic eruptions of this magnitude occur every 400-600 years [[10]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?jfL7tn), and have
121 had devastating consequences for global agriculture [[11]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?XsM3jA) .


122 Asteroid or Comet Impact Winter: An exceptionally large asteroid or comet impact can also
123 propel significant amounts of aerosols into the stratosphere, causing a sudden reduction in
124 sunlight. Although the likelihood of such impacts is exceedingly low, their potential impact is
125 catastrophic [[12]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?bAX24N) .


126 Nuclear Winter: A nuclear winter could be triggered by a large-scale nuclear war, particularly
127 one in which numerous cities are targeted. The subsequent firestorms could inject substantial
128 soot into the stratosphere, prolonging the nuclear winter for years [[13]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?L8UVBz) .


129


130 _Historical Case-study: Tambora Eruption of 1815_


131 _In April 1815, Mount Tambora in Indonesia erupted in one of the most significant volcanic events_
132 _in recorded history. The eruption was so massive that it injected an enormous amount of ash and_
133 _sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere (estimated to be 50-70 megatons of sulfur dioxide)_ _[[14]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?cw8HWu)_ _. The_
134 _subsequent cooling of the Earth's climate resulted in widespread crop failures, food shortages,_
135 _and famines in many parts of the world_ _[[11]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?9c6xmK)_ _. The year 1816 became known as the "Year Without a_
136 _Summer," as the Northern Hemisphere experienced unusually cold and harsh weather conditions_
137 _during the summer months. The consequences of the Tambora eruption underscore the potential_
138 _impact of extreme volcanic events on global food security._


139


140 A GCFF may also emerge as a consequence of more gradual systemic crises. These include, but
141 are not limited to: extreme weather-induced crop failures and yield reductions, loss of
142 pollinators, collapse of critical infrastructures supporting food production and distribution, and
143 breakdown of international trade and cooperation. Thus GCFF mitigation could particularly
144 benefit from methodologies and insights at the intersection of global catastrophic risk studies
145 and systemic risk studies

##### 146 Trade Disruption Scenarios

147 Trade disturbances would directly affect populations dependent on food imports, which have
148 grown substantially in recent decades [[2]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?cwgGmG) . Domestic food production reliant on imported
149 agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, feeds, and machinery would also be severely
150 impacted [[5]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?YDkqrR) . Under a scenario of a 50% shock to the supply of key inputs like fertilizers, pesticides
151 and machinery, global maize and wheat production could decrease by up to 26% and 21%
152 respectively, with high-yielding food production areas hit the hardest [[15]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?hOAVaj) .


5


This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5116973


153 Several potential mechanisms could trigger such devastating trade disturbances, including
154 pandemics and the containment measures imposed by governments, wars and conflicts that
155 disrupt supply chains and trade routes, and blockages of critical trade chokepoints like the Suez
156 Canal incident in 2021. While certain disruption events alone may not cause a GCFF,
157 compounding risk and cascades may lead to it, given the deeply interconnected nature of the
158 global food system.


159 As a result of the framing provided herein, the following scenario examples would not be
160 considered GCFFs:


161 **Slowly falling yields per hectare due to changing temperature and other climatic patterns.**
162 Anthropogenic climate change is a major risk to humanity and ecosystems. However, given its
163 gradual nature, it does not seem likely to cause a loss of yield that fits the needed-definition of
164 severity and abruptness of a GCFF. One possible mechanism for climate change to result in a
165 GCFF is through extreme weather events and regional climate changes linked by teleconnections
166 that trigger Multiple Breadbasket Failures in the >10% range of yield losses [[40]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?lxGHr1) . Climate change
167 has likely already caused a ~1% reduction in global production of ten crops at 1 degree celsius
168 of warming [[41]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?v9zFNL) .


169 Even accounting for this however, this average production figure would need to account for
170 regional and adaptations over the coming decades, such as cultivar shifts and enhancements,
171 which may mitigate impacts by a few percentage points [[42]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?nH90E6) . Overall, given the uncertainty of this
172 relationship, the significant time for adaptation, and also the fact that past yield shocks (see
173 Figure 1) were mitigated through production and market-responsivity/balancing, we are not
174 confident enough to classify chronic climate change as a GCFF trigger at this time. Nonetheless,
175 climate change is a threat multiplier that further underscores the importance of taking a
176 systemic perspective to GCFFs.


177 **A volcanic “autumn” that temporarily and abruptly changes the climate but only causes a**
178 **small variation in production that does not result in increased food insecurity.** Total production
179 shortfalls would need to be extreme enough to severely affect availability and/or affordability
180 of food for societies around the world. The world has seen many volcanic eruptions that have
181 even caused abruptly but mild cooler temperatures and drought effects (e.g. the Pinatubo
182 eruption [[43]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?O5OKnx) ), but rarely generate global consequences.


183 **The Irish Potato Famine (1845–1852)** was a significant food crisis in Ireland caused by a potato
184 blight that devastated the potato crop, which was a staple food for many Irish people at the
185 time. The blight resulted in widespread potato crop failures and led to a severe shortage of food.
186 The situation was also exacerbated by British policy toward Ireland at time time, which is
187 relevant for considering the role of policy in contributing to food failure. The famine had
188 devastating consequences on the Irish population, with millions of people suffering from
189 malnutrition and disease, and hundreds of thousands emigrating to escape the dire conditions.
190 This coincided with wider potato blight in Europe, known historically as the “Hungry Forties” [[1]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Sn86Sp) .
191 This famine illustrates how dependence on a single crop and vulnerability to plant diseases can
192 lead to catastrophic food failure on a regional and even continental scale. However, it did not
193 affect the global supply of food significantly, so cannot be considered a GCFF based on level of
194 severity.


195

##### 196 Estimates of GCFF Likelihood

197 Estimates regarding the likelihood of food shocks that significantly reduce global food
198 production vary. One climate modeling study indicates an approximately 80% probability of a


6


This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5116973


199 food shock resulting in a 10% reduction in global food production within this century,
200 emphasizing the persistent risk [[44]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?lMulJz) . A visualization of past food shocks (Figure 1) shows that a 5 %
201 global loss at some point seems likely, especially given that the reliable data for global yields
202 only exists from 1961 onwards. These food shocks since 1961 do not represent any major
203 climatic disruptive events like large magnitude eruptions, but recent research suggests that an
204 eruption with global climatic consequences is likely to occur in the next few hundred years, with
205 historical records indicating a frequency of 1 in 6 per century [[45]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?WktRsa) .
206
207 These forecasts underscore the importance of recognizing and preparing for the potential
208 occurrence of these catastrophic events, which could lead to GCFF on an unprecedented scale.

209


210 **Figure 1:** Occurrence frequency of global decreases in the supply of calories from 11 major crops
211 over the period 1961-2021.


212

213 [The line traces the frequency of shocks greater than the value given by the horizontal axis. For example,
214 a decrease of caloric production greater than 2.5% is recorded for ~10% of years. The caloric supply for
215 each year is estimated from FAO yield data [[46]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?OVBGO9) for barley, cassava, cotton, maize, millet, palm fruit,
216 potatoes, rapeseed, rice, sorghum, soybeans, sugar beet, sugar cane, and wheat. For each crop, yearly
217 fluctuations were calculated by subtracting a baseline trend from the actual yield time series. This baseline
218 trend was calculated by applying a first-order Savitzky-Golay filter (window length of 15 years) to the
219 original data. For each crop, decreases were then identified as years where the yield time series drops
220 below the smoothed baseline. The data for all crops were then aggregated by summing for each year
221 between 1961 and 2021 the increases and decreases for the 11 crops, weighting the contribution of each
222 crop by its relative contribution to the global supply of calories. [[47]](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?hNlpCp) ]


223

##### 224 The need for awareness and foresight

225 There may be a risk of action-paralysis occurring when dealing with such high impact, high
226 uncertainty events. We believe the opposite should be true. High uncertainty in this context
227 means that gaining additional information provides a significant boost in our understanding. This
228 is our motivation for raising awareness of GCFF.


229 It is essential to note that the likelihood of a GCFF is influenced by numerous interconnected
230 factors, and these arguments represent different perspectives within a complex and evolving
231 field of research. Pursuing a diverse, collaborative research agenda across these areas is


7


This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5116973


232 essential to fill knowledge gaps, deepen understanding and guide policy to transform food
233 systems. However, realizing this potential will depend on significant expansions in research and
234 scientific cooperation locally and globally. Resilience to GCFF requires bold ideas and
235 unprecedented collaboration across borders, sectors, and disciplines. By raising awareness of
236 GCFF, we hope to start a critical conversation that helps galvanize action towards food systems
237 that are robust, equitable, and capable of sustaining humanity in all potential risk scenarios.
