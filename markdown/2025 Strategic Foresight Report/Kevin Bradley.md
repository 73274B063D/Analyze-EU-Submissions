feedback: Thank you for the opportunity to input to this important annual exercise.
  The most important priorities for the EU given the current global realities, are
  defence (including cyber security) and energy security followed by climate adaptation
  (including water management and resilience) and biodiversity for food security.
  Major policy initiatives are required around defence and enhanced energy security
  and system resilience. Competitiveness of EU industries, in particular EEIs, requires
  further initiatives including more effective mechanisms to reduce energy costs and
  secure raw materials. Robust trade measures will also be needed to address dumping
  and predatory pricing. Regarding inter-generational fairness and social cohesion
  generally, the biggest problem facing most EU member states is affordable housing.
  An EU coordinated initiative to help member states address this core issue will
  be needed. Major tensions will exist around climate goals and energy supply and
  security. EU Foresight exercises can be enhanced through the creation of an EU Foresight
  Observatory with a broader range of experts inputs other than relying on the JRC.
  The forthcoming 2025 Foresight report should include a plausible policy context
  for 2040. My perspective on the 2040 scenario is attached.

llm_agreements: Both submissions recognise a more fragmented, geopolitically volatile
  2040 and the need to strengthen EU strategic autonomy through supply-chain diversification,
  trade and defence tools, and enhanced cyber/data security. They also agree climate
  change is a central resilience challenge requiring large-scale adaptation, energy
  system transformation and investments (including carbon removal/advanced energy
  options) as well as renewed focus on food, health and critical-industrial resilience.
llm_disagreements: 'They differ on priorities and approaches: one submission foregrounds
  democratic safeguards, regulatory enforcement, mission-driven public research (e.g.,
  pan‑European AI infrastructure), SRM research governance, mental‑health impacts
  of digital tech, and biosecurity measures such as biofoundries; the other emphasises
  industrial-scale responses — greater domestic resource extraction, circularity,
  trade defence, stronger military/defence posture, and pragmatic acceptance of conservative
  regulation slowing some bio-innovations. These differences reflect contrasting emphasis
  on precautionary governance and societal/ethical issues versus more realpolitik,
  resource- and industry-led resilience measures.'

**EU Foresight Report 2025 – Imagine 2040**


**EU Policy Context in 2040**


By 2040, humanity has formed into several separate and largely parallel, geo-economic clusters, each
operating within its own political values and social structure. Each system has evolved data
infrastructure and a digital ecosystem specific to their needs.


The duality of the rivalry between China and the United States has resulted in a complete realignment of
the global trading system. EU foreign and trade policy has adjusted and realigned to secure the EU´s
economic and physical security. The EU has substantially strengthened its trade defence and sanctions
toolbox to protect and make more resilient EU strategic industries and their value chains. Its own
economic resource base is more resilient through diversification of resource supply, increasing
indigenous resource exploitation (minerals and metals as well as bio-based resources) and deeper
circularity of materials in stock and in products.


In response to the geopolitical situation generally and to continued Russian interference along its
eastern frontier, the EU has strengthened its physical and cyber security systems as well as governance.
There is now a strong EU defence policy along with supporting measures including close cooperation
with NATO.


Increased digitisation of economies and the deployment of AI to manage complexity at all levels and
sectors of the EU economy sees a greater focus on data protection and data privacy. The EU has put in
place a robust cyber security apparatus to address the constant threat from cyber warfare and protect
the vast amounts of personal and industrial data on which its economy relies.


China’s strength as a global “resource lord” has been mitigated to some extent thanks to EU policies to
diversify its resources and greatly increase its own domestic supplies through extraction and the
institution of circular production systems. However, China continues to compete aggressively across the
globe. Its financial influence in developing access to raw materials and essential minerals in countries
around the world has further strengthened this with many less developed countries drawn into its
economic orbit, reducing a large number of them to client states.


The United States has significantly reduced its exposure to dependence on China for all critical raw
materials needed for military purposes and has in place agreements with Greenland, Canada and a
number of other third countries to ensure supplies of critical raw materials for its key economic sectors.


Despite significant efforts and vast expenditure, global warming has passed the Paris Agreement 1.5degree objective and is close to breaching the absolute average warming temperature of 2 degrees
centigrade. Each global system and economic cluster are now targeting adaptation measures in an effort
to protect its populations and economic systems. Fossil fuels continue to account for significant share of
final energy demand.


The EU energy transition, supporting its climate goals, has achieved greater integration of physical
networks and markets enabling greater flexibility and management of its large renewable and low fossilfuel energy sources and capacity. The EU has also deployed extensive carbon removal systems to
augment mitigation policies. Modular nuclear reactors (e.g. molten-salt) are increasingly deployed
aiding greater use of renewable energy.

Pressures on the biosphere in terms of biodiversity and water (quantity and quality) have accelerated
with further declines in non-human species in line with IPBES [1] predictions. Global collaborative efforts to
protect important biodiversity resources are locked in continued debates over financing. Due to climate
change, population growth and land use changes, water quality and quantity requires significant
financial resources to maintain human and agricultural systems.


Global population growth has stabilised but in Africa a range of cultural, political and environmental
factors contribute to continued population growth. Changing climatic conditions and continued regional
instability create continued migratory pressures in Africa, the Middle East and parts of central Asia with
much of the migration towards Europe.


Global food security therefore continues to be unstable with countries in Africa particularly vulnerable
to shortages related to droughts, resource wars and lack of access to modern farming practices and
technology. As a consequence of these trends, food security has reemerged strongly as a pillar of EU and
like-minded regions´ political goals. Efforts have been made to make agricultural and food production
systems more adaptive with regard to climate change impacts and more aligned with biodiversity and
water conservation.


The attempts to dramatically shift diets to more sustainable ones including scaling up of food innovation
(cellular agriculture) have largely failed due to stringent and conservative regulatory environments and
cultural adverse attitudes to “synthetic foods.” However, animal welfare has been increased thanks to
innovation and digitalization in animal husbandry. A larger portion of plant based protein in food
products has become a standard part of the European diet, especially among younger populations.


The health and wellbeing of humanity is impacted in a multi-track world. While major pandemics such as
COVID-19 do not occur, regional or localised epidemics occur frequently. Access to medicines, medical
skills and technology is not universal and requires a degree of global cooperation even between
competing regions. Obesity has become a more general health issue despite attempts to improve overall
diet quality of populations or deploy drugs to deal with chronic cases. The importance of maintaining
and protecting highly biodiverse ecosystems as a future source of pharmaceuticals becomes paramount
and is part of a global discussion on equitable access and use of such resources.


Global debt continues to weigh on all economies. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ramping up of
recovery programmes in its aftermath has added greatly to the global and EU debt burden. A number of
debt crises occur, mainly in the least developed countries. But broader global financial meltdown is
prevented thanks to collective intervention by major economies including debt relief for poorer
developing countries.
