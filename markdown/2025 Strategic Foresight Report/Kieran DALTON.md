feedback: Europe in 2040 begins today so what we do today shapes how the future looks
  and develops. Today Europe is reeling from the US elections and is reacting to sudden
  geopolitical shifts which has shaken the EU bloc. Foresight now implies that EU
  must quickly consolidate alliances intra EU in the first instance and then actually
  succeed in a neighbourhood policy that is result based on matters like technology,
  trade, climate and conflict resolution. The key sectors are shifting towards AI,
  renewable energy, health, space technology and social innovation so that our societies
  must now be prepared for these shifts through R&D and education. . Demographic shifts
  within Europe are happening at pace often driven by neighbourhood conflict and/or
  restricted development in these regions. Europe must develop ways to ideas to stabilise
  these regions including through extending our technology etc to creating prosperity
  elsewhere. Finally EU citizens in the EU mosaic have a wealth of ideas and experience
  that can feed into the future solutions so engaging and mobilising the societies
  will strengthen the alliance from the bottom up. The EU should not simply become
  a place of big corporations where people work but strong societies where people
  contribute to common good.
