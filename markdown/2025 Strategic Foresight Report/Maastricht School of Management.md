feedback: i am a member of the Jean Monnet Policy Dialogue group AfriqEurope, led
  by the University of the Peloponnese, which includes about 30 European and African
  institutions of Higher Education and thinktanks. One of the issues we discussed
  was the limited impact that EPA's are having on Africa's development. Moreover,
  it lacks a strategic and coherent approach. My paper pointed to the need for EPA's
  as framework agreements only and for a more comprehensive bilateral "Deep PTA" that
  would encompass aid, trade and investment linked to critical value chains in Africa.
  This approach would be more strategic, more coherent and more impactful. If you

# EU Preferential trade agreements and Africa in the Post-Cotonou era; where do we go from here?


Paper for the Jean Monnet policy debate “AfriquEurope; The European Union and Africa in a
Multicrisis world”, conference on “Trade and Economic Partnership agreements”.


Mr. Drs. Andre Dellevoet, Maastricht School of Management

# **I. Introduction**


In classical economics, exports have the potential to boost national output and serve as a growth
engine. Expansion of a country's foreign trade may revitalise an otherwise dormant economy and
lead it down the road to wealth and growth. Increased foreign demand may result in large-scale
production and lower unit costs as a result of economies of scale. Increased exports may lead to
better utilisation of existing capacity and hence lower costs, which could lead to even more export
growth. Expanding exports may result in more job possibilities. However, Least developed countries
(LDC’s) often have a narrow export base, consisting mostly of primary products, such as agricultural
commodities, minerals and oil and gas with little value added (Todaro and Smith 2015). This has
proven to be too limited to provide a basis for a country’s development. Moreover, due to high
competition and volatile prices relative to manufactured products in global markets, the monetary
value of exports of primary products is diminishing.


To shield LDC’s from competition and safeguard their participation in international trade, regional or
bilateral, preferential trade agreements (PTA’s) have been concluded between various industrialized
countries and LDC’s. The most comprehensive PTA’s have been between the US and LDC’s under
AGOA and the EU agreements with groups of developing countries, such as the ex-colonies in the
Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP countries) under the successive Yaoundé, Lomé and Cotonou
agreements and LDC’s under the Global Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), GSP+ and
Everything But Arms (EBA). This is highly welcomed by developing countries in the Global South.
They see trade as a powerful engine for economic growth, poverty reduction and development. Out
of 110 respondents to an WTO/OECD survey in 2024, the strategies of 94 per cent of partner
countries include trade priorities. The responses of developing economies – and in particular LDCs –
show that they are looking at trade to support economic growth (95 per cent of responses) and
economic diversification (79 per cent of responses) (WTO/OECD 2024).


In this paper, we would like to explore what these PTA’s have meant for Africa. In particular, the
extent in which these agreements have lived up to the implicit or explicit recognition that trade
preferences would play a critical role in the LDC’s development process.


We will first look at the economic and juridical basis for trade preferences, focusing on the EU. This
will be followed by an assessment of the importance of these trade preferences for the EU, but
especially for the LDC’s. Where data are available, specific attention will be given to Africa. Finally,
the paper will explore an alternative form of trade preferences that may point the way forward for
EU-Africa trade relations.

# **II. The theoretical and juridical basis for trade preferences**


1


The notion of providing trade preferences for development purposes has its origins in Prebisch and
Singer’s work on the secular decline in the terms of trade for agricultural commodities and the
perception that only manufacturing could provide stability and jobs in developing countries (Todaro
and Smith 2015). The Prebisch-Singer hypothesis led to two important policy prescriptions: sectoral
intervention favouring import-competing manufacturing industry (import-substitution
industrialization), and the idea of creating non-reciprocal tariff preferences to foster manufactured
exports from the developing countries. In the latter case, the Generalized System of Preferences
(GSP) is the most extensive and explicit expression of an attempt to use trade preferences as a tool of
development, but today there are also hundreds of other schemes, limited to sub-groups of
developing countries, with varying product coverage and preferential arrangements. Juridically,
preferences for LDCs form a sub-set of the GSP, while other unilateral preferences depend on explicit
waivers of the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules (Cernat et al. 2003).


PTA’s have long been regarded as a factor limiting the development of multilateral trade which has
been the raison d’être for the GATT agreements in the past and currently the WTO. Although PTAs
may promote development, they necessarily discriminate against non-members and can therefore
lead to trade diversion in a way that hurts both member countries and excluded countries. At the
same time, PTAs create larger and more competitive markets and benefit producers and consumers
through economies of scale and lower prices, among other effects. Beyond market access motives,
PTAs are increasingly used as engines of change in many developing countries, to promote,
implement, and lock in reforms in a wide range of policy areas such as investment regimes,
competition rules, and government procurement (Chauffour and Maur 2011).


For more than 50 years, The EU unilaterally and without reciprocation, grants a large number of
more favourable terms to LDCs and developing countries. Most of them are tariff preferences
accorded in the framework of GSP (112 countries) and the special incentive arrangements granted
under GSP to Andean and Central American countries (12 countries plus Pakistan) which are
conducting anti-drug campaigns, or the "Everything But Arms" initiative in favour of LDCs (49
countries). Table 1 below provides a simple overview of the EU’s general trade preferences.

As mentioned above, non-reciprocal tariff preferences are also granted to the ACP countries under
the Cotonou agreement (77 countries) and to associated overseas countries and territories. Since the
first decade of the millennium, the preferences under Cotonou are phased out and replaced by
Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA’s), with subregions rather than individual countries. In 2023,
a “Post Cotonou” agreement was signed with the ACP countries but this no longer contains explicit
trade preferences nor a multi-annual budget for the ACP countries.

_Table 2. EU-ACP trade preference schemes (Source: OACPS-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly)_







In both the GSP and Cotonou agreements, the EU unilaterally provides preferential access to the
common market through reduced or removed EU import tariffs, with the explicit aim to foster the
sustainable development of lower income countries and to reduce poverty through international
trade. However, GSP benefits are linked to beneficiary countries’ respect of international standards


3


on human rights, labour rights, environment and climate, and good governance (Cernat et al. 2003).
Moreover, they are increasingly linked to investment promotion and protection as well.


These agreements work well for the EU. At the end of 2023 the EU had 42 preferential trade
agreements in place with 74 partners, covering EUR 2.3 trillion or 45.8% of total EU external trade.
The agreements continue to open markets for EU business, including 680.000 exporting small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), helping them to connect to growth markets while relying on a
stable and more predictable set of rules. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the EU was able to preserve its share
of around 20% in the total imports of Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) partners over the past
10 years (i.e. since the EPAs entered into force). By contrast, the EU’s share in imports of non-EPA
countries has declined by 3% over the same period, leaving the EU in second place after China
(European Commission 2024).

# **III. The Development impact of trade preferences**


The agreements seem to work less well for the LDC’s. Despite the intentions by the EU to promote
development through trade under both the GSP and the Cotonou and EBA arrangements, there is
widespread criticism that the development effect of these preferential trade agreements have been
very limited. This is due to a number of fundamental constraints at both the supply side as well as
the demand side.


At the supply side


The utilization of trade preferences depends on the national conditions and specifically on the supply
capacity of the recipient country. The EBA agreement for example is targeted at the poorest
countries in the world. Hence, it is plausible to assume that they possess only a limited capacity to
produce and export more goods. Transport, infrastructure and potential to adjust the production
structure are some of the conditions for effective participation of the EBA regime. If these are not
available it cannot be expected that the beneficiary countries will experience an increase in their
exports. Preferential market access on its own is not sufficient to solve the supply-side constraints of
the LDCs. Unfortunately, under EBA it seems that trade is insufficiently targeted at lifting these
supply-side constraints (Gradeva and Martinez-Zarzozo 2010, Gnutzmann-Mkrtchyan 2022). Figure 1
below gives an overview of the supply side constraints that SME’s typically face to participate in
Global Value Chains (GVC’s).

Gradeva and Martinez-Zarzozo (2010) found that the EBA agreement seems to have exactly the
opposite effect as its goals: instead of increasing the size of exports, the arrangement actually
reduces it. This is because of the “trade diversion” i.e. non LDC ACP countries still face tariffs and
quotas and find themselves competing in the same industries, such as textiles, against eligible LDC’s
with the ultimate effect not of trade creation, but rather trade reduction (Page and Hewitt 2002).
Moreover, due to more relaxed Rules of Origin and administrative requirements, most LDC’s
preferred to use the Cotonou Agreement. Unver-utilisation of the EBA regime, especially in the
period of 2000-2010, can therefore largely be explained by the preference for a competing scheme
(OECD 2005).


Some of the supply side constraints are addressed by accompanying “aid for trade” policies. These
include a wide range of support mechanisms to facilitate trade; 1) technical assistance — helping
countries to develop trade strategies, negotiate more effectively, and implement outcomes, 2)
Infrastructure — building the roads, ports, digitalization and telecommunications that link domestic
and global markets, 3) Productive capacity — investing in industries and sectors so countries can
diversify exports and build on comparative advantages and 4) adjustment assistance — helping with
the costs associated with tariff reductions, preference erosion, or declining terms of trade.


Aid for Trade was already included in the Lome agreements and continued under the EBA and EPA’s.
It is also a prominent part of the WTO. However, despite significant resources (over US$600 billion
between 2006 and 2022), the WTO/OECD identified several challenges that could be addressed to
enhance the scale and effectiveness of Aid for Trade projects, including: a lack of harmony between
project durations and funding cycles; institutional capacity constraints; too narrow a set of financing
instruments to support objectives; and discrepancies in understanding recipients’ needs and
coordination among stakeholders (WTO/OECD 2024).


At the demand side


Over a period of about 50 years, the ACP and EU trade relations were dominated by the Lome and
Cotonou agreements, which were increasingly seen as means to advance economic development for
the ACP countries. Given the small size of the economies of most ACP countries, it may be assumed
that a significant development impact may be visible by now. To assess this performance, we looked
at UNDP’s human development indicators, and selected a random number of 6 countries in the ACP
[country list (htps://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specifc-country-data#/countries) . They vary from](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries)

Even though countries made progress on most of the HDI indicators, over more than 20 years,
progress was generally so limited that they remained in their own low or medium range of
development. Even where a country graduated from high to very high, such as Trinidad and Tobago,
or low to medium such as Papua New Guinea, the question whether that was attributable to the EU
trade preferences, remains. In the case of Papua New Guinea for example, the higher HDI score was
mainly due to the development of the extractive industries which is not covered by the PTA with the
EU. Hence, the trade preferences don’t seem to have had a significant development effect
(Wakarmamu and Indrayono 2019).


Looking back at almost three decades of EU-ACP trade relations, Udvari comes to the conclusion that
there was no impact of the Lomé Conventions on the economic development of the ACP countries
(Udvari 2009). This may be a bit too harsh. According to the European Commission, at least the GSP
regime provides substantial economic benefits to its beneficiaries, with the strongest impact on the


6


EBA beneficiary countries. Between 2014 and 2019, preferential imports from EBA beneficiaries
increased by 81% (from €13.9 billion to €25.2 billion in 2019). In the absence of GSP+ preferences,
the GDP of GSP+ beneficiaries could be reduced by up to 0.3% - in absolute terms, up to €6.6 billion and exports from GSP+ beneficiaries to the EU could drop by up to 25%. (European Commission
2023). The question remains however, if the benefits are significant for the development process of
the LDC’s?


To answer that question, Touicrar looked at the impact of EBA on LDC trade growth and concluded
that, due to exogenous and endogenous factors, the economic benefits for LDC’s that moved from
ACP-EU preferential trade regimes to EBA were very modest. Spill-over from pre-existing ACP-EU
market access agreements meant that EBA offers only a modest increase in quota and tariff free
access to the EU market for most LDC’s. The EU’s Rules of Origin and the EBA’s Safeguard clauses
(suspension or withdrawal of trade preferences in case of massive imports that cause disturbance in
the EU’s common market, a provision that was already included in the Lome agreement) ensure that
any gains for LDC exporters do not come at the expense of EU producers or adversely affect EU trade
or financial interests (This was already a criticism under Lome, see Blackwell 1985 and for EBA
Touicrar 2012). The Rules of Origin also create significant burdens for the poorest nations, even
though they have been somewhat relaxed recently (AGRINFO 2024). Furthermore, despite being
reformed to reduce protection and support for EU producers, the continued Common Agricultural
Policy still provides a significant advantage to EU agricultural producers over LDC producers, both by
undercutting them at their home market through export subsidies as well as in the EU market due to
domestic producer support, rising costs of administration, compliance and transport as well as NTB’s
(Cernat 2003, Touicrar 2012, OECD 2005). In a quantitative study, Liapis estimated that the
preferential access to the agricultural markets of the US, EU and Japan, amounted to an additional
US$ 1,4 billion a year, not impressive compared to almost US$ 90 billion of dutiable agricultural
produce each year (Liapis 2007).


Research from Lund University further confirmed that GSP+ had little or no effect on trade flows in
general and differing effects depending on product group. The biggest positive impact was registered
in live animals and animal products, beverages and tobacco, crude inedible materials except fuels,
mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials (Kahn 2014). However, these benefits may be further
reduced if additional conditionality is imposed, for example through export restrictions (as can be
seen currently against Russia but also extended to former soviet republics in central Asia) and tarrif
wars, which are both rising in importance (Bown 2023). Hence it is likely that beneficiary countries
will make less and less use of GSP+ trade preferences since the costs of compliance may increasingly
outweigh the benefits from increased exports. GSP+ doesn’t seem to have much future as a trade
enhancing tool nor to promote core values of the EU through positive conditionality. Another study
by Cernat et al. also found that the EBA initiative would only produce moderate welfare and trade
gains and was heavily skewed towards a small number of large countries such as India (also see Laipis
2007 for agricultural markets). The effects on the EU itself are minimal, as the increased market
access for LDCs comes mostly at the expense of other preference-receiving countries (the ACP
countries under the Lome agreements), although the changes are modest (Cernat et al 2003).


When one looks at the list of eligible products under the preferential trade list (GSP, GSP+ and EBA),
then it seems that, though the total number of products is large, the product categories don’t seem
to be in line with countries comparative advantage or main ”sources of growth”, which was already a
criticism under the Lome treaties for ACP countries (Blackwell 1985). The Union argues that EBA
reflects Europe’s desire to see all WTO members benefit from trade liberalisation. In reality, however,
market access improvements brought about as a direct result of EBA, above the preferences ACP


7


countries already enjoyed under the Lome agreements, are limited to a restricted range of
temperate agricultural products such as: beef, cheese, maize, bananas, rice and sugar. In terms of
export potential and employment generation, sugar is one of the most important products to be
affected by EBA, but this was excluded, along with bananas and rice, until 2009, after which it was
granted limited market access through import quotas against zero or reduced tariffs. In 2009, this
represented just 1,2% of the EU’s sugar production (Gibb 2006). The lack of impact was also noted
by Gradeva et al, who doubted that EBA utilization rates will increase significantly. The export share
of the 919 products liberalized with the introduction of the EBA agreement (on top of the products
already admitted under the Lome and Cotonou agreements) remained very low; 0.03% of total LDCs’
exports to the EU in 2001. Even the three products with delayed liberalization - bananas, rice and
sugar - had an export share of 0.47% of total LDCs’ exports to the EU in 2001 (Gradeva and MartinezZarzoso 2010). According to the European Commission, between 2014 and 2019, imports under the
EBA arrangement increased by 47%, rising from €17.1 billion in 2014 to €25.2 billion in 2019. Still, in
2019, imports from LDCs accounted for only 2% of the EU’s total imports, with 67% of these imports
benefiting from EBA preferences [1] .


The potential effectiveness of PTA’s is further eroded by incoherence between policies. The first is
between aid, aimed at poverty reduction and trade, aimed at economic growth. There exists a
natural tension between these two sectors and whether trade policy is or should be a form of aid. A
related but different concern is over the distribution of aid between LDC’s and Middle-income
economies, where trade volumes and interests are larger. A third incoherence found concerns
discrimination between developing countries that are part of the PTA’s and those that are not. The
fourth derives from the relationship between trade and agricultural policy. Finally, the fact that some
policies affecting developing countries are formulated and/or administered at Union level and others
by national governments adds an incoherence. A good example of such incoherence is the EU’s
agricultural subsidies, which result in export dumping and cause farmers in developing countries to
suffer low prices, lost market shares, and unfair competition. What this means is best illustrated by
the case of sugar. EU sugar costs three times as much to produce as in India and five times more
Zambia but, paradoxically, the EU is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of sugar. The explanation lies in
EU sugar subsidies; €2.7 billion in 2003. It is estimated that EU subsidies and market restrictions on
sugar cost Mozambique $38 million in 2004 and Malawi $32 million. The EU subsidy policy not only
denies the developing world crucial revenue and destabilises key industries, it also costs the average
European in terms of higher taxes and prices (Brown 2005).


Another impediment is that tariff or quota’s are only part of the challenge that LDC exporters face.
Tariff escalation is a major disincentive to add value. EU tariff escalation does occur in agricultural
imports for a number of the ten selected product categories. Using a detailed tariff dataset
Wageningen University researchers concluded that the EU applies tariff escalation on its imports of
cocoa, tomatoes, palm oil, soy, leather and cotton. Import tariffs (as percentage, as an amount per
tonne or a combination of the two) applied on these product categories are higher for processed
than for unprocessed products (Van Berkum 2009).


The widespread application of NTB’s is another impediment. For example, in the Solomon islands in
the Pacific, an important economic sector is fisheries which accounts for more than 15% of its
[exports (htps://www.solomonbusinessregistry.gov.sb/why-invest-in-solomon-islands/key-sectors/) .](https://www.solomonbusinessregistry.gov.sb/why-invest-in-solomon-islands/key-sectors/)
However, under EBA, the EU employs a tariff escalation policy on tuna products imported into the

common market. Moreover, the EU has highly restrictive rules of origin and also complies with strict
sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards (SPS) and a regulation on illegal, unregulated and unreported
(IUU) fishing. For example, when exporting fish under EBA, a vessel must be registered and sail under
the flag of the beneficiary country or the EU. The transportation costs are increased further because
goods that benefit from EBA must be transported directly to the EU; transit to any other country
must be documented and the goods verified to have been under the supervision of the customs
authority of the transit country. Clearly, these types of regulations increase transaction costs and
reduce the margin of preference and net benefits of the program. On top of that, The Solomon
islands suffer from tariff preference erosion as the EU signs more PTA’s with other countries in the
[region such as Papua New Guinea (htps://www.thecommonwealth-](https://www.thecommonwealth-ilibrary.org/index.php/comsec/catalog/download/15/12/94?inline=1)
[ilibrary.org/index.php/comsec/catalog/download/15/12/94?inline=1](https://www.thecommonwealth-ilibrary.org/index.php/comsec/catalog/download/15/12/94?inline=1) ).


When the trade-restrictiveness of non-tariff measures is incorporated in the form of a tariff
equivalent, the average import barrier for a product group goes up to 27 per cent. For example, to
export an agricultural product to a developed country, a small farmer from an LDC would have to
compete against a subsidized farmer from the EU and obtain the required certifications from
accredited laboratories, fully understand the complex tariff structures and how to use tariff rate
quotas if any, find efficient and affordable transportation, navigate the border checking and
inspection of the destination country, adhere to the private standards of the buyer in the destination
country and so on. In the short term, however, non-tariff measures can directly reduce the
competitiveness of exports from developing countries, as complying with technical or safety
regulations overseas increases the fixed and sometimes variable costs of production (UNCTAD 2014).


The proliferation of bilateral or regional free trade agreements, declining the WTO’s most–favoured
nation tariffs, the emergence of non-tariff measures, tariff escalation and the prominence of global
value chains driven by multinational corporations, all have eroded the effectiveness of traditional
trade preference schemes. For this reason, the effect of trade preferences today falls on a few
specific markets, products and exporters. As noted above, Asian LDCs were the main beneficiaries
under the EBA regime. For instance, Bangladesh managed to gradually increase its utilization of EBA
preferences, especially in the garments sector, from about 60% in 2002 to almost 80% in 2008, and
its imports under EBA have more than doubled. In the same vein, the top three GSP+ beneficiaries in
terms of export value to the EU (Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka) accounted for over 90% of
all imports into the EU under GSP+ . In terms of products, textiles and clothing combined represent
nearly 60% of all GSP+ imports into the EU in 2022, followed by electrical machinery and oils, fats
and waxes (Eurostat 2023). Sub-Saharan Africa benefitted much less. Trade preferences have helped
create jobs in the sectors benefiting the most, such as textiles but as these sectors involve mostly raw
materials and light manufacturing, tariff preferences alone are not sufficient to drive export
diversification.


Positve conditonality


Under the EU’s three-tiered GSP system as highlighted in table 1, two types of sanctions exist
according to Regulation (EU) No. 978/2012 (2012). First, Article 15 provides that the GSP+ tariffs can
be withdrawn when a country does not ratify or implement the relevant conventions (for example on
adherence to human rights standards) or when it fails to cooperate on reporting and monitoring
processes. Sanctioned countries temporarily, for all or certain products, fall back on standard GSP. It
was applied to Sri Lanka (2010–2017) and Venezuela (2009–2014).


Second, Article 19 foresees temporary withdrawal of preferential tariffs for all or certain products
when the principles laid down in the conventions are “seriously and systematically violated” or when


9


goods involve prison labor. Importantly, this applies to the countries that fall under the standard GSP,
GSP+, and EBA schemes. This type of sanctions was applied to Burma/Myanmar(1997–2013), Belarus
(2006–present), and Cambodia(2020–present).


Similarly, the EU treats article 96 of the Cotonou agreement as an important and potentially positive
instrument to enforce the "essential elements" (namely, respect for human rights, the rule of law
and democracy).


In general, it seems that attaching conditions on improvement of good governance and human rights
to preferential trade agreements, hasn’t produced much effect either. When we look at the World
[Bank world governance indicators (htps://www.worldbank.org/en/publicaton/worldwide-](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access)
[governance-indicators/interactve-data-access) for the same group of countries, we see mostly either](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access)
stagnation or decline (sometimes after a period of improvement).

Of course, progress or decline depends on so many factors outside of the EU’s control as well as the
proportion of the economy that depends on trade with the EU, that one needs to be careful with
these data. Nevertheless, governance standards were more explicitly included in Lome IV (since
1990) and the subsequent Cotonou agreements (since 2000), so the conclusion is warranted that
there is no visible impact of EU PTA’s on the improvement of governance in the countries concerned
(Also see Bahntia 2007). Even in countries where the trade preferences have produced significant
growth in a certain sector such as garments, the impact of withdrawal of trade preferences because


10


of a deterioration of governance and human rights seems limited. For example, duty-free Cambodian
textile and footwear exports to the EU were up to 11 % and 17 %, respectively, cheaper than they
would be under standard tariffs. This competitive advantage fuelled an export boom: Cambodia's
exports to the EU (mostly shoes and clothing), grew by 630 % since 2008, and made up 39 % of the
country's total exports by 2014. This in turn has helped to keep the economy growing at a steady 7 %
a year, and to lift one-third of the country's population out of poverty between 2007 and 2014.
Suspending the EBA could put some of these achievements at risk by making the country's exports
less competitive. Around 2 million Cambodians depend on the textile industry, including 750 000
employees [2] . However, the threats and decisions to suspend trade preferences for Cambodia (since
2020), has not led to any improvement in the Human Rights score countries over time, as can be
seen from figure 1 below. This is also true for Myanmar which has been at odds with the EU since the
1990’s.


_Figure 1. Human Rights Index for Myanmar and Cambodia (Source_ :
[htps://ourworldindata.org/human-rights )](https://ourworldindata.org/human-rights)


This limited effect is partly due to ambiguity on the EU’s side. Investigating the case of withdrawal of
EBA trade preferences in Myanmar, Angela Pennisi di Floristella highlighted that, contrary to EU
claims of a more assertive trade policy, EU trade decisions have been primarily influenced by
normative dilemmas connected to the unwanted consequences for the local economy of punishing
trade instruments. This may lead to a preference for more targeted withdrawal of benefits to a
specific group of actors. This type of “principled pragmatism” has also been the basis for the EU
approach to human rights violations in Cambodia and Vietnam (Pennisi di Floristella 2021). The
ambiguity may even be more pronounced as the withdrawal of trade preferences actually might hurt
certain EU importers more. Tanaka found that tariff increases have had a significantly negative
impact on EU import of affected goods. These effects are heterogeneous across knitted garments,
woven garments, and footwear products (Tanaka 2021).


Economic Partnerships


Will Economic Partnership Agreements be more effective? It may be too early to draw any
conclusions. Most EPA’s take 15 to 20 years to be negotiated, agreed and ratified and have only


2 [htps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2019/637931/EPRS_ATA(2019)637931_EN.pdf](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2019/637931/EPRS_ATA(2019)637931_EN.pdf)


11


recently come into force. However, there are some aspects that may lead to the conclusion that
expectations may be too high.


The first is that the alleged promotion of regional integration, is counter to the actual trade flows. As
can be seen from graph 1 below, within sub-Saharan Africa, intra-regional trade is limited with only
15% of exports and 10% of imports circulating within the region. It is important to note that this
doesn’t include the substantial, informal cross-border trade. Nevertheless, it is clear that old colonial
patterns of exports in commodities and trade preferences have continued to dominate south-north
trade flows, rather than south-south.


_Graph 1. Intra regional trade in Africa and other trade blocs (Source; statista)_


This is logical. There are several contributing factors: the ACP market for primary products (its main
export) is small, transportation links are weak, import tariffs are high, and continued political
instability and institutional weakness have made attempts at regional integration difficult. Indeed,
given that Yaoundé and Lomé offered preferential free access to the EU, it is hardly surprising that
intra-ACP trade remained low as ACP trade dependence on the EU grew (Bahntia 2007).


The second factor to doubt EPA’s effectiveness is that the EU defined the regional groups. These six
groups – West Africa, Central-Africa, East Africa, the Southern African Development Community,
Caribbean Community and Pacific Region – do not, in most cases, correspond to intra-regional trade
relations nor existing regional organizations. Not only does this weaken the ACP’s role as an equal
overall participant in determining its policies, but it also means that most regional groups will have to
start dialogue and cooperation from scratch, and this could create friction and complexity due to
overlapping existing arrangements. The groups may be highly unwieldy, and focus may be more on
keeping all countries on board through dialogue and dispute settlement, than on actual trade growth


12


actions [3] . They may also splinter due to an inability to reach consensus on trade provisions of the EPA,
such as which products or industries to liberalize first.


Thirdly, there is significant cause for concern relating to the negative consequences of EPAs for jobs
in the continent, particularly in labour intensive, import-competing agricultural sectors. EPA’s are
much more reciprocal than their predecessors under the Lome and Cotonou agreements, in the
sense that LDC’s also have to open up their markets for EU exporters. As we saw above, this may
actually create unfair competition for local producers in domestic markets. These kind of free trade
deals may actually stimulate migration from Africa to Europe. This apparent paradox is underscored
by recent fieldwork conducted in Ghana’s poultry sector which highlights business stakeholders’
deep concerns about EPAs stoking unemployment and migration (Price and Langan 2021).


Fourthly, the principle of equal partnerships between the EU and the ACP countries has increasingly
become asymmetrical and political rather than developmental. The Post-Cotonou agreement, which
no longer contains multi-year financial commitments, and the end of the European Development
Fund (EDF) represent a major break with the past four Lome agreements and Cotonou Partnership
Agreement of 2000. Aid funds now fall under the EU budget as a whole, but are the sole preserve of
the European Commission. All that remains is a commitment to dialogue through joint institutions
such as the Committee of Ambassadors. The ACP states have organized themselves in the
Organization of ACP states (OACPS) with a new agreement that makes no explicit reference to the EU
anymore (Mackie 2021). It seems that the special relationship between the EU and the ACP countries
has become more symbolic (Arts 2004).

# **IV. An alternative form of Trade Preferences**


In view of the fundamental changes in the relationship between the EU and the LDC’s over a period
of more than half a century, of which the latest is the geopolitical rivalry between the US and China
and the expansion of the latter into Africa, as well as the disappointing performance of trade
preferences in terms of development and promotion of democracy and human rights, it is justified to
explore new ways of using trade preferences for development.


Some elements of this new way could be:


**1)** **Deeper trade preferences**


In line with international developments and the demise of the multilateral system under the
WTO, the EU should move on and ensure market access on a bilateral basis through “deep PTA’s”
where obligations deepen, become more complex, and provide more value. This would be at the
detriment of a truly global preferential trade regime, such as the WTO, and entails highly
asymmetrical power relations with most LDC’s. However, it also means that it can leverage its
dominant position in trade negotiations with often undemocratic, weak and highly corrupt
counterparts to search for win-win solutions, where both the European interest and the interests
of the local population are respected and guaranteed;


**2)** **More comprehensive Aid for Trade**


EU Aid for Trade is directed towards GSP beneficiary countries is largely on two areas. First, trade
policy and regulations, which often includes support to the capacity of designing and
implementing trade policy, including specific areas such as frameworks on sanitary and


[3 For an actual state of affairs, see htps://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/development-and-sustainability/economic-](https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/development-and-sustainability/economic-partnerships_en)
[partnerships_en](https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/development-and-sustainability/economic-partnerships_en)


13


phytosanitary (SPS) measures, intellectual property rights, technical regulations, trade facilitation
and customs reforms. Secondly, building trade development related capacity, which often
includes a focus on strengthening the utilisation of the GSP and other arrangements through
supporting export competitiveness of businesses, creating links with buyers, etc. (European
Commission 2023). The Commission could expand this area to encompass a much wider range of
targeted aid interventions including trade related infrastructure investments, vocational
education and access to finance. Aid would not be replaced by trade and investment, but rather
be complementary and supportive of them, thereby enhancing coherence (Gradeva et al 2010);


**3)** **High value goods**


The EU and developing country signatory, should provide liberal trade preferences on goods that
are not marginal but of significant importance to both European importers as well as LDC
exporters within certain value chains with large growth potential. That growth potential should
be directed through joint policies and investments towards inclusion and upgrading of local
businesses rather than creating monopolies or oligopolies;


**4)** **Trade and Investment**


This choice would also make it more likely that European and local firms will be interested in
further investments. As trade and investment become more and more intertwined in the context
of international supply chains and firms’ strategies of vertical specialization, countries are
increasingly incorporating investment provisions into PTAs instead of negotiating bilateral
investment treaties (Chauffour et al 2011). Hence, the new approach should draw trade
preferences closer to investments in the value chain, especially in upstream activities, where the
development impact will be highest. On the beneficiary countries’ side, incentives for foreign
investment could take the form of fiscal benefits for priority sectors, establishment of special
economic zones, one-stop shops for foreign investors, and insurance for investors;


**5)** **Trade in services**


The deep PTA could include a comprehensive chapter on trade in services, which has often been
controversial in a multilateral setting. Several PTAs between developed and developing countries
have included new categories of labor, such as technicians, nurses, and health care workers, in
their trade agreements or have offered an expanded number of categories for service suppliers,
combined with expanded quotas. Other PTAs have eliminated the quotas altogether for certain
categories of services suppliers (usually, professionals). This could be further expanded by
allowing easier market access to specialised, European service providers, which would greatly
enhance the quality of services such as technical assistance and financial services, available to
value chain partners;


**6)** **Access to technology**


The deep PTA could also make progress on the issue of access to technology: Article 66.2 of the
Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) under the World
Trade Organization provides a basis for “preferential” transfer of technology in favour of LDCs.
However, the implementation of the provisions has not been satisfactory. Trade preferences
could be explored as a vehicle to promote technology transfer. For example, preferential tariffs
and rules of origin may be designed in such a way as to incentivize the use of advanced
technologies, such as green technologies. Preference schemes may also encompass measures to
strengthen technology absorptive capacity in beneficiary countries (UN 2024);


14


**7)** **Procurement**


PTAs that include government procurement provisions promote a liberal agenda, acknowledging
the benefits of transparent non-discriminatory and competitive procurement. The provisions
typically cover a dozen aspects of procurement policies, including non-discrimination principles,
procedural rules, dispute settlement mechanisms, commitments to cooperation and further
negotiations, state entities and sectors covered, and special exceptions know as offsets.
Flexibilities are available to negotiators, including exclusion of certain entities from the
agreement, the threshold set in order for procurement, to be covered by the agreement, the
exclusion of sectors such as defense and financial services, and the use of offsets or set-asides to
accommodate domestic policies such as the promotion of indigenous communities or small
businesses (Bruhn 2014);


**8)** **Flexible “living”agreement**


The PTA should be drafted as a “living agreement” with a commitment to a work plan or
prioritization of problem resolution through harmonization, mutual recognition, equivalence
measures, and other policy tools that enable elimination or mitigation of trade related problems
over time. PTA provisions on TBTs and SPS measures should be legally binding, through a
judicious combination of “soft” and “hard” law. The provisions should provide a pathway that
permits integration to evolve and deepen over time by allowing the gradual resolution of TBT
and SPS issues in the bilateral relationship. Such a pathway should be considered an integral part
of any PTA that aims to deal effectively with standards, certification, and conformity assessment
problems (Chauffour et al 2011);


**9)** **Economic Governance and dispute settlement**


Economic governance of the PTA should receive the highest priority. The ailing joint institutions
under the post-Cotonou agreement, could be given new life in a decentralised form, by forming
institutions in the beneficiary country itself aimed at a more equal representation, dialogue and
co-management of the deep PTA. The legal regime of the partnership should spell out rights and
obligations in a legally binding and enforceable way. This should include the scope of governance
and mutual accountability by joint institutions and the level of contractual security, particularly
related to the financial resources provided (Mackie 2021). This way accountability and
transparency of trade for aid expenditures can also be enhanced. When it comes to dispute
settlement, the WTO-type ad hoc panel model is an often-used option, but some PTAs employ a
standing tribunal instead. A tribunal may involve more fixed investment in infrastructure than ad
hoc panels, but its permanence may make it available to take on more functions for the
integration process. The details of panel procedures can be left to be agreed later, although
negotiators can set key parameters in advance. Various approaches exist for dividing the
expenses of disputes, handling translation and documentation issues, and regulating
presentation of evidence and arguments;


**10)** **Restricted conditionality**


The deep PTA’s should be more relaxed on positive conditionality and aim for depoliticizing of the
agreement. Whereas the EU tends to see Article 96 of the Cotonou agreement as an important
and positive instrument to enforce the "essential elements" of the Cotonou Agreement such as
respect for human rights, the rule of law and democracy, the ACP side tends to view use of the
article as a "sanction" and "punishment" which is not conducive to overall relations between the
two sides (Hazelzet 2005). It reveals the paradox that development cooperation is most likely to


15


be withheld from those countries where the use of this foreign policy instrument is least likely to
have an impact. Consultations are mainly "successful" (in terms of leading to behavioural change
by the government) in cases where the government is willing to cooperate and cares for its
population, or where it is highly dependent on EU assistance. With some exceptions, this first
condition is unlikely to be met, since consultations are usually started following coups d'état or
fraudulent elections. The limitations of the consultation procedure must therefore be
acknowledged. And there are alternatives. In fact, the EU has tended to impose other sanctions
on the worst violators, often following UN Security Council resolutions. With the growing
"toolbox" of EU foreign policy instruments, in particular the new European Security Strategy and
the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), EU reactions to violations of human rights and
the rule of law are likely to become more sophisticated in the future (Hazelzet 2005).


The development effect of such deep PTA’s could be very substantial. Wilson et al. found that
enhanced port efficiency, less regulatory barriers, improvements in customs and greater e-business
have a large and positive effect on Trade. Intra-APEC trade [4] could increase by USD 254 billion. This
represents approximately a 21 percent increase in intra-APEC trade flows; about half coming from
improved port efficiencies in the region. Using Dollar and Kraay’s estimate of the effect of trade on
per capita GDP, these improvements in trade facilitation suggest an increase in APEC average per
capita GDP of 4.3 percent (Wilson et al. 2003).


The approach via bilateral deep PTA’s in global value chains, where the EU has a clear stake, is also
more in line with the new thinking about trade and aid. PTAs that are reciprocal, deeper, broader and
more enforceable. For example, the export coverage of reciprocal trade agreements (ie excluding
unilateral preference schemes such as the Generalised System of Preferences) increased from 50
percent of world trade in 2010 to 55 percent in 2020. The EU’s new development policy, new single
budget instrument and new development DG on international partnerships all point to a future
where the EU takes a stronger and more assertive stance on international partnerships with
development cooperation as one element of its toolbox. The Union is positioning itself as a proactive
partner, willing to abide by the new global consensus that the 2030 Agenda represents, but with
strong views of its own that it is not afraid to put forward and committed to full control over the
resources it devotes to development cooperation. The EU 2021 Trade Policy Review for a more
assertive trade policy includes a greater focus on preferential trade agreement implementation. An
analysis of preferential trade agreement implementation reports identifies challenges in
operationalising these. It shows that since 2019 there has been an increase in EU recourse to formal
dispute settlement mechanisms under preferential trade agreements demonstrating the shift to
greater assertiveness. Interestingly, most of the cases are of limited economic significance to the EU
but serve to reinforce the message of enforcement of trade rules (Garcia 2023).

# **V. Conclusion**


In this paper, we have focused on the preferential trade relations of the EU with the ACP countries on
the one hand, via the Lome and Cotonou agreements, and the LDC’s on the other, via the global GSP
system. This special and differential treatment of the poorest countries vis à vis other countries has
been justified by economic theories and policy statements that wanted to address the issue of
deteriorating terms of trade and encourage LDC’s through trade to develop their industrial base.


After more than half a century, the results have proven to be disappointing, both in terms of
development as well as in terms of good governance and human rights. There are numerous reasons


4 APEC; Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation.


16


for this weak performance. On the supply side, LDC’s often lack the infrastructure, know how and
finance to fully exploit the opportunity that trade preferences accord to them. On the demand side,
LDC’s face significant constraints such as strict Rules of Origin, Non-Tariff Barriers, Tariff escalation
and unfair competition by subsidized EU producers, both in home markets as well as in the EU.


If the EU truly wants to promote development through Preferential Trade Agreements, it should
design them in such a way that they may be more effective and powerful. This is the combination of
bilateral, “deep” comprehensive PTA’s based upon the nexus between trade, aid and investments
within global value chains and underpinned by strengthened economic governance.


Even though such deep PTA’s may undermine the ailing multilateral trade regime under the WTO and
be seen as highly asymmetrical in terms of power, these objections could be outweighed by the
advantages. LDC’s would be part of a much more strategic, comprehensive and beneficial trade
regime that gives them a chance to upgrade their private sector and add value to goods and services
within a protected environment. The deep PTA would also be more strategic to the EU partners who
aim to gain and secure preferential access to low-cost production sites in their supply chains by
signing PTAs, locking out third-country firms and thus ‘investing in protection’ that grants them a
competitive advantage. First, they eliminate tariffs between the signing partners – removing the
magnification effects and repercussions on domestic competitiveness that arise in an increasingly
competitive, global context. Second, deep PTAs act as a signalling and commitment device that can
remedy local institutional deficiencies: The deep PTA alters the Global South’s domestic policy
environment in a way that makes it safe for Northern high-tech and advanced firms to apply their
know-how in the South. It is hard to see how this might be possible in a multilateral/global (WTO),
continent wide (ACFTA) or regional (SADC, ECOWAS, ECA etc.) setting.


In view of the growing rivalry between the world’s major powers and the division of world trade in
regional “blocs”, it is imperative for the EU to secure its own critical supply chains with the Global
South on terms as beneficial to both sides as possible. To that end, the EPA’s could be reformed to
become no more than framework agreements, describing the political and economic foundations of
the agreement, while the deepening of trade, aid and investment as well as its differentiation, would
take place at the bilateral level of the deep PTA.
