feedback: In my opinion the vision for EU should educate people and allow them to
  discuss stuff. Nothing in EU will ever be sustainable unless we allow people to
  discuss and debate. Vaccine in EU was never allowed to be discussed. Nato in EU
  was never allowed to be discussed. Agriculture in EU was never allowed to be discussed.
  Stuff in EU will not become sustainable unless we allow discussions and debates.

llm_agreements: 'Both submissions stress the centrality of democratic engagement:
  they argue that public discussion, education and inclusive deliberation are necessary
  to achieve sustainable and legitimate EU policy outcomes. Each sees greater civic
  participation as a corrective to current policymaking practices and a prerequisite
  for durable decisions.'
llm_disagreements: 'They diverge on means and trust: one submission emphasizes structured,
  evidence-based mechanisms (strategic foresight, regulatory enforcement, mission-driven
  research and designed participatory processes) while the other calls for broadly
  opening up debate on contentious topics and implies current institutional suppression.
  The detailed submission prioritises technical, institutional and expert-led remedies
  alongside participatory forums, whereas the short submission focuses narrowly on
  unrestricted public debate without proposing technical governance or evidentiary
  frameworks.'
