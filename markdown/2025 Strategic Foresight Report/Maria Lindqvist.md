feedback: In my opinion the vision for EU should educate people and allow them to
  discuss stuff. Nothing in EU will ever be sustainable unless we allow people to
  discuss and debate. Vaccine in EU was never allowed to be discussed. Nato in EU
  was never allowed to be discussed. Agriculture in EU was never allowed to be discussed.
  Stuff in EU will not become sustainable unless we allow discussions and debates.
