feedback: Because the world is complex beyond our comprehension, we need to understand
  that policy is never perfect - there will always be problems, mistakes, errors,
  and bad bets. Instead of trying to be right, we should find better ways of creating
  policy experiments and to monitor them for errors and then correct those errors.
  Think less permanent in policy and more preliminary. The attitude should not be
  how do we prove that it works but rather how will we know if it doesnt work? Key
  to an approach such as this is to use foresight to define what would be required
  to falsify the assumptions underpinning the policy. This is the core of all knowledge
  creation, and knowledge creation is needed for progress and resilience. Such an
  attitude toward policy is more important than any single policy action.

llm_agreements: 'Both submissions prioritise strengthening strategic foresight and
  learning-by-doing: they support using foresight to monitor outcomes, generate early
  warnings, and adapt policy based on evidence. Each endorses iterative policy-making,
  emphasising experimentation, feedback loops and methods to detect when policies
  fail so they can be corrected promptly.'
llm_disagreements: 'One submission foregrounds a provisional, epistemic approach to
  policy—treating measures explicitly as experiments, centring falsification and lightweight,
  easily-reversible designs—while the other emphasises building durable institutional
  capacity (centralised enforcement, mission-driven research, procurement reform)
  and advancing specific sectoral strategies (AI, biotech, SRM, mental health). The
  difference is therefore mainly one of priority and emphasis: broad methodological
  humility and minimal permanence versus targeted, structural reforms and comprehensive
  governance frameworks.'
