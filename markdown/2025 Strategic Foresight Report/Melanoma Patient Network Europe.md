feedback: As a cancer patient advocate, I believe that strengthening Europe's resilience
  requires investing in science, the science of education and ethics to enhance the
  population's capacity for evidence-based thinking. Regardless of geography, science
  and education serve as vital foundations for progress and defend against misinformation
  and mass manipulation. Medical literature has shown us that pseudoscience and a
  lack of literacy contribute to poor health outcomes, including shorter survival
  in cancer patients. Similarly, societies that lack moral principles and critical
  thinking face democratic and economic instability. Today, the flood of unverified
  statements, conspiracy theories, and attacks on science and independent journalism
  make it increasingly difficult to combat misinformation effectively. To ensure Europe's
  future resilience, we must prioritize education at all levelsteaching children,
  young people, and adults (including politicians and other stakeholders) to critically
  assess information. We need sustainable, science-based movements that promote verifiable
  information and counteract misinformation. The same principles that help cancer
  patients live longerscientific literacy, evidence-based decisions, and ethical decisionsare
  also essential for protecting our societies from collapse. And ultimately, we need
  leaders who embody quality education and moral values as a foundation for a resilient
  and informed society.

llm_agreements: Both stress the central role of robust science, evidence-based decision-making,
  and ethics in strengthening European resilience. They agree on the need to invest
  in education and scientific literacy to counter misinformation and improve public
  health and democratic outcomes. Both call for sustained public engagement and leadership
  that embody moral values and critical thinking.
llm_disagreements: 'One submission takes a broad, systems-level approach that prioritises
  strategic foresight, technological sovereignty, defence and industrial policy, climate-intervention
  research/governance, and specific R&D and procurement reforms, while the other focuses
  narrowly on education, ethics and scientific literacy as the primary lever for resilience.
  There is a difference in emphasis on resource allocation and policy instruments:
  one advocates proactive research into potentially controversial technologies and
  institutional enforcement mechanisms, whereas the other prioritises societal-level
  literacy, ethics and countering pseudoscience without detailing techno-industrial
  or security measures.'
