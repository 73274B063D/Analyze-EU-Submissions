feedback: 'In 2020, the EU Strategic Foresight report was about resilience. In response
  to this impressive work, Luxembourg Strategy (2021-2024), the former Strategic Foresight
  Directorate of the Ministry of the Economy, published a scientific article comparing
  those indicators with the national competitiveness and sustainability indicators.
  The article can be accessed here: https://odc.gouvernement.lu/en/publications/rapport-etude-analyse/perspectives-politique-economique/ppe-037.html
  Meanwhile we have proceeded with the analysis of what a future resilient economy
  could look like. As a resources-poor continent, it is difficult for EU to compete
  with resources-rich countries. Therefore rather than competition, critical sufficiency
  (energy, food, water, materials, ..) and vital sovereignty (data, Ai, defence ...)
  and relying on its strengths (education, infastructure, culture, languages, environmental
  protection, territorial adaptation to climate disruption, ...) seem key. In this
  respect, the Luxembourg Ministry of the Economy has developed 5 scenarios for the
  NEXTGEN Infrastructures, here: https://meco.gouvernement.lu/fr/domaines-activites/prospective/luxembourg-strategie/analyses/infra2100.html
  and assessed the ESPAS Global Trend for their relevance to the Luxembourg economy
  (see file attached, work in progress). Thank you for your attention'

# **Grand Duchy of Luxembourg** **Ministry of the Economy** **GLOBAL MEGATRENDS ANALYSIS** **(2025)**
## **Lessons from the EU Global Trends 2040** **for the Luxembourg Economy**



Ref. Ares(2025)2244160 - 19/03/2025



**What is this booklet about?**

The EUROPEAN STRATEGY AND POLICY ANALYSIS SYSTEM (ESPAS) publishes every 5 years a Global Trends Report for the next 15 years,
ahead of the renewal of the EU Commission and Parliament.


The Luxembourg Ministry of the Economy has analysed the 10 megatrends (MT) identified by ESPAS in its Global Trends Report 2024 [1]
for 2040 with respect to their relevance and importance for the Luxembourg economy. The result is a concise Megatrends Booklet for
the use of the Ministry’s agents in their strategic outlook and planning practices.


This **Megatrends Booklet (2025)** complies 10 impact sheets, one for each of the 10 MT identified and discussed by ESPAS and which
are the following:


1/10: Geopolitical chessboard: a world in flux
2/10: Mounting pressures on economic growth
3/10: Uneven demographic ramifications
4/10: Environmental emergency
5/10: Energy transition
6/10: Equality: a complex and multidimensional picture
7/10: Nexus of technological convergence and acceleration
8/10: Health: a global challenge
9/10: What will change in how we live and work?
10/10: Democracy between threats and renewal

**Foresight method and deliverables**

Each of these 10 MT is assessed for its relevance to the Luxembourg economy and for its coherence with other major global MT
publications. The template for this assessment is adapted from the Megatrends Analysis Sheet developed by the Australian Prime
Minister’s Office (2024). [ 2] Behind this simple 1-page presentation lies a continuous process of global trends inventory, comparison and
signals assessment.

To evolve from the big picture of global MT to a manageable picture of national economy-relevant trends and their implications, the
following prior steps have been implemented in order to provide the Luxembourg Ministry of the Economy with a minimal internal
foresight service while avoiding information overload for the users:


  - Identify and collect megatrends, as published by international authoritative institutions and private sector agencies

  - Characterise, analyse and continuously monitor megatrends

  - Select the megatrends potentially relevant for the Luxembourg economy and its industry segments, including, where
available, those with quantitative/qualitative data on Luxembourg

  - Present and share the synthesis of this work

**Acronyms**


CCS(U) Carbon Capture and Storage (and Use)

NECP National Energy and Climate Plan
H2 Hydrogen

RE Renewable Energies

WEF World Economic Forum

**Limitations**

Considering the resources at hand, the result of this process is not a comprehensive, dynamic or collaborative megatrend (MT) analysis,
but rather an informed snapshot of existing MT observations generated by other entities. Also, separating MTs for the sake of
presentation risks to distort their complex and interconnected nature. The process has not benefited from participative in person
discussions, collective in-house or industry wide assessments, confrontation with the operational economic realities and experience
of external foresight institutions or consensus finding team exercises. Data have been manually compiled from available literature. No
digital foresight scanning or dynamic real time radar have been used. The findings are not visualised or graphically embellished. Given
this, and despite the structured and rigorous method applied, the deliverables are not contextual products which tie into
organisational plans and strategies

A regular update of the booklet would help to keep up with the fast evolving, disruptive events of our time.

The deliverables do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the Luxembourg Ministry of the Economy.

Nurture themclxxxv and ensure human<br>control over people’s data (See MT democracy).<br>• Strengthen non-profit associations, communities of<br>practices, DIY groups, arts/media alliances to create<br>and help new social movements.<br>• Include futures as we include history in school<br>curriculum. Teach alternative visions of the<br>future.clxxxvi <br>• Offer jobs-that-make-senseclxxxvii and protect<br>workers from climate change physical risks (climate<br>leave._Hitzefrei_, protection from wet bulb effect,<br>…)clxxxviii <br>• Orientate youth and continual training towards<br>green and manual jobsclxxxix <br>• Protect architectural heritage, renovate old instead<br>of building new, to give sense of community<br>identity and belonging<br>• Flexible transitions between working life and<br>retirement (part-time work for a partial pension.<br>earlier retirement for lower pension...).<br>• Improve working conditions to counter physical and<br>mental degradations<br>• Demystify AI, reclaim autonomy back and make<br>informed decisions about tech, put ethical and<br>moral judgment first, do critical AI literacy and<br>question who benefits from AI?cxc <br> <br>Threats:<br> <br>• As a result of AI and automation, massive<br>unemployment causes societal and political turmoil<br>and conflict between technologically augmented<br>humans (via AI, genetics, electronics or other<br>means) and non-augmented citizenscxci <br>Psychological burden of feeling obsolete and of<br>having no control over one’s data.<br>• AI and automation do not bring back productivity,<br>exclusively focused on max profits. Technology<br>favoured by men over women. Men/women,<br>old/young, West/Est … inhabit separate virtual<br>bubbles.<br>• Data protection made impossible by quantum<br>computing, banks and security exposed.cxcii <br>• US gov. attacks public servants, scientists, rangers,<br>workers, human, env rights…<br>• Heat, food and water stress rise, esp. in big cities<br>• Destruction of cultural heritage and community<br>identity to solve the housing crisis by building new<br>instead of restoring old.<br>• Among sources of hope, 'successful political<br>engagement” comes last, something worrisomecxciii <br>• Ageing population and youth in distress have no<br>supportcxciv <br>|

[cclxx Edelman Trustbarometer](http://www.edelman.com/trust/2025/trust-barometer) 2025: Majority hold grievances against government, business, and the rich. 61% globally have a moderate or high sense of **grievance**,

which is defined by a belief that government and business make their lives harder and serve narrow interests, and wealthy people benefit unfairly from the system.
Those with a high sense of grievance **distrust** all four institutions (business, government, media, and NGOs). **Hostile activism** is seen as a legitimate tool to drive
change. To bring about change, 4 in 10 would approve of one or more of the following forms of hostile activism: attacking people online, intentionally spreading
disinformation, threatening or committing violence, damaging public or private property. This sentiment is most prevalent among respondents ages 18-34 (53 %
approve of at least one). Low income mired in distrust. Business is 16 points less trusted among low income respondents than among high income respondents.
