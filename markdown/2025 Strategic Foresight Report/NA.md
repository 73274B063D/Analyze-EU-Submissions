llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise strengthening EU resilience, defending
  European democratic values, and adapting governance to rapid technological change.
  They agree on the need to harness digital and scientific capabilities to improve
  public services and societal wellbeing, including reforms to make institutions more
  effective and citizens more digitally literate.
llm_disagreements: 'Submission A emphasises precaution, stronger regulatory enforcement,
  targeted strategic investments (e.g., AI infrastructure, biofoundries), and explicit
  climate-intervention governance, while Submission B prioritises rapid technology
  adoption, procedural simplification, periodic re-evaluation of regulations, and
  efficiency gains with less emphasis on precaution. They also differ on specificity
  and scope: A advances detailed security, procurement and bio/ climate policy proposals;
  B remains high-level and focused on cultural/administrative adaptation and openness
  to trade-offs for innovation.'

Response to: 2025 Strategic Foresight Report focus on resilience


For long term resilience of EU, I propose the Strategic Foresight Report should
consider how EU could take active role in changing world and on upcoming
challenges. Not just to follow megatrends. EU and European Commission have
evolved as organizations far beyond what an individual person or even a country
can do as an entity. Significant part of human progress is the ability to create
these entities and work together with them. However, a single human is far too
easily affected by targeted external influence, where as we as EU, can have the
collected knowledge to survive and thrive. As an example, European Commission
evaluation process is currently based on multiple independent technical experts
to combine the result based on strictly technical & scientific details, with
minimization of personal or emotional biases.


United in diversity
Nations and EU are ‘stories’ which we human build to work together. This story
is bound to change, but understanding if & how it is changing, is critical to be
kept in our own non-biased hands. External nations and actors like to change the
story of EU for their benefit, and in individual level immigrants may want to
change it to reflect their world view. But it is plausible to get the
definitions only from within EU. Despite anti-immigration opinions, which may be
amplified in extremism of the message, maybe we as EU can define contemporary
guidelines what we, as EU, are and what is accepted by everyone. Deep symptoms
of ill-reactions should be treated, not silenced. EU should have a strategy for
maintaining its the human values and other goals despite the external influence
and pressure, and thus gain resilience by communicating and knowledgeable
citizens.


Always under construction
With the emergence of generative AI, ever more effective personal targeting in
large populations, and social media influencing, the nature of democracy in
bound to change. Large scale democracy was not practical >2000 y ago, and as we
have it now, may not be best way to do it in future. This is reflected by the
decreasing interest in democratic processes, such as voting, and lack of
countability (vs. the per-election campaigning words) in evermore complex
topics. New ways of working together must be sought after and tested, to be best
resilience in the changing world.
Are we to follow global trends and economical & political forces, which may be
baths laid by the other largest global players? (Militarization, increasing
inequality) That’s NOT what vast majority of unbiased people anywhere would
want. And we must remember that such biasing is often also a social phenomenon.
Still, we must be able to defend our borders, while remembering that globally
majority of the unbiased people do not want conflict or war.
EU can show an example when we have shown first that there are other solutions
than conflict.


Big part of this is likely to be the changing meaning of work and its relevance
to individuals and society. Universal basic income, lifetime learning, new
methods of education, mental health and wellness and social belong, as an
examples, are recognized topics. Since such changes, or progress, is coming
anyway then shouldn't it be the most resilient way to adopt to them rather
sooner than later?


“Rest of the world in innovating, but Europe is regulating” (Why the ….)


a) Regulations are in most cases needed to protect and enable collaboration –
but the reasons should be list and re-evaluated periodically (We can create
nowadays documents with links etc. to describe background and purposes or
regulations. Are there any good reason why not to use them?) Thus, the
regulations should be open for questioning, critique and improvements, as any
science is.
b) Intension of the regulation, not the word of it. Reconsidering applicability
of regulations, like farming & foresting in Finland with EU-regulation. The
process and the form of regulations does not work adequately, if & when ‘common
sense’ per applicable area is less relevant than voting power of majority. E.g.
due Europe’s diversity, a single number as objective to forest protection, may
not be the relevant or best objective. Questioning the objective should be
always the option.
c) Embrace the technology. Official forms and applications vary, but
electronically applied e.g. driving license in Finland is not any worse than
application with lots of papers in some other country. Why? Use the information
technology, known good processes (and tested & secure) to make:

- More efficient process/work/action; If software and interlinked computers can
do it, then why any ‘certificate’ is needed to be added by a human -> Innovate,
improved, make progress. You should be able use paper forms if you really like,
but see situation in e.g. Ukraine and how many things have been transferred to
online to make things work.

- More humane process/work/action – what is actually relevant for driving
license renewing? Why (all the reasons) it could not be automatic, if the data
of such as person’s health is anyway measure recently by work-health care? The
relevant information is already there.
Resilience can rise from efficiency and technical innovations.


But as part of the fore-mentioned processes, democracy or bureaucracy, people
must have choice. As an example, you should be able fill the papers in old way,
or use the new system. Such new systems are not possible for everybody to use,
and possibility of technical distributions should be mitigated. However, in
larger scale, to be resilient as Europe, we have to actively learn from
successful models (like Finnish housing system, or even US-capital markets,
etc.) and implement. And always look for ever better models. We should recognise
that wide adaptation of such methods is balance of resilience, efficiency and in
a way, bureaucracy.


Is ‘China’ doing something wrong when Temu etc. are selling low-cost items to
Europe? Reasons for its success likely include such as: Business model, product
designs, lower labour cost, innovation and efficiency in sales & logistics, and
economy of scale! These include progress. We should NOT fight the progress, that
it a part of human endeavours. However, as there may be things wrong from
European perspective in areas like human workforce exploitation or environmental
protection. These should be valuated in the cost, preferably case-by-case. In
order to be resilient, we have to embrace the progress.
In order to match the European values, the product cost can be adjusted. The
product value, e.g. relevant import tariffs should be developed and implemented
based on real details (including non-economic factors) to guide the market. Any
such action should be based on real values and not just to protect existing
structures and old business models. New models should be adaptive, not my just
compromise, (like early CO2 credit limits EU & industry). Best model can help
reshape the world outside EU too, like RoHS.


Thus, I prose Strategic Foresight Report should address European resilience in
long term via progress though EU’s science, technology and organizations, and
also with means of non-biased, objective human(istic) point of view. As an
example, in AI: “Use it or lose it (the business)” - That’s most likely how it’s
going to be. Within limits of safe use, its adaptation is progress. Likewise,
CRISPR-Cas and other wonders science and technology.
