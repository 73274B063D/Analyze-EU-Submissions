feedback: First, I would like to point out that European resilience in Heavy Rare
  Earth Minerals is terrible and that this is China's equivalent to the oil and gas
  weapon Russia wielded. Greenland's HREE deposits must be commercialized as soon
  as possible and HREE refining capacity should have strategic priority and full backing
  of the state. Second, Europe should aggressively pursue energy independence through
  SMR's. I recommend also aggressive fast-tracking of permits here or otherwise build
  them on military domains to exempt them from civilian permitting restrictions. Third,
  Europe should use tariffs to bring critical supply chains home rather than subsidies.
  This can work for cloud infrastructure, chip production, drone components, EV components
  and pharmaceutical precursors. One should also consider eliminating net neutrality
  and slowing down access to foreign digital services (bandwidth tariffs). This will
  stimulate the growth of EU-based social media platforms and their respective R&D
  investments. Fourth, before leaning into tariffs it would be best to fix the European
  equity capital markets but also the specialty debt finance markets. The last is
  not currently on the EU's radar but specialty debt (venture debt, equipment finance,
  franchise finance, revenue financing, asset backed lending, capex financing,...)
  is key to scaleups and very important for capital intensive companies to scale such
  as public cloud infrastructure. Capital intense sectors are heavily disadvantaged
  in Europe to the point that VC's avoid it like the plague.

llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise European strategic autonomy in critical
  technologies and supply chains and call for stronger domestic capacity in areas
  such as advanced industry, energy and defence-related sectors. They also converge
  on the need to mobilise financing and policy levers (procurement, targeted investment,
  and capital-market reforms) to scale up strategic industries and make Europe more
  competitive globally.
llm_disagreements: 'They sharply diverge on means and safeguards: one submission advocates
  aggressive, protectionist and expedient measures (tariffs, rapid commercialisation
  of mineral deposits, fast-tracked permits including use of military domains, and
  removing net neutrality) to onshore capacity, while the other emphasises democratic
  oversight, environmental and intergenerational safeguards, multilateral governance,
  precaution, and transparent public-interest research and enforcement. They also
  differ in stance toward regulatory trade‑offs—prioritising unilateral industrial
  expediency versus balanced, rights‑based and deliberative policy-making.'
