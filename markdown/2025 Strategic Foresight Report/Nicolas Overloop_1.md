feedback: The EU is very fragile due to its internal fragmentation, yet access to
  the European market is one of the most important geopolitical objectives for both
  the US, China, and India and any trade block. China has been investing significantly
  in port infrastructure around the world to avoid being isolated by a trade blockade
  in the south china sea and areas in the event of a conflict. If a war between China
  and the US breaks out, the war will be heavily fought over control of trade routes
  and the ability to deny its use to the adversary. Both India and Europa are completely
  powerless in this potential conflict. While we do have bases and island chains still
  around the world from our colonial days, we do not have a fleet to keep trade routes
  open and to deny blockades. Neither do we have the planes to defend those islands.
  I would like Europe to consider what its options are if the US starts a war with
  China and forces Europe into seizing its trade with any China supporter. Likewise,
  what if China wants to force EU into compliance by shutting down access to entire
  continents (e.g. deny seafaring through the Suez canal through its bases in Africa).
  If you look at the map then the US is almost capable of completely denying EU-China
  trade and also China can cut off significant amount of trade from the EU as they
  have sufficient bases in Africa to interdict Suez canal traffic and Cape of good
  horn traffic. They also have bases at the south of India and in Pakistan which means
  they can interdict India-EU trade. The assumption has always been that we will side
  with the US and that's still the most likely option but we should really have a
  choice in this matter when the time comes. Europe should leverage Ukraine's naval
  drone technology and develop larger ships that can launch them that look like commercial
  ships (e.g. a container ship with one naval drone per container). This, together
  with a buildout on historical territories of European countries would enable a European
  drone fleet to enact sea denial in retaliation. The EU should also create drone
  jets that can deliver a weapon payload and return to base, sort of like a mini strategic
  bomber. We can leverage Ukraine's cheap long-range cruise missiles for that. In
  General, the EU should triple down on investing in Ukraine's defense industry as
  their innovations are key to the long-term security and trade route security of
  Europe. Luckily for the EU, large ships such as aircraft carriers and destroyers
  are no longer relevant and we have an industry in Europe that is the world leader
  in naval drones. Last, the EU should open its own bases along key chokepoints such
  as Cape horn (Falklands), Cape of good hope (SA), Suez, Greenland (Northern sea
  route),... If we don't we (and India) risk to lose freedom of navigation and with
  that freedom to choose our own destiny and become a pawn of two superpowers. Sadly
  the international rule-based order is dead, we should secure our vital trade routes
  with hard power instead. That said, we should absolutely fix our internal fragmentation
  as well. A hostile China can easily bribe individual leaders/countries to avoid
  a unified European response. We are in a very short timeframe where our potential
  adversaries believe that Europe will never unite and can always be managed through
  exploiting divisions. The Polish Lithuanian commonwealth and its Liberum veto is
  a cautionary tale. That's why I believe we should give the EU commission the broadest
  democratic mandate possible and that's only possible if its leader is directly elected
  across the entire continent. Since proportional electoral colleges don't really
  work (too much incentive for block-forming) I propose that such a leader would be
  elected through instant-run off voting. A leader elected in such a way has the broadest
  possible democratic mandate. This is also needed to stimulate a lot of political
  debate over what kind of Europe we actually want in the nation states.
