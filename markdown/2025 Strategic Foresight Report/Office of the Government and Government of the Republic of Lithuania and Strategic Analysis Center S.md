llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise strengthening EU resilience through improved
  strategic foresight, early-warning/monitoring systems, and better use of technological
  tools (including AI) to make foresight outputs more actionable. They agree on the
  need to bolster productive capacities and supply-chain resilience, adopt whole-of-society
  approaches to preparedness, and translate foresight into policy-relevant indicators
  and response options.
llm_disagreements: 'The submissions differ in emphasis: one places stronger weight
  on intergenerational equity, mental-health impacts of digital technologies, governance
  and research on climate interventions (SRM), biofoundries/biosecurity, and building
  pan‑European R&D institutions and procurement reform; the other focuses more on
  operational resilience across peacetime/crisis/conflict, harmonised resilience indicators,
  civil‑protection baselines, empowering vulnerable groups (including gender dimensions),
  and region‑specific security threats. They also diverge on time-horizon and use
  of foresight: one stresses long-term systemic governance and precautionary research
  agendas, while the other prioritises short-to-medium-term, actionable, iterative
  foresight exercises and real‑time monitoring for policy response.'

**A joint contribution to the Public Consultation for the Strategic Foresight Report 2025**


**2025 March 18**


_**Scope:**_ _what are the main challenges to long-term EU resilience and what are the strengths on_
_which Europe can build it?_

The approach to securing the EU’s long-term resilience should cover three dimensions:


  - **Resilience in peacetime.** Even if the high probability of military conflict or extreme situations
does not materialize, “peace” in the future will not be restful. Long-term structural trends, from
technology to climate change to demographics – will continuously supply disruptions or
pressures that may threaten the normal functioning of the society without amounting to a severe
crisis or taking the form of conflict. In this context, strengthening the capacity for **iterative**
**adaptation** will be crucial. The EU’s ability to tap into the experience and best practices of
various stakeholders – civil society, businesses, communities, local governments, regions,
member states, transnational organizations, and the EU institutions themselves – will be an
important resource. Creating appropriate formats and decision-making algorithms on how to
identify, disseminate, or scale-up proven solutions to peacetime challenges will be a key task to
utilize the resource better.


  - **Resilience in crisis moments.** The polycrisis environment will require a different approach to
crisis management: 1) the polycrisis means that even when an individual crisis is resolved, the
state / society does not return to an absence of crisis 2) the polycrisis generates endogenous
dynamics, such as spillovers or feedback loops, the effects of which may not be resolved with
the instruments designed for a specific crisis, and 3) it complicates forecasting of individual
crises and makes resource pre-allocation for individual crisis management tactics (e.g.,
stockpiling, diversification) more difficult. This will increase the need to **invest in the**
**fundamental sources of state and societal resilience** (“no loss investments”), such as civil
society, education, social cohesion, governance capacity building. The European social model
and the EU’s flexible decision-making are important resources to draw on.


  - **Resilience in conflict.** With the return of geopolitical competition, the ability to withstand,
counter, deter, or absorb direct attacks on Europe – whether with hybrid, economic, or
conventional means – will become central to the EU’s future. The all-encompassing nature of
modern conflict (that blends military forces with economic coercion and influence tactics) will
require a “whole-of-Union”, “whole-of-government” and “whole-of-society” approach:
responses will have to be coordinated across and within the multi-level governance system.


_**Long-term resilience:**_ _Which critical policy actions should be initiated today to strengthen_
_resilience in the EU by 2040?_


  - Establish a unified system for monitoring the resilience of Europe’s vital systems (e.g., climate
and environment, democratic institutions and society, public and social services, critical
infrastructure, defence capacities, societal resilience). This will require harmonizing the
definitions of resilience across the EU, creating a set of universally recognized resilience
indicators, and ensuring proper data collection, monitoring, and interpretation capacities. To
avoid undue administrative burden and ensure real-time monitoring, this should utilize available
and emerging data processing and analysis technologies, including AI solutions.


  - Establish common baselines for civil protection assessment and crisis preparedness. Make “as
strong as our weakest link” a paradigm for resilience building, namely by ensuring dedicated
support systems for at-risk and vulnerable groups. Recognize and empower the role of women
in resilience building.


  - Invest in Europe’s productive capacities to strengthen the resilience of the Single Market to
disruptions in production and supply chains due to the deliberate actions of hostile actors and
the unwarranted dependence on autocratic regimes.


_**Enhancing strategic foresight:**_ _How could the European Commission further improve its approach to_
_strategic foresight to increase its impact on designing EU policies for a desirable future?_


We agree with the Sauli Niinisto’s report "Safer Together” that the EU’s strategic foresight ecosystem
needs to focus on making strategic foresight outputs more actionable and solutions oriented. To this
end, in 2024 Lithuania conducted a strategic foresight exercise to stress-testing Lithuania’s mediumterm security strategies with the aim to develop indicators for risk monitoring and corresponding policy
response menus. We hosted multiple online workshops with about 200 civil society, academia, business
community, and public sector experts and representatives, using AI-based tools for trends analysis and
event aggregation. We believe that reorienting foresight to the short-to-medium term political priorities
and leveraging technological tools to facilitate collaborative works among many stakeholders (as
opposed to in-person workshops, which are inherently limited in size) are crucial to ensure that
foresight responds to the political moment and delivers on its promise to tap into ‘collective
intelligence’ about the future. The intermediary product of our exercise – alternative disruption
scenarios to Lithuania’s long-term security and resilience – has been made publicly available to foster
further discussion on the topic. [1]

Our exercise developed a security radar, in which potential challenges to Lithuania’s security were
categorized by risk level and Lithuania’s current preparedness:


**The main risks identified were:**




- Ukraine’s Defeat

- Russia’s Direct Aggression

- Nuclear Accident

- Nuclear War

- Ageing Population

- Emigration & Depopulation

- Critical Infrastructure Attacks

- Inequality & Poverty

- Climate Refugees and Migration




- Dissolution of NATO

- War in Europe

- China and Russia Joining Forces

- Disinformation

- Dependency on Grids

- Religious Fundamentalism

- AI-Driven Mass Misinformation

- Hybrid Warfare



The exercise also identified **key** **opportunities for Lithuania, for which the country should prepare:**




- EU Taxonomy for Sustainable
Activities

- Decline of EROI

- Restraining Emissions

- Carbon Dioxide Removal

- Military and Police Drones

- Culture of Preparedness

- Regime Change in Belarus

- Regime Change in Russia




- Collapse of Russia

- Federalisation of the EU

- Lab-Grown Foods

- Robotics and Automation

- Biocomputing

- Quantum Computers

- Cleantech

- Teaching and Learning 2.0



After grouping and analysing the identified trends, several overarching themes emerged as the most
**critical for Lithuania’s security and resilience** :


  - **Changing Nature of War**   - The evolution of warfare, including hybrid threats, drone warfare,
and AI-driven misinformation, is reshaping security landscapes.

  - **Navigating the Clean Energy Transition**   - The shift to sustainable energy presents both
geopolitical risks and economic opportunities, influencing Lithuania’s energy independence.

  - **Roll-out of Breakthrough Technologies**   - Emerging innovations, such as quantum computing,
biocomputing, and automation, could significantly alter national security, governance, and
economic competitiveness.

  - **Eroding Power of the Euro-Atlantic Community**   - The stability of NATO and the EU
remains uncertain amid rising geopolitical tensions, requiring strategic foresight and
adaptability.

  - **Fragility of Regimes in the Eastern Neighbourhood**   - Potential political shifts in Belarus and
Russia, alongside broader instability in the region, could create both security risks and
opportunities.

  - **Socioeconomic and Demographic Changes**   - Factors such as aging populations, migration,
inequality, and depopulation will influence Lithuania’s long-term resilience and social cohesion.
