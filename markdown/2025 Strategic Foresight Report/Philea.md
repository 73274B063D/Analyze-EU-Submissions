# **Response to the 2025 Strategic Foresight Report**

Philanthropy Europe Association


**Response to the "2025 Strategic Foresight Report"** **Consultation**


**I.** **Who we are**


Philea, the Philanthropy Europe Association, represents 7,500 philanthropic
organisations from across Europe, united in contributing to pluralistic, just and
resilient societies that centre people and planet. Philanthropy refers to
foundations, philanthropic organisations, corporate and individual funders
using their own financial and non-financial resources for the public good.
Philanthropic organisations support programmes in areas from which we all
benefit, such as education, health, science, research, environment, culture and
international development. It works alongside and in partnership with other
civil society organisations, governments and private sector initiatives. A unique
characteristic of philanthropic organisations/foundations is the ability to
respond with agility to the critical challenges facing our societies, while
simultaneously taking a longer-term view of their causes.


Philea also hosts a group of Enterprise Foundations. These foundations, in
addition to their philanthropic activities, own some of Europe's largest
enterprises, thereby ensuring the long-term ownership and sustainability of
these highly successful companies. The competitiveness of these Europeanbased enterprises is crucial to the prosperity of Europe. Therefore, initiatives
aimed at improving or strengthening their competitiveness are both
fundamental and highly significant.


As Philea, we are also actively engaging as a board member of Social Economy
Europe (SEE) around the wider social economy agenda and also with the wider
civil society community on issues of common concern. We are a member of
the European Expert Group on Social Economy (GECES) and have also been
contributing to the social economy agenda from the perspective of
philanthropy and foundations in this context.


**II.** **General remarks on the importance of strategic foresight**


Philea is pleased to contribute to this important initiative to engage citizens
and stakeholders in shaping EU decision-making through strategic foresight is
both timely and necessary. As global challenges such as climate change,
demographic shifts, economic inequalities, and technological disruptions
continue to evolve, it is crucial that the EU adopts a long-term, evidence-based

intelligence and build a resilient future, the Commission must foster an
enabling environment that allows philanthropy, civil society, and other
stakeholders to act and engage alongside policymakers as partners.


The [European Philanthropy Manifesto](https://philea.eu/how-we-can-help/policy-and-advocacy/european-philanthropy-manifesto/) outlines the critical steps needed to
create a Single Market for Philanthropy, reducing administrative, legal, and
fiscal barriers that currently restrict cross-border philanthropic action. This
aligns directly with the EU’s strategic foresight agenda, as foresight requires
multi-stakeholder collaboration, long-term investments, and adaptive policy
frameworks to anticipate and address emerging challenges effectively. By

risk-taking and innovative potential of philanthropy and how funders are
acting for Europe’s today and tomorrow.


**III.** **Key arguments:**


Philanthropy’s Role in Strategic Foresight


Philanthropy plays a crucial role in funding long-term, risk-tolerant initiatives
that anticipate future challenges. Its ability to invest in emerging trends and
experimental solutions allows the EU to explore innovative paths toward

resilience and tackle complex, long-term issues that require foresight and
flexibility.


Enhancing Cross-Border Collaboration


Currently, legal and regulatory barriers can limit philanthropy’s ability to
operate across borders. By simplifying these restrictions, philanthropy could
enhance cross-border collaboration and act as a partner, helping to align
efforts and share resources in ways that strengthen EU-wide resilience and
support shared policy goals.


Advancing Social Innovation and Systems Change


Philanthropy is well-positioned to support social innovations that drive
systemic change. By investing in grassroots solutions and long-term capacity
building, philanthropy can contribute to the EU’s broader efforts to address
economic, social, and environmental challenges in a way that fosters
sustainable transformation.


Broadening Futures Thinking


EU foresight processes provide valuable institutional insights, but they can be
strengthened by integrating broader perspectives. Philanthropy can act as a
bridge between governments, communities, and academia, helping to
ensure that futures thinking is inclusive, adaptive, and responsive to diverse
needs and experiences.


Promoting Intergenerational Fairness


Philanthropy has long supported initiatives focused on youth empowerment
and sustainability, which are essential for intergenerational fairness. By
fostering greater cross-border collaboration and aligning efforts with EU
policy, philanthropy can help ensure that decisions made today are inclusive,
forward-thinking, and responsive to the needs of future generations .


**IV.** **Conclusion**


In an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world, the EU’s ability
to anticipate and adapt to future challenges is more critical than ever. Strategic
foresight offers the tools and methodologies necessary to navigate this uncertainty,
ensuring the long-term resilience of the EU across multiple domains. However, to
truly strengthen resilience, the EU must go beyond traditional approaches and
embrace innovative, inclusive, and cross-sector strategies that engage a broad range
of stakeholders, including philanthropy.

**Response to the "Single market strategy 2025"** **Consultation**


Strategic foresight, when effectively harnessed, offers the EU the opportunity to build
a more sustainable, adaptive, and forward-thinking future for all its citizens. As we
look toward 2040, these policy actions will help ensure that the EU is not just
prepared for the future but actively shaping it in a way that is resilient, inclusive, and
fair.
