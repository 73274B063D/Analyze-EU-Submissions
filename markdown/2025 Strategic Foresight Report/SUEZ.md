feedback: 'Water resilience is one of todays biggest challenges. Climate change, causing
  water stress, associated with increasing industrial demand for water, are forcing
  us to rethink how we treat water, both from a quantity and quality point of view.
  To meet these current and future challenges, it is crucial to deliver on a strong
  and ambitious European Water Resilience Strategy. This urgency affects everyone,
  at all levels and across all sectors. It is therefore essential that the cross-cutting
  nature of water is considered through strengthened governance and the development
  of stronger synergies between EU policies. As governance at the basin level can
  present challenges for regions and Member States, it is crucial to reinforce transboundary
  cooperation at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels, with mutual and
  harmonised processes and obligations. The European Commission must as well ensure
  that obligations related to water availability and quality are fully enforced in
  the EU, by better controlling the implementation of existing water policies. Furthermore,
  the EU must prioritise circular solutions, such as the reuse of treated wastewater,
  encourage aquifer recharge to maintain groundwater levels, combat leaks in water
  networks, and encourage the digitalization of water management processes. Finally,
  the EU should push Member States to rethink the price value of water to promote
  a more rationale use of the resource. The selling price of water is currently too
  low to enable water management operators to effectively fulfil their mission: ensuring
  a sufficient supply of quality water both today and in the future. The undervaluation
  of water hinders the investment opportunities needed for the deployment of necessary
  infrastructures and the development of innovative water-smart solutions.'

llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise strengthening governance and enforcement
  to improve resilience and call for cross‑cutting, integrated policy approaches that
  connect climate risks with sectoral responses. They agree on the need for investment
  in infrastructure and innovation, including digitalisation and circular solutions
  (e.g., reuse, resource efficiency), to increase long‑term resilience. Both stress
  the importance of transboundary cooperation and better implementation of existing
  policy tools to manage climate‑driven resource challenges.
llm_disagreements: 'The other organisation focuses narrowly on operational water‑sector
  measures (pricing reform, leak control, aquifer recharge, treated wastewater reuse
  and basin‑level governance) and on market/investment levers to enable infrastructure
  deployment. The submission emphasises high‑level strategic foresight, emerging technology
  governance (AI, SRM, biotech, neurotech), intergenerational fairness, and precautionary
  democratic oversight, which are broader systemic priorities and may conflict with
  purely market‑based or rapid deployment approaches; there is also potential tension
  around water pricing and equity versus investment needs. Finally, the two differ
  in time horizon and emphasis: one prioritises immediate, sectoral operational fixes
  while the other prioritises long‑term systemic governance, R&D, and precautionary
  research agendas.'
