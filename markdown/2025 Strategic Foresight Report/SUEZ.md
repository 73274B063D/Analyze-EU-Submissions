feedback: 'Water resilience is one of todays biggest challenges. Climate change, causing
  water stress, associated with increasing industrial demand for water, are forcing
  us to rethink how we treat water, both from a quantity and quality point of view.
  To meet these current and future challenges, it is crucial to deliver on a strong
  and ambitious European Water Resilience Strategy. This urgency affects everyone,
  at all levels and across all sectors. It is therefore essential that the cross-cutting
  nature of water is considered through strengthened governance and the development
  of stronger synergies between EU policies. As governance at the basin level can
  present challenges for regions and Member States, it is crucial to reinforce transboundary
  cooperation at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels, with mutual and
  harmonised processes and obligations. The European Commission must as well ensure
  that obligations related to water availability and quality are fully enforced in
  the EU, by better controlling the implementation of existing water policies. Furthermore,
  the EU must prioritise circular solutions, such as the reuse of treated wastewater,
  encourage aquifer recharge to maintain groundwater levels, combat leaks in water
  networks, and encourage the digitalization of water management processes. Finally,
  the EU should push Member States to rethink the price value of water to promote
  a more rationale use of the resource. The selling price of water is currently too
  low to enable water management operators to effectively fulfil their mission: ensuring
  a sufficient supply of quality water both today and in the future. The undervaluation
  of water hinders the investment opportunities needed for the deployment of necessary
  infrastructures and the development of innovative water-smart solutions.'
