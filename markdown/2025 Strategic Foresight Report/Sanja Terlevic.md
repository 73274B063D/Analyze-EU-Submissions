llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise strengthening democratic legitimacy of
  policymaking through meaningful citizen inclusion and participatory processes, including
  mechanisms for public engagement and deliberation. They also converge on the need
  for adaptive, experimental policy tools (e.g., safe/controlled experimentation or
  sandboxes) and agile policy frameworks that can respond quickly to emerging challenges
  while maintaining democratic standards.
llm_disagreements: Submission A places strong emphasis on specific technical and security
  priorities — enforcement capacity, strategic R&D investment, procurement reform,
  tech and defence sovereignty, biosecurity, and governance/research of climate interventions
  (SRM) — and prescribes concrete institutional and funding measures. Submission B
  is high-level and primarily concentrates on accessibility, co‑creation, and low‑risk
  policy experimentation without advancing sector‑specific security, industrial or
  scientific governance prescriptions.

# **EU 2025 Strategic Foresight Report consultation**


**Background:**
_[Imagine 2040: Building the Future with Backcasting](https://polityfutures.substack.com/p/imagine-2040-building-the-future)_ outlines a forward-thinking approach to
shaping Europe’s future by considering multiple potential scenarios—ranging from inclusive
prosperity to competitive fragmentation and reactive adaptation. The article uses backcasting
as a strategic tool to outline the necessary steps and milestones, emphasising the importance of
adapting to global megatrends and the need for innovative experimentation and inclusive
policymaking to navigate evolving challenges effectively. The following recommendations
emerge from this exploration.


**Policy Recommendations**


  - **Providing meaningful citizen inclusion:** Policies should foster co-creation by actively
engaging citizens in decision-making processes. To achieve this, it is essential to
improve policy accessibility through more understandable and accessible
communication and by expanding opportunities for public engagement.


  - **Granting opportunities for risk-minimised experimentation:** Establish mechanisms
to experiment with innovative policy approaches for alternative economic and social
systems. By implementing controlled experiments—similar to ‘regulatory
sandboxes’—we can identify effective models that address disruptive global trends, and
subsequently scale these models while minimising societal risk.


  - **Promoting agile policy frameworks without compromising on democratic**
**standards:** Develop adaptable policies that can respond rapidly to emerging challenges
and changing circumstances. It is important to balance rapid policy responses with the
need to uphold and continuously enhance democratic governance standards and
processes.


These recommendations aim to ensure that Europe's future is not only resilient and adaptive
but also inclusive and democratic.
