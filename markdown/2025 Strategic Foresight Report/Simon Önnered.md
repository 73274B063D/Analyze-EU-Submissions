**Abstract:** Megatrends are cross-sectional and lasting developments
creating grand challenges. This study investigates the interlinkages of 14
megatrends and their consequences using cross-impact and emerging
issues analyses. The results map out interlinkages and long-term
implications for Europe’s future, underscoring the importance of
involving broader perspectives in policy making to uncover wider issues.
This study contributes to defining grand challenges and connecting
futures studies with socio-technical transitions literature. Results discuss
the advent of eco-awareness as a megatrend, and it identifies five
emerging challenge areas. Further research is essential for a more
comprehensive understanding of these intersections.


**Keywords:** Grand challenges, emerging issues, megatrends,
anticipation, European Union.


**1 Introduction**


This study explores the complex interactions between megatrends and the
emergence of grand challenges. Megatrends are long-term and global
developments that have a cross-cutting impact on society (Kuosa & Stucki,


1


2021). Grand challenges on the other hand, are issues that become largescale or global problems (George et al., 2016). Megatrends can oftentimes
be found to be framed as grand challenges, such as changing demographics
and climate change (see e.g., Brown, 2021; Kuiper & Brady, 2023).
However, megatrends give rise to many challenges and even though grand
challenges appear to share a lot of characteristics with megatrends, they are
different concepts, with distinct differences in framing and connotations
(OECD, 2016). When considered in isolation, megatrends present a
challenge, seemingly grand, yet in combination more emerge. In scenario
development and policy making, a first task is to combine different trends
and potential disruptions to derive plausible scenarios and in doing so, a
selection of trends is chosen (Whyte, J., personal communication, 2024 June
25; Wiebe et al., 2018). In doing so, there is a risk that certain consequences
are omitted from consideration since marginalized trends are excluded from
the analysis and those which act as threat multipliers by exacerbating other
challenges (Bremberg, 2018).

Current goals, objectives, and policy aim at addressing current societal,
environmental, and technological challenges. It is therefore evident that
interventions to solve these challenges can risk exacerbating other issues or
creating new ones entirely (Ferraro et al., 2015). Therefore, in addressing
these, we must also have our eye on the horizon and beware the challenges
of the next century. The intention here is not to divert focus from current
challenges being addressed, but to enlighten these potential challenges so
that innovations tackling challenges of today avoid exacerbating future
challenges and to contribute to systemic resilience through anticipation
(Brown, 2021). Previous research often states the complexity of megatrends
interlinkages as fact, research holistically and systematically investigating
these relationships, however, is scarcer. The Joint Research Centre (2020)
focused on five megatrends' impact on the security climate, revealing
challenges such as increasing resource conflicts and climate change
displacements which shows the need to consider these interlinkages.
Marmier et al., (2022) applied a text-mining approach to explore the
interlinkages within the megatrend of accelerating technological change
and hyperconnectivity, the authors propose that similar approaches can be
applied to assess the interlinkages between different megatrends rather than


2


just within. Lichtenthaler (2021) takes a conceptual approach to delve into
the positive and negative interdependencies between two megatrends,
sustainability and digitalization, showing how they share both positive and
negative effects on one another. It is worth noting, however, that Crossimpact analyses on trends provide ample basis for scenario development
(Alizadeh et al., 2016; Weimer-Jehle, 2005). As such, there may be a
plethora of literature to be uncovered hidden in scenario reports.
Nonetheless, since grand challenges and megatrends are complex and
highly interconnected, they require prospective theorizing to support
anticipatory policymaking (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1993; Gümüsay et al.,
2022; Marmier et al., 2022). Therefore, this study combines a systems- and
futures thinking approach, to treat them not in isolation but rather explore
their interconnectedness and how they can give rise to the emerging grand
issues of the next century (OECD, 2016). Our focus and frame of reference
is guided by our broad disciplines of innovation, design, and technology;
wherein we combine our perspectives and disciplines using design-,
resilience-, futures-, and analytical thinking (Bühring & Liedtka, 2018).


**The problem, purpose, and question**


Foresight in EU policymaking serves the purpose of prioritising issues,
future proofing policy, and anticipating future challenges (Van Woensel,
2024). Understanding the complexity of trend interlinkages, however, is a
long-term challenge for policy design (Panula-Ontto et al., 2018). Whilst
the policies of today attempt to resolve contemporary issues, they risk
exacerbating the problems of tomorrow. It is therefore important to
anticipate and monitor these developments and their potential for emerging
issues. The purpose of this study is to shed light onto these complexities and
their potential challenges to contribute to anticipatory policymaking.
Answering the research question: _What are the interlinkages of megatrends_
_and their potential consequences?_ The scope of this inquiry is the European
Union (EU) as a meso-level of analysis and time horizon of around 2050.


**2 Literature review**


The following sections reviews literature on futures studies and foresight,
the multi-level perspective (MLP), and grand challenges.


**Futures studies and foresight**


Foresight research, generally, attempts to theorize when, where, how, and
why inquiries into the future work (Fergnani & Chermack, 2020). Whereas
futures studies constitute a systematic inquiry into the future (Dator, 2019).
As such, we view foresight as the process, and futures as the product of the
process (Öner, 2010). Consequently, there are many epistemological
underpinnings and assumptions that make such an inquiry possible, from a
positivistic reality which can be foreseen provided enough data or a
constructivist point of view as the future being something which resides in
the minds of people or aggregated to collectively held imaginaries
(Jasanoff, 2021; Piirainen & Gonzalez, 2015). As such, the field has largely
progressed from positivistic predictions (Kristóf, 2024). Ravetz et al.,
(2021) describe the evolution of foresight as moving from predictions to
identifying opportunities and understanding the non-linear dynamics and
multi-domain dependencies, towards a co-evolutionary understanding of
emergence, synergies, and collective inquiry (Ravetz et al., 2021). Whilst
we acknowledge that the future cannot be accurately predicted, we support
the idea of exploring trends, emerging issues and alternative futures to build
a better future (Minkkinen, 2020). In EU policymaking, foresight has
manifested itself and plays a crucial role through several institutions and
influenced policy design and decision-making through continuous horizon
scanning, scenario planning, and risk assessments amongst others (Van
Woensel, 2024).


**Multi-level perspective**


Grand societal challenges require transformative innovations (Geels, 2020),
to understand which, the author lays forth the MLP as a conceptual
framework for understanding the transitions thereof (Geels, 2019). In
combination with a futures perspective, the MLP provides a well

4


established framework for navigating the complex dynamics of change and
the different ways in which the socio-technical regime may reconfigure
through different horizons of change (Vähäkari et al, 2020).

The MLP describes three levels of change, see Figure 1. The niche ( _micro_ )
level describes the weak signals of change, including developing
technologies, products, and movements in protected spaces. The _meso_ -level
encompasses the multiple domains of the system in question, herein the EU.
It is comprised of dominant technology, culture, science, markets, users and
preferences, industry, and policy. Above the regime resides the _macro_ -level
landscape developments which are the dominant forces shaping societies
(i.e., megatrends) on a global level in addition to shorter term shocks such
as pandemics and wars (Geels, 2019; Vähäkari et al., 2020). The MLP
depicts the transition of the regime from the current dominant system,
towards a more fit for context future system and the more turbulent
transitory phase of H2 in between, much akin to the three horizons
framework (Sharpe et al., 2016).


**Figure 1.** Multi-level Perspective, adapted from Systems Innovation Network (n.d.)
and Geels (2004). Light grey arrows indicate grand challenges and H1-3 represents

different horizons of change (Sharpe et al., 2016).

Megatrends are part of the external environment to the meso-level regime.
They exert pressure onto the socio-technical regime allowing emerging


niches to enter and get a footing in the system (Geels, 2004). Niches may
present both threats and opportunities and they are difficult to spot and
project as they have yet to come to fruition (Dator, 2018). Megatrends are
the result of a range of drivers which are grouped and framed to support
high-level policy discussions on current and emerging challenges
(Wilkinson, 2016). They are largely uncontrollable, have cross-sectoral
impact and last anywhere around 10-30 years (van Dorsser & Taneja, 2020).
Since these megatrends are the aggregation of underlying drivers, they can
be framed ambiguously as evident by the vast repository of online
megatrend reports providing different but related accounts of megatrends.
For the purposes of this paper, we draw from the European Commission’s
(2022) knowledge for policy platform, the Megatrends hub. The hub
contains a set of 14 megatrends and a description of underlying trends which
are relevant for the future of Europe. The megatrends are all built on a
rigorous process of research and deliberation to support EU policymaking
process. Since its conception, is has been periodically kept up to date and
relies on continuous contributions as a form of collective intelligence
(European Commission, 2019).

In Molitor’s model of change (2010), the first step of the emergence of an
issue is the external environment (i.e., landscape). Molitor considers more
aspects of the socio-technical regime as part of the environment, however,
the general idea aligns, since it includes aspects such as wars and
megatrends. Stemming from developments in this environment, issues
emerge which can be framed. This is a creative process as problems go from
ill-defined and abstract to more specified and defined ( _ibid_ ). Axelsson
(2022) suggests that once an emergent phenomenon has been identified,
understanding whether it is a good or bad and for whom is necessary. Ideas
may die at their infancy, whilst more sound ideas emerge and do so over
longer time spans.

Integrating the concepts above, using the MLP as a theoretical framework,
we outline our conceptualization and definition of what constitutes a grand
challenge and the emergence thereof, also separating the concept from that
of megatrends. In doing so, we deal with the issues of degrees of
complexity, issues of scale, and temporal scope which otherwise can create


6


a broad and non-specific concept (Seelos, Mair, & Traeger, 2023).
Megatrends are impactful, large-scale, and long-lasting developments,
whereas grand challenges are the consequences of such trends. Grand
challenges are thereby defined as the pressures exerted upon the regime
from landscape developments. They can come in the form of shocks or
stresses and are pervasive, as in their effects are largely homogeneously felt
throughout the system. This imposes a stronger distinction between
megatrends and challenges as it is the effects of such events and trends that
impose challenges rather than the trends themselves. Global or grand
challenges from another perspective constitute not only problems to
address, but also scientific, technological, ecological, and social goals or
ambitions which can unlock new abilities for the progression of human and
planetary development (Kaldewey, 2018). We view such challenges as the
development and integration of niches into the regime, i.e., the bottom-up
societal advancements as shown in figure 1. As such, we can thereby view
grand challenges as existing on a spectrum of intricacy, from complicated
to complex, between the simple and wicked (Martí, 2018). This view then
includes scientific advances as more complicated grand challenges concern
the development of niches and them breaking into the regime, they are nonpersistent and of relative scale to the system in question. Whereas the more
complex problems stem from the pressure exerted upon the system from the
landscape (Brown, 2021). Grand challenges in the form of achievements,
such as major advancements in technology, medicine, or mathematics, still
constitute a grand challenge however of a simpler complexity.


**Challenges of the 21st century**


The challenges faced by the EU during this century are many and cannot
possibly be fully covered in neither depth nor breadth. However, this section
attempts to provide an overview of recent accounts thereto as a baseline
depiction of what is anticipated. Kuiper & Brady (2023) focusing on health
within the EU discuss _challenges_ (not referring to them as grand but treated
in an equivalent manner). They mention several megatrends as challenges
and acknowledge their interconnectedness, including but not limited to the
Russian aggression on Ukraine, the cost-of-living crisis, changing
demographics and climate change. Framed as global, grand, and thorny


challenges, Brown (2021) outline two challenges: The first concerns multicrises in already vulnerable communities that inhibits their core
functionality, the challenge therein is for their governments to provide
security during prolonged and multiple crises. The second is the widening
inequalities on multiple scales from global to local, in how power,
resources, and emissions are distributed. Drawing from more popular
literature, we find extensive lists of grand challenges for the future of the
21st century. Lufkin (2017a; 2017b) outline many challenges for the BBC:s
future column, beginning with the ethics of genetic modification; dealing
with an ageing population; sinking cities and their populations; the spread
of social media and its effects on society; global security as new geopolitical
tensions rise; transitioning to driverless vehicles; resource scarcity;
interplanetary travel and colonization; neural enhancements and their effect
on inequality; and the rising concern over AI’s influence. These grand
challenges are however both scientific advancements and problems to
manage, for a more extensive list, see Lufkin (2017b).

More rigorous sources of grand challenges on the other hand can be drawn
from The Millennium Project (2024), a private think tank which provides a
framework for 15 global challenges which are continuously monitored and
updated using a vast repository of expert knowledge (Glenn & Gordon,
2001). Published around the turn of the century 15 global issues and
opportunities were merged into 15 global challenges standing before us at
the time, along with a normative scenario on the 2050 horizon ( _ibid_ ). By
merging issues and opportunities, The Millenium Project frames each
challenge as a question of how, and thereby manages to combine the
problems perspective and societal-scientific advancement perspective.
These global challenges include a comprehensive range of areas: Achieving
sustainable development for all, ensuring sufficient clean water without
conflict, balancing population growth and resources, creating genuine
democracy from authoritarian regimes, and making policy decisions
sensitive to long-term and global issues. Additional challenges include
ensuring information and communications technologies work for the
benefit of everyone, promoting ethical market economies to reduce wealth
disparities, combating new and reemerging diseases, enhancing decisionmaking capacities amidst changing work and institutional landscapes, and


8


developing new security strategies to curb ethnic conflicts and terrorism.
Furthermore, they address improving the status of women to better the
human condition, preventing organized crime from gaining more power,
meeting growing energy demands safely and efficiently, accelerating
scientific and technological advancements for societal benefit, and
incorporating ethical considerations into global decision-making processes
(Glenn & Gordon, 2001). Finally, these challenges are accompanied by
suggested actions to address said challenges as well as regional
considerations taking into account the more nuanced contexts around the
world (See, The Millennium Project, 2024). These challenges represent
long-lasting challenges which have been around for a long time and will
continue to for the foreseeable future.


**3 Methodology**


Conventional trend analysis focuses on one trend in isolation (Puglisi,
2001). As megatrends are characterized by an ambiguous and
interconnected nature (Marmier et al., 2022), we explore them in relation to
one another through a cross-impact analysis (Weimer-Jehle, 2005). Crossimpact analysis was initially developed by Theodore Gordon and Olaf
Helmer in 1966 to assess the probability of an event occurring and the
impact this had on other events occurring (Gordon, 1994; Helmer, 1977).
From which different policy interventions could be introduced and analysed
to assess their impact on this probability or consequence of the event
(Gordon, 1994). Focusing on the consequences of the combined
developments of megatrends, this study analyses the impact of megatrends
on each other in terms of events or forces that could be a consequence of
their interaction, described in more detail in the following sections. This
analysis is then followed by an emerging issues analysis, developed in the
70s by Graham Molitor to forecast changes in public-policy, EIA has
reached extensive use as a futures method (Dator, 2018; Molitor, 2018). In
combination these two methods contribute to the purpose of exploring the
complex interlinkages of megatrends and anticipating their conceived
challenges. Figure 2 shows an overview of the research design and flow


between the input, analysis and outputs including the number of items
processed in each stage.


**Figure 2** . Overview of research design.


**Cross-impact analysis**


To understand the interlinkages between megatrends, this study employs a
cross-impact analysis using soft-system knowledge and intuitive logics
(Weimer-Jehle, 2005). The method has seen extensive use as a futures
methodology, e.g., Panula-Ontto et al. (2018) applied the method for the
purpose of identifying emerging challenges in the Finnish energy system.
As megatrends can by definition be assumed to affect each other, this study
takes a more qualitative approach to assessing their impact on one another
rather than assessing the severity thereof. Drawing from the 14 megatrends
as outlined by the European Commission’s (2022) Megatrends hub,
interlinkages between trends were assessed in terms of driving forces and
potential consequences. The interlinkages of the megatrends were
systematically reviewed, totalling 182 potential combinations which were
surveyed and discussed amongst the three researchers. For each possible
link we asked what impact Y on a global level had on X in the EU by 2050
and if this posed a significant challenge beyond the trend itself based on the
combined expertise of the authors. The matrix found in the appendix was
tagged with a +, -, ±, or ‘?’ depending on the directionality and uncertainty
of the impact. The causal reasoning was based on trend cards procured
through the Megatrends hub which included a description and underlying
trends, combined with complementary expertise and backgrounds (van


10


Woensel, 2024). Certain assumptions are imposed regarding the
megatrends reach in time, space, and impact, all assumed to be
comparatively equal and constant. Considering that these megatrends are
based on the same dataset and are rigorously framed, we can consider them
to operate within the same scope (van Dorsser & Taneja, 2020). Regarding
any perceived uncertainties, the impact would be tabled for further research
and consideration, meaning that a brief literature review was conducted, and
the impact was discussed again at a later stage as the matrix was reassessed.
Through this iterative and systematic assessment, previous assumptions
could also be questioned, allowing for new insights to emerge and allowing
for a second chance to identify any previously missed impacts. This process
resulted in 127 impacts, 15 of which were identified as potential challenges
to be analysed further and framed as part of the Emerging Issues Analysis
(EIA). The novelty of challenges that emerged as a result of this analysis
varied. Some were more prevalent such as the ensuing climate crisis, others
less apparent such as generational inequality.


**Emerging issues analysis**


An EIA is used to understand potential threats and opportunities in their
early stages of emergence (Dator, 2018; Inayatullah, 2008). This allows for
monitoring developments in anticipation of them and provide early
warnings (Wildman, 2001). Typically, emerging issues are detected through
bottom-up scanning, searching for weak signals which may pose issues as
they grow to become trends or even megatrends (Schultz, 2006). However,
defining challenges as the pressures exerted on the European regime from
megatrends, challenges were identified based on the combined impact of
two megatrends. Thereby, rather than assessing the impact of niche
technologies, social movements, or policies, this approach uncovers
challenges stemming from a more aggregate level.


The model as shown in
figure 3 describes three
phases of development as an
issue goes from
developments in the external
environment, to be (I)
identified and framed, (II)
advanced into consideration,
and (III) finally into
resolution. The method was
employed to assess the
emergence of each of the
identified potential
challenges, navigating the
space between the external
environment and the ideas
which emerge to frame them.
This process relied heavily on

judgement (Helmer, 1977).
Challenges were thereby selected based on perceived novelty by screening
traditional and grey literature, including policy documents and for their
mention. Issues high on the model of change i.e., phases II or III were
excluded from further assessment. Taking a step back and viewing the
bigger picture of impacts, the challenges were grouped based on emergent
themes that were further developed through literature review and are
presented as such in the following results section.

For validation of the approach and findings, we utilized an extended peer
community (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1993). Utilizing internal review
functions, conference presentation and discussion to elicit feedback, and
disseminated and discussed the findings with the Joint Research Centre of
the European Commission (Whyte, J., personal communication, 2024 June
25).

**4 Results**


This section presents a description of the emerging challenge areas, the
underlying cross-impact matrix can be found in the appendix showing
ideated impacts. While megatrends can largely be assumed to affect each
other, these impacts are based on our combined expertise and ability to
identify potential challenges. This means that this framing is not
unambiguous nor exhaustive. Where there is a connection missing, it is due
to us not being able to reason out a significant impact and not due it not
potentially existing one.


**Emerging grand challenges**


The following are the identified and framed challenges as interpreted and
further developed through literature review, backing up the interlinkages
and exploring their possible development.


_Generational inequality and retirement crisis_


Widening inequality and demographical change drive each other in a
potentially vicious circle. Demographical change imposes greater inequality
between generations, and widening inequality increase already prevalent
gaps between generations. Weighing in new forms of work such as the gig
economy these developments are rendering workers future retirement at
stake as fewer contribute to their pension savings potentially leading to a
pension crisis, as pension and welfare systems are not able to cover this gap
if gig economies continue to grow (Allchin, 2024; Swedish Pension
Agency, 2021). Meanwhile growing fears that pension systems resemble
Ponzi schemes as they rely on continual growth and throughout of a
productive population threaten the integrity and legitimacy of such systems.
In the wake of increasing relative voting power amongst the elderly,
potential reform may be increasingly difficult as short- and long-term
interests become unaligned.


_Climate crisis, migration, and resource scarcity._


The effects of continued climate degradation, growing resource scarcity,
and resulting climate refugees will constitute a grand challenge. It is of the
outmost interest to avoid such a crisis in the first place (Noonan & Rusu,
2022). However, with current global policies, the possibility of limiting
warming to even 2°C is looking grim (IPCC, 2023). Besides physical
resources such as food, water, energy, and land, as megatrends are
progressing and reinforcing each other, time is yet another resource
becoming scarce as complexity and urgency are perpetually increasing.
With more exposed nations increasingly looking towards the ‘developed’
world for remedy and compensation, a future with increasing climate
refugees will place an immense burden and strain on European systems. It


14


will become increasingly pressing to find levels of sufficiency which lead
to stable populations and systems to support them, with adequate levels of
consumption which ensures levels of quality of life without inflicting upon
planetary boundaries (Jungell-Michelsson & Heikkurinen, 2022).


_Urban systems under pressure_


Continuing urbanization and climate change and environmental degradation
is putting pressure on an already strained resource scarcity (He et al., 2021).
This problem can already be seen manifesting in megacities such as Mexico
City, especially with the development of informal settlements where access
to water and waste management is a growing challenge (Gutierrez, 2019).
Such settlements are scarcer in high income areas such as the EU, however,
without affordable and adequate housing, a rise in such housing may be on
the horizon for European countries (Kuffer, Proietti, & Siragusa, 2023).
More prevalent infrastructure congestion can be seen in electricity systems
around Europe, with a projected need to double cross-border transmission
infrastructure by 2030 (European Commission, 2023). Although this is both
a supply and demand issue, changing weather patterns will continue to
exacerbate these strains by crippling power production capacity, reducing
transmission capacity through overheating, and increasing power demand
through heating and cooling. Under normal operation this is oftentimes
manageable, however, during peak demand, issues become more apparent
(Sherman, Lin, & McElroy, 2022). These developments will come to affect
infrastructure such as fresh- and wastewater, transportation, and energy, in
the long-term causing outages, congestion, and other systemic issues.
Therefore, we see a growing demand to flattening daily consumption curves
through both technological and social means, in addition to conventional
infrastructure development. However, changing behaviour and daily
consumption patterns imposes a grand challenge of redesigning practises
and society. Using the theory of social practice, Smale, van Vliet and
Spaargaren (2017) analyse the barriers and opportunities to sustainable
domestic energy consumption by looking at the interaction between
household practices and smart grids. The process of realising smart grid
interventions can conflict with existing daily routines as it requires a
fundamental shift in how and when resources are consumed. Such a change


imposes a readjustment and flexibility in daily routines and behaviour.
While some practices are easier to stretch and reconfigure, other practices
such as cooking, can pose obstacles, causing further social injustices.
Technological advancements and growth of certain sectors is poised to
mitigate this challenge by increasing efficiency, scaling up systems to create
more headroom, and eliminating bottlenecks. However, in doing so most
likely also creating induced demand through rebound effects and therefore
also requires behavioural change (Giampetro & Mayumi, 2018).


_Detachment from reality_


Following technological advancements, a changing security paradigm,
increasing influence of new governing systems – The challenge of
distinguishing between real and fake news, and between the physical,
virtual, and augmented realities, will most likely continue to grow, which
in turn feeds into misinformation, insecurity, and distrust posing further
threats to democracy (Vaccari & Chadwick, 2020). Perceptions of reality
will grow increasingly subjective and multiple as there will be trustworthy
experiences that become personal truths (Suiter, 2016). Competing
narratives of techno-utopic and dystopic visions of society as new
technologies constitute both threats and opportunities. Potentially parallel
societies in the digital realm, building on already existing isolation,
depression, and loneliness, creating a social detachment from reality; and
others seeking to disconnect from hyperconnectivity altogether. Further
social lock-in is created through algorithmic filter bubbles which limits
ones’ worldview (Maati et al. 2023). New laws are coming into place that
mandate that artificially generated photos and films of people be branded as
such, however, this does not stop bad actors from disregarding such rules.
Early-stage examples of this can already be witnessed to an extent through
misinformation campaigns (Government Offices of Sweden, 2023),
growing corruption (Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs,
2023), and direct sabotage leading to conspiracy theories as there may be
distrust behind official truths (Guhl, 2024). However, these are possibly
merely early signals of a much greater challenge in the long-term. Future
challenges in this cohort of issues include validating the source or truth of
material, which will be an immense technical and social challenge. There is


16


a possibility that this challenge can be mitigated by a diversification of
education and learning, making younger generations better able to suss out
misinformation and artificially generated content; and older generations to
acquire this ability further down the road. Some technological
advancements may also subdue this risk by being able to flag artificially
generated content and potentially misleading information, however, this
creates a perpetual arms race between those trying to influence and those
trying to detect.


_Labor displacement_


A stagnating European population growth, a booming population in
developing economies, increasing adversities from climate change and a
desperate need for a skilled workforce. These developments present an
immense ethical challenge, characterized by a disparity between climate
contra skill migration. Countries are shutting down their borders to refugees
whilst calling for a skilled workforce to help abate their growing pension
and productivity crisis, yet migrants are oftentimes de-skilled and exploited
to work low-paying and low-skilled jobs (Purkayastha et al., 2023). We see
a future, where migrant populations are forced to, or otherwise required to
upskill themselves using their own educational infrastructure or one
imposed on them from the developed world, in order to have the chance of
receiving a working permit. Much akin to the older concept of brain drain,
the phenomena of emigrating skilled labour seeking opportunities
elsewhere, whereas this (re)emerging form of more exploitative nature.
Competition for qualified students has been a long-standing trend in higher
education (Bennell & Pearce, 2003). National higher education in
developing countries has suffered at the hand of private and overseas
institutions that are able to attract top candidates (ibid) and may continue to
do so. Shaping educational policy in developing countries according to the
needs and wants of the developed world imposes significant cultural clashes
and questionable sustainability at both ends of the equation, becoming a
form of colonization of education (See also Silova, Rappleye, & Auld,
2020). Overcoming these multifaceted issues in a sustainable, just, and
ethical way reveals a significant grand challenge of the future significant
change in systems of education, migration, and labour around the world.


Although this may to an extent be mitigated by diversification of education
and learning, allowing people to reskill to suit changing needs, it does not
address the larger challenge of labour scarcity. Whilst technological
improvements and automation may subvert some demand, future concern
for physical labour are still prevalent. In a recent policy briefing by the
OECD (2023) they describe how the EU energy transition will generate 2.5
million jobs and the importance of migration to that end. Since potential
migrants might not possess the adequate skillset, it is proposed that this be
matched with development modules in the origin countries. Concurrently,
emerging fears of white-collar work being displaced as a consequence of
increasing technological advancements such as artificial intelligence
introduces further uncertainties of the future, potentially serving as a
remedy or further exacerbating these challenges.


**5 Discussion and concluding remarks**


This study contributes to the understanding of interlinkages between
megatrends, providing a holistic outlook on emerging grand challenges
2050 and beyond that should be continuously counteracted. In doing so, we
emphasise the importance of considering the breadth of developments as
they can strengthen the consequence of others and create otherwise
unanticipated consequences (Bremberg, 2018). Going beyond the global
challenges of previously published literature, these emerging grand
challenges contribute to the continued outlook for anticipatory governance.
As opposed to the global challenges of The Millenium Project as described
by Glenn & Gordon (2001), we propose a distinction between grand
challenges of a scientific and advancement nature to that of a more complex
challenge. In doing so, this study also contributes to the integration of
futures studies with the Multi-level Perspective (see also, Vähäkari et al.,
2020).

Lastly, we propose that sustainability/eco-awareness become a megatrend
as a fifteenth megatrend in the Competence Centre on Foresight as it would
serve to balance the impacts of several trends, acting as a ‘threat divider’.
However, in doing so we must not assume that sustainability is an


18


unstoppable force, more effort is needed to accelerate this trend and thereby
ease the burden on the others. The trend of eco-awareness or sustainability
in general, is sometimes viewed as a megatrend (see e.g., Mittelstaedt et al.,
2014), however, not in the Megatrends hub. It is however mentioned as part
of the growing consumption megatrend that more eco-conscious
consumption is increasing, this does not align with the overall megatrend
nor covers the additional effects of evo-awareness. Furthermore, it is
stipulated in megatrend (5) that the effects of climate change are affecting
behaviour. Though this may be explained as climate change and
environmental degradation impacting the cultural and preferential nature of
the socio-technical regime, broad cultural changes may also constitute
landscape developments (Geels, 2004). Therefore, we argue that this has
developed steadily enough to necessitate it as a stand-alone megatrend and
is required to fill some missing links in the mapping process. For instance,
eco-awareness is contributing to peoples’ reproductive choices thereby
increasing demographic imbalances (Dillarstone, Brown, & Flores, 2023);
and climate change and environmental degradation should have an indirect
negative effect on growing consumption through a megatrend of ecoawareness. There is also a missing link here between how climate change
and degradation affect consumption patterns from fossil-fuels towards other
resources changing the influence of e.g., oil states.


**Limitations and future(s) research**


Due to our holistic perspective, we miss out on the depth of analysis within
each development and the challenges. Therefore, further research can
choose to focus on particular relationships and their potential consequences,
however, with the remainder thereof still in consideration. Furthermore, as
we deal with these issues on a systemic level, certain more niche challenges
are overlooked, whose implications can be of great significance in the longterm. Therefore, a more bottom-up perspective of investigating the
emerging grand challenges stemming from the development of niche
innovations is warranted.

There are several methodological limitations to this research. First and
foremost, our outlook of challenges is non exhaustive and is subject to our


areas of expertise and biases as it served to explore and exemplify the
complexity of interlinkages. Therefore, further research and practise should
take similar approaches utilizing wider range of expertise and perspectives.
Secondly, future research can consider different weights of linkages through
expert judgement. Lastly, the pace at which these megatrends develop has
not taken into account and can differentiate greatly between trends. We use
some form of presumption regarding their coevolution which therefore also
can be more quantitatively compared. Although the relationships between
these trends are multiple, they may also be changing (De Smedt, Borch, &
Fuller, 2011). Therefore, there is room for additional uncertainty as their
relationships may transform in the future.

Pertaining the discussed challenges, further research can establish
indicators to monitor their development to see whether they emerge on the
agenda. More work can also go into framing and understanding the
problems per se. Due to the uncertainty given this time scope, establishing
indicators to track the emergence of these challenges can give a continuous
indication of their accuracy and the efficacy of means to address them. This
paper does not predict what will happen, however, implores the reader to
beware and anticipate them as potential developments. To assess their
progression in policy, text mining approaches can be utilized in policy
discourse and reports. (Marmier et al., 2022).
