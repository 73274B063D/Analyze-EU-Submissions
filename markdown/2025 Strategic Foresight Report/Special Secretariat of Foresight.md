feedback: One of the most significant crises that Europe will have to face in the
  coming years is the aging of the population in its member states. The European Union's
  demographic problem is characterized by the gradual aging of its population, as
  reflected in a series of statistical indicators. One of the most critical factors
  is the increase in the proportion of elderly people, with 21% of the population
  aged 65 and over in 2020, compared to 16% in 2001. Even more striking is the rise
  in the population group aged 80 and over, whose percentage nearly doubled from 3.4%
  in 2001 to 6% in 2020. At the same time, the proportion of young people under the
  age of 20 has declined, dropping from 23% in 2001 to 20% in 2020, indicating low
  birth rates and potential future challenges for economic growth and the sustainability
  of pension and social security systems. This demographic trend is observed across
  all member states, with countries such as Italy, Greece, and Germany having the
  highest proportions of elderly people, while Ireland and Luxembourg have the lowest.
  The consequences of aging include increased pressure on public finances, the need
  to restructure labor markets, and reforms in health and welfare policies to ensure
  intergenerational balance and the long-term sustainability of European societies.
  Additionally, there should be a reassessment of social benefits, particularly in
  terms of infrastructure and services for the elderly, in relation to those provided
  for newborns and children. Of course, this is just one of the many challenges the
  EU will have to address in the coming years. In order to make better-informed decisions
  regarding fiscal policy, I believe that Fiscal Foresight should be adopted. A network
  should be developed where policymakers responsible for shaping fiscal policies both
  at the EU level and within member states can receive insights from research institutions
  and universities. Furthermore, citizen participation should be encouraged to help
  determine the prioritization of different policy areas.
