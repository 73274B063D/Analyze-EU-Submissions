feedback: 'TES is a global green energy company focused on developing giga-scale projects
  to produce hydrogen-based e-fuels, such as e-NG (electric natural gas made from
  green hydrogen and CO2). Based in Europe and operating worldwide, TES uses renewable
  power combined with climate-neutral CO2 to create e-NG, a drop-in fuel that can
  replace fossil natural gas exactly like biomethane. This scalable and cost-effective
  approach aims to provide reliable and affordable green energy globally by building
  on existing infrastructure and processes. TES seeks to accelerate the adoption of
  green molecules across various sectors by making them easy to transport and consumeto
  deliver on real zero targets and win the climate race. We welcome the public consultation
  of the upcoming strategic foresight report, and in particular its focus on resilience,
  inter alia of the energy system. To reach this goal, a variety of increasingly renewable
  sources of energy will be required moving forward. Beside ensuring that a variety
  of technologies can be supported, it will also be key to guarantee that the EU can
  continue to rely on safe and secure import of renewable energy sources, while quickly
  scaling up its own internal production capacity and internal market for renewable
  energy sources. To this end, a focus on the below would be recommended in our view:
  1. Remaining committed to our existing EU targets while defining ambitious milestones
  towards 2035, 2040, 2045, 2050 and beyond. There is no way back. It is crucial to
  reconcile competitiveness with decarbonisation targets and ensure that they are
  both achievable and sustainable. To this end, the EU should continue pushing for
  high renewable and low-carbon targets across Member States and build on new and
  existing initiatives (eg the COP, IEA Clean Energy Ministerial) while putting forward
  policy tools such as renewable gas blending mandates successfully featured in Canada,
  Japan or France, to mention a few; 2. Ensuring adequate financing, simple funding
  rules, and financing tools, are put in place to achieve our objectives will be fundamental.
  An assessment of the available funding at EU and Member States level, along with
  a forecast to be included in the upcoming MFF negotiations should be incorporated
  to ensure that funding channels are sustainable and realistic o The proposal of
  an industrial decarbonisation bank to channel funding (whether ETS-based or other)
  into the most cost-effective decarbonisation option for different end-user sector
  should be supported and quickly implemented as low-hanging fruits to reducing our
  emissions; other schemes should be simplified and/or integrated to simplify the
  landscape o Renewable-focused funding should be clearly earmarked maintained, to
  ensure that our long-term objective remains clear and locks-in our energy system
  into the most sustainable pathway in terms of resources; o Technology neutrality
  must rule, with an objective lifecycle assessment methodology to gauge on the emission
  reduction benefits 3. Implementation of existing EU legislation, targets and rules
  is paramount to ensuring the resilience of the EU and a level-playing field across
  Member States. The example of the Renewable Energy Directive (2023/2413) and its
  ability to unlock business cases when properly implemented across the EU along with
  its targets and facilitating internal market tools (such as the Union Database)
  is a case in point. TES believes that by (1) ensuring regulatory certainty and stability
  through accelerated and full implementation of EU legislation and targets across
  Member States (2) earmarking sufficient financing for decarbonisation objectives
  that can ensure security of supply and resilience and making it simple to access
  and (3) ensuring that clear and ambitious targets and milestones are set-out towards
  2035, 2040, 2045, 2050 and beyond, the EU will be able to decisively reconcile increased
  competitiveness and resilience.'
