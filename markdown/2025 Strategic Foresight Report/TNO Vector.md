feedback: 'The concept of control points is crucial when considering resilience. Control
  points are high-value, unique business activities (or networks of activities) that
  create strong dependencies towards public and/or private actors. Building up control
  points provides both a measure of security and a negotiation position, mitigating
  against future (economic or geopolitical) shocks. Although the concept of control
  points is gaining traction, descriptions of control points are remaining mostly
  anecdotal. TNO Vector is working on a systematic study of control points, exploring
  how control points can be measured, aiming to understand success factors of establishing
  control points and proposing metrics to measure progress towards securing control
  points. The first part of this study is publicly available (https://vector.tno.nl/artikelen/grip-control-points-gerichter-innoveren/).
  Here we describe control points from three perspectives: the individual company,
  network and geopolitical perspectives, with initial criteria for the control point
  in each. Although this study takes the Dutch perspective, the insights are translatable
  to a European level. Follow-up studies are in train to identify current and potential
  control points, both within the Netherlands and internationally. These studies are
  expected to provide actionable insights towards current or future control points;
  and towards mitigating or circumventing control points of others. Insights from
  these studies can be shared in confidence to inform the Strategic Foresight Report.'

llm_agreements: Both submissions prioritise strengthening EU resilience by identifying
  and securing critical dependencies in technology and supply chains, and both advocate
  using systematic, evidence-based approaches (metrics, mapping, and studies) to inform
  policy. Each supports actionable inputs to the Strategic Foresight Report and the
  use of analysis that translates into operational policy levers across company, network
  and geopolitical scales.
llm_disagreements: 'The two differ in emphasis and normative framing: one stresses
  democratic safeguards, public-funded and precautionary research, intergenerational
  fairness, ethics and enforcement of rights-facing regulation, while the other focuses
  on a business-centric concept of building and measuring ''control points'' to secure
  negotiating positions and strategic advantage. This creates potential tension between
  promoting private or corporate control points as security levers and prioritising
  public oversight, transparency and limits on private capture.'
