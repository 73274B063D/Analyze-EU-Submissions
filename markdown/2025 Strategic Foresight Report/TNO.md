feedback: We imagine a future in 2040 where EU industry holds defensible positions
  in many major value chains, supported by a highly skilled workforce, a high-quality
  research, development and innovation (RD&I) ecosystem, and integrated European innovation
  investment and policy. Polarization in society is reduced, not only by accepting
  grassroots input into policymaking but also by installing policies aimed at improving
  quality of life and reducing inequalities. Achieving this requires overcoming our
  current challenges (such as over-reliance on non-EU states for energy and materials,
  slow governance, lack of focus in innovation funding) and leveraging our key strengths
  (such as our strong R&I ecosystem, regulatory leadership, a large single market).
  Key policy lines include building up a high-tech industry through sustained support
  for RD&I. A long-term vision, combined with constant monitoring of progress and
  the courage to discontinue underperforming initiatives will foster confidence and
  unlock investment. However, the interplay between various priorities presents both
  synergies and tensions. For instance, there is tension between protecting industry
  and supporting free trade; conversely growing wellbeing and restoring natural capital
  are mutually supportive. Fully understanding these dynamics requires considering
  higher-order impacts, delayed feedback loops, and the inherent unpredictability
  of human behaviour. The complexity of these interrelationships necessitates a comprehensive
  approach to strategic foresight. Strategic foresight could be enhanced by combining
  foresight with System Dynamics to capture the complex feedback loops within the
  strategic foresight work. This can be achieved through several approaches. One approach
  is to develop future scenarios and then create a System Dynamics model from scratch
  representing the scenarios, effectively modelling the system of the future. Another
  approach is to create a model of the current system while developing future scenarios
  in parallel and then exploring how the system behaves in each scenario, thus modelling
  the future of the system. A third approach is to create a both a model of the current
  system and the ideal future, and then backcasting from the future into the current
  system, modelling how the current system enables or prevents change. TNO has piloted
  an approach to combine System Dynamics and foresight, using Arctic melting as a
  use case. This pilot provides valuable insights and a collaborative methodology
  that can be adapted and applied to other areas. The integration of System Dynamics
  and foresight offers a robust framework for understanding and navigating the complexities
  of strategic planning and policymaking in the EU.

# Call for Evidence for the 2025 Strategic Foresight Report

TNO supports the Commission’s continued commitment to foresight and the focus on
resilience, especially considering the recent fast and drastic changes in geopolitics. We
welcome the opportunity to contribute to the 2025 Strategic Foresight Report through this Call
for Evidence and stand ready to provide further clarification or elaboration, if required.
## Scope

Strengthening Europe's resilience, competitiveness, and strategic autonomy starts with a candid
assessment of current weaknesses to address and strengths to build on. We note the following:


_Challenges_

  - **Overreliance on non-European partners** for energy, raw materials, and defence
increases supply chain risks and weakens strategic autonomy. Recent geopolitical
events highlight the urgency of diversification and domestic capacity building.

  - **Complicated and slow governance** limits Europe’s ability to respond swiftly to
emerging challenges. Bureaucratic inefficiencies and complex decision-making
processes hinder progress in key sectors.

  - **Lack of available capital for innovation deployment** slows commercialization and
scale-up of deep-tech industries. European startups face significant barriers in securing
growth funding compared to global competitors.

  - **Fragmented investment efforts** dilute impact. A more strategic, coordinated approach
is needed to maximize returns and strengthen leadership in key technologies.

  - **Overemphasis on GDP as a success metric** risks sidelining broader objectives like
sustainability, resilience, and social well-being. Policy frameworks should incorporate
more holistic indicators of progress.

_Strengths_

  - **Strong R&I ecosystem** supports world-class research and innovation, with potential for
greater commercialization if funding gaps are addressed.

  - **European values promote broader success metrics** beyond GDP, aligning with global
trends in sustainability and responsible innovation.

  - **Largest single market** enables economies of scale, cross-border trade, and a
harmonized regulatory environment, making Europe attractive for investment.

  - **Regulatory leadership** in areas like data protection and sustainable finance positions
the EU as a global standard-setter.

  - **Stable political climate** reduces investment risks, offering predictability in an
increasingly uncertain global landscape.

## Imagine 2040

We described below how we would characterise a resilient EU in 2040


By 2040, the European Union has established itself as a **global leader in key industrial and**
**technological sectors**, securing economic control points – high-value, high-barrier nodes
within global supply chains – across many major value chains.


The cornerstone of this industrial resilience is a highly skilled workforce, supported by a worldclass **research, development, and innovation (RD&I) ecosystem** . By investing in specialized


education and training programs, the EU ensures that its labour market remains competitive in
the face of rapid technological change.


Europe in 2040 measures **prosperity** through a broader lens, incorporating health and wellbeing, environmental sustainability, and social cohesion. Investment and policy decisions are
explicitly made to maximize general prosperity, ensuring that technological advancements,
including quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and biotech (among others), are harnessed
to improve quality of life rather than exacerbating inequalities.


Polarization within society is significantly reduced. By embracing localized decision-making and
**participatory democracy**, Europe ensures that diverse voices are actively involved in shaping
policies that affect them. This is further helped by a widespread adoption of digital platforms for
civic engagement. Proactive measures against disinformation and digital manipulation preserve
trust in public discourse, reinforcing societal cohesion.
## Long-term Resilience

Ensuring Europe's long-term resilience requires proactive investment in a high-tech industry and
a robust research & innovation base capable of securing economic control points in emerging
value chains. By fostering cutting-edge sectors such as quantum computing, artificial
intelligence, biotechnology, and next-generation materials, Europe can position itself at the
forefront of technological innovation. This requires **sustained funding for RD&I**, support for
**deep-tech startups** and mechanisms to **accelerate technology transfer** from research
institutions to industry, as well as societal adoption. A long-term vision ensures that the EU does
not merely adopt technologies developed elsewhere but actively shapes global technological
trajectories.


Resilience is an essential component of steering transitions, allowing crises to be managed
effectively without adversely affecting longer-term aims. Europe must develop the institutional
capacity to **track economic, technological, and societal shifts in real time**, using data-driven
insights to inform policy adjustments. This includes establishing **early warning systems** for
economic disruptions, anticipating geopolitical shifts, and responding dynamically to
technological breakthroughs. Crucially, resilience also requires the political courage to
**discontinue policies and investments that are underperforming** . Policymakers must move
away from inertia-driven governance and embrace a culture of adaptive learning—one that
allows for recalibration in response to new evidence, even if it means reversing prior decisions.
This shift demands a governance environment where experimentation is encouraged, and
failures are recognized as opportunities for refinement rather than political liabilities.


To ensure that decision-making aligns with Europe's long-term vision, the EU must establish a
harmonized **European General Prosperity Framework** —a comprehensive assessment model
that moves beyond traditional economic indicators like GDP. This framework should integrate
measures of environmental sustainability, public health, social equity, and technological
sovereignty, creating a more holistic understanding of progress. By embedding this framework
into policy evaluation and investment decision-making, Europe can systematically prioritize
actions that enhance societal well-being while maintaining economic competitiveness. Such a
model would serve as both a strategic guide for policymakers and a transparency tool for the
public, reinforcing accountability and trust in governance.


## Synergies and Tensions

When pursuing multiple priorities, synergies and tensions inevitably arise. For instance,
balancing industrial protection with support for free trade is a complex trade-off, while growing
well-being seems synergistic with restoring natural capital. However, these priorities are not
isolated; they interact within a complex system with numerous feedback loops that span
different geographical regions, sectors, and timescales. What might appear as a simple policy
choice can have far-reaching consequences, with both positive and negative effects that unfold
over time.


The interconnection of priorities means that investments or policies in one area can have
cascading impacts in others. For example, advancing cutting-edge industries such as quantum
computing could strengthen Europe’s technological sovereignty, but without careful regulation,
it might exacerbate inequalities between regions. Similarly, policies aimed at restoring natural
ecosystems might initially slow industrial growth, but they can lead to long-term economic
resilience by enhancing environmental sustainability.


Truly understanding the synergies and tensions requires **consideration of higher-order**
**impacts, delayed feedback loops**, and the unpredictable nature of human behaviour. For
instance, short-term economic benefits from certain policies might overshadow their longerterm societal or environmental costs. Likewise, policies aimed at improving citizen well-being
may not immediately align with growth objectives but could ultimately contribute to a more
productive and resilient workforce.
## Enhancing Strategic Foresight

To strengthen the European Union’s strategic foresight capabilities, it is essential to integrate
advanced methodologies that can capture the complexity of future systems and identify the
interactions and feedback loops that shape them. One powerful approach is **combining**
**foresight with System Dynamics**, a technique that models the interdependencies and
feedback loops within complex systems. By incorporating System Dynamics into foresight work,
the EU can develop more accurate, flexible, and actionable insights into future developments,
enabling better decision-making for long-term planning.


System Dynamics allows for a deeper understanding of how various elements within a system
influence one another over time, making it an ideal tool for capturing the nuanced feedback
loops that often drive unexpected outcomes. This approach can take several forms:


1. **Developing future scenarios and then modelling the system of the future** : This

involves envisioning different potential futures and using System Dynamics to model
how the system would behave in each of those scenarios. By focusing on how elements
interact in the future, the EU can anticipate risks, identify opportunities, and prepare for
multiple possible outcomes.
2. **Creating a System Dynamics model of the current system, while developing future**

**scenarios in parallel** : In this approach, policymakers first build a model of the current
system, then explore how it might behave under different future scenarios. This allows
for an understanding of how existing structures and processes might respond to future
shocks or shifts, helping to identify areas that need adaptation.
3. **Creating a model of the current system while developing a preferred future and**

**backcasting** : Backcasting involves starting from a desirable future state and working
backwards to understand the steps necessary to achieve that vision. This method helps


pinpoint the changes that need to be made within the current system to reach the
preferred future, ensuring that strategic decisions are aligned with long-term goals.


For all of these approaches, **scoping the system-of-interest** is crucial. The scope must be
narrow enough to be manageable, yet broad enough to incorporate the key factors that will
shape the envisioned future. For instance, in the context of Europe's strategic autonomy and
global competitiveness, the system-of-interest could focus on sectors like the **European space**
**industry**, which relies on international collaboration, critical raw materials, and has far-reaching
impacts on defence, high-tech innovation, and geopolitical stability. The system must be
relevant at the European level, considering the complex interactions across borders, industries,
and policies.


At TNO **we have piloted combining System Dynamics with foresight methodologies** to model
the cascading effects of Arctic melting (as an illustrative use case). This pilot demonstrated the
potential for System Dynamics to enhance foresight work, allowing for a better understanding of
the complex feedback loops at play in global and regional systems.


Building on this, we believe that the EU can benefit from a collaborative methodology that
incorporates these insights and pilot findings. By combining the insights from System Dynamics
and foresight, Europe can not only anticipate future challenges but also create actionable
pathways for achieving its long-term objectives. Our experience with this approach positions us
well to support the development of such methodologies, ensuring they are practical, robust, and
tailored to European priorities.
