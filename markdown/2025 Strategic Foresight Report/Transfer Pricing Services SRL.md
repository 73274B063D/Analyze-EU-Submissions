**Contribution to the European Commission’s Call for Evidence on**


**2025 Strategic Foresight Report**


19 March 2025
Bucharest, Romania


I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this call for evidence on 2025 Strategic Foresight
Report. In my view, any vision for a resilient EU must be grounded in the harsh realities ahead:


- **Demographic challenges:** By 2040, “ _the EU’s workforce is projected to shrink by nearly_
_2 million workers annually, while the ratio of working to retired people will decline from_
_approximately 3:1 to 2:1”_ (Draghi Report, 2024);

- **Geopolitical shifts** : By 2040, Europe will not only lose its _“demographic dividend”_
(when economic growth is supported by a rising population”, but the era of “ _the_ _peace_
_dividend will be long gone”_ (von der Leyen, 2025);

- **Increased defense spending:** “ _The Readiness 2030”_ initiative, aimed at strengthening
European defense, is expected to reshape budgets, with military expenditures rising to
5–7% of GDP (European NATO/EDU scenarios, EPRS – The Future European Security
Architecture, 2025);

- **Economic and environmental costs:** The _“green premium”_ initiative reflects the
financial burden associated with the green energy transition and climate mitigation
efforts (ESPAS – Global Trends to 2040).


With these developments in mind, it is reasonable to envision a future where “ _revenues from_
_trade have declined, but Europe heavily taxes both businesses and individuals. These tax_
_revenues are used to finance a substantial EU resilience fund that supports social equality across_
_the EU. Where the EU admits it or not, this fund has led to an internal societal debate on which_
_socio-economic paradigm is the most effective_ ” (Joint Research Centre – Reference Foresight
Scenarios 2040).


Therefore, in my view **, any paradigm we adopt must begin with redefining the relationship**
**between the citizen (taxpayer) and the state (administration).** The EU can no longer afford
a system where Big Data is used solely to combat presumed tax avoidance rather than to
understand and incentivize compliant taxpayer behavior.


A new level-playing society should uphold transparency not only for taxpayers but also for
administrations. The principle of _“no taxation without representation_ ” must be more than a
slogan. What needs to be done?


- Reduce the tax compliance burden;

- Implement real and meaningful simplifications;

- Introduce regulatory sandboxes to test innovative tax policies;

- Increase accountability in tax administration;

- Use the power of AI to empower the taxpayers, to understand their taxing rights and
obligations!


A truly open society acknowledges that, whether we like it or not, if corporate power continues
to expand, “ _large corporations may need to be given a greater voice than they have today within_
_international organisations that establish global standards and co-ordinate responses to global_
_challenges such as climate change, national security and technological safety_ ” (OECD, Strategic
Foresight Toolkit, 2025).


**In short, readiness for 2040 (and beyond) must involve a shift toward a dialogue between**
**unbiased algorithms — those of tax administrations and those of taxpayers — as well as a**
**true partnership between governments and taxpayers, united by common long-term**
**goals.**
