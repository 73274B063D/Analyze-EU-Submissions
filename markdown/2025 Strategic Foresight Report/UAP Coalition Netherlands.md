### Summary

The 2025 Strategic Foresight Report presents an important opportunity for the European
Commission to strengthen the EU’s long-term resilience by identifying and addressing
emerging strategic uncertainties. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) represent one
such uncertainty, with potential implications for security, aviation safety, energy
infrastructure, and scientific research. UAP Coalition Netherlands, an independent non-profit
organization representing aviation, armed forces, and law enforcement professionals,
advocates for greater awareness, research, and policy measures to ensure that UAP are
properly addressed within the EU’s strategic planning.

Countries such as France, the United States, China, and Russia have already taken steps to
investigate and regulate UAP. France’s GEIPAN, the U.S. Department of Defense’s AARO,
and recent U.S. legislation on UAP highlight the increasing international recognition of this
issue. Observations of UAP near critical infrastructure, including nuclear facilities and military
sites, further demonstrate the importance of including UAP in EU policy discussions. Despite
these developments, the EU has yet to establish a coordinated approach to UAP research,
reporting, and risk assessment, leaving a critical gap in its resilience strategy.

As the 2025 Strategic Foresight Report seeks to enhance policy coherence and
preparedness, UAP Coalition Netherlands urges the Commission to integrate UAP into key
policy areas, including EU Space Law, Energy Security Architecture, EU Flight Safety and
Research & Innovation. Such integration will ensure that the EU remains at the forefront of
scientific innovation, security preparedness, and international cooperation.

Addressing UAP within this Call for Evidence will enable the Commission to strengthen
transparency, enhance resilience, and align EU policy with global best practices. Moreover,
this initiative echoes the formal written reply from September 2023 on behalf of President
von der Leyen, in which the Commission highlighted the importance of detecting UAP in the
space environment.

### What is UAP Coalition Netherlands?

UAP Coalition Netherlands [1] is an independent non profit NGO that represents the interests
of professionals within aviation, armed forces and law enforcement who observe(d)
Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. We promote support, research, awareness,
cooperation and regulations regarding UAP.

### What are Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena?


Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is anything in space and air, on land, and in the
sea that cannot be identified. In the past, the term Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) was
used but as improved sensor platforms started detecting more phenomena in other domains
(in particular the sea), a new acronym and definition was adopted.

### Why UAP Coalition Netherlands?


The Coalition was created out of necessity because professionals within aviation, armed
forces and law enforcement do not feel safe and heard if they have experience with UAP.

The positive developments of legislation and regulations in other countries show that the
European Union cannot lag behind on the topic of UAP. UAPCNL wants to inform, advise
and support the EU government and involved organizations in the EU about UAP.

### UAP Are Real

As technological progress increases, observations [2] are increasingly supported by a range of
sensors and measuring instruments including radar, infrared, cameras and other sensor
platforms. This is why it becomes more difficult to dismiss UAP as fiction.

Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena appear to demonstrate a particular focus on energy
infrastructure, with a worrisome frequency of sightings reported near atomic facilities [3],
nuclear-powered vessels, and military sites housing nuclear weapons [4] .

France has an official government organization [5] (GEIPAN) that collects, analyzes, and
reports on UAP. It operates under the French Space Agency [6] (CNES) and focuses
exclusively on cases within France.

Former United States Presidents such as Barack Obama, current US President Donald
Trump and other prominent figures have publicly spoken about UAP. In various interviews [7]
they confirm the existence of objects that cannot be explained and that these are observed
in American airspace and around the globe.

On 22 July 2022 the United States Pentagon created a department (AARO [8] ) where
government personnel can report their UAP sightings. So far over 1600 cases have been
filed and AARO releases a report [9] every year on their findings. Several hundred are still not
explained.

Since 2022 the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics has a special committee [10]
dedicated to improving aerospace safety by increasing scientific knowledge about UAP and
reducing stigma and barriers to the study of UAP.

On September 14, 2023, the NASA Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Independent Study
Team published its final report [11] with a series of recommendations on how the agency can
advance their understanding of UAP. NASA promised to continue their research on UAP and
appointed a special UAP Research Director.

On December 14, 2023, legislation was passed [12] by the United States Senate specifically for
UAP. In terms of content, the law is mainly about transparency and research.

On January 25, 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense Office of Inspector General
released [13] a UAP report. The conclusion is _“We determined that the DoD has no overarching_
_UAP policy and, as a result, it lacks assurance that national security and flight safety threats_
_to the United States from UAP have been identified and mitigated”_ .

On 13 November 2024 a joint US congressional subcommittee held a hearing [14] to explore a
variety of observations and allegations regarding UAP. Four witnesses provided testimonies.
The hearing provided a comprehensive exploration of evidence, concerns, and revelations
about UAP and their implications for science, safety, and national security. Congress gave
bipartisan support for legislative measures, including: a proposed Safe Airspace for
Americans Act which encourages civilian pilots to report UAP without fear of stigma and a
proposed UAP Disclosure Act that seeks to declassify UAP materials and establish oversight
mechanisms.

Furthermore, many advocates for UAP transparency are urging the new Trump
administration to take swift action, calling for an urgent investigation and greater government
accountability [15] .

A **special note** which must be mentioned is that China [16] and Russia [17] both take the UAP
topic very seriously and consider UAP a security threat and flight safety risk. For example
China uses artificial intelligence to conduct research into UAP.

### Introduction

The European Commission’s 2025 Strategic Foresight Report presents an important
opportunity to strengthen the European Union’s long-term resilience by anticipating
challenges and formulating informed policy responses. As the EU navigates an increasingly
complex and uncertain global landscape, it is essential to identify and address all potential
strategic uncertainties—including those posed by Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena
(UAP).

UAP Coalition Netherlands strongly supports the Commission’s foresight-driven approach to
policy making and urges the inclusion of UAP within the broader discourse on European
resilience. There are four key reasons why UAP merit attention in this Call for Evidence:

**UAP as a Strategic Uncertainty**
UAP fall into the category of emerging and poorly understood phenomena that could have
significant geopolitical, scientific, and security implications. As the EU seeks to anticipate
and prepare for future disruptions, it is crucial to assess the potential risks and opportunities
associated with UAP and ensure they are not overlooked in long-term policy considerations.

**Scientific and Technological Relevance**
The EU prioritizes research and innovation to maintain its competitive edge. A transparent
and structured approach to UAP research can contribute to advancements in aerospace,
sensor technology, and other scientific fields. By proactively addressing this topic, the EU
can ensure that its policies remain aligned with cutting-edge technological and scientific
developments.

**Democratic Transparency and Public Trust**
The EU is committed to openness and accountability, particularly in areas affecting security
and public interest. A coherent approach to UAP—rooted in transparency and data
sharing—can foster trust in EU institutions while ensuring that policymakers, scientists, and
the public have access to reliable information.

**Policy Synergies and Global Developments**
Legislative advancements in other countries, such as the United States but also China and
Russia, highlight the increasing international recognition of UAP as a relevant policy issue.
The EU cannot afford to lag behind. Aligning EU policies with global best practices will
strengthen cooperation, enhance preparedness, and ensure a coordinated approach across
Member States.

By integrating UAP into strategic foresight discussions, the European Commission has the
opportunity to address a growing area of concern, promote scientific progress, and reinforce
the EU’s commitment to resilience and preparedness. UAP Coalition Netherlands welcomes
the chance to contribute to this dialogue and provide evidence-based insights to support the
Commission’s work.

### Integrating UAP into EU Policy-Making

UAPCNL believes that integrating Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena into EU
policy-making is essential for proactively addressing emerging risks and seizing new
opportunities across key sectors. As technological advancements expand our detection
capabilities, it becomes increasingly important to update regulatory and operational
frameworks in line with international developments. This section outlines a comprehensive
strategy for UAP integration, focusing on four critical areas: EU Space Law, Energy Security
Architecture, EU Flight Safety and Research & Innovation.

UAPCNL has provided feedback on multiple Calls for Evidence issued by the European
Commission, emphasizing the need to integrate Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP)
into key policy areas. In the upcoming EU Space Law [18] aligning legal frameworks with global
best practices will enhance space surveillance and facilitate data sharing, ensuring the EU
remains at the forefront of technological and security developments. In Energy Security
Architecture [19], implementing robust reporting and risk assessment mechanisms will help
protect critical infrastructure from potential UAP-related disruptions.

In October 2024 UAPCNL coordinated an urgent call for EU action on UAP to the European
Parliament [20] by fifteen civil society organisations from ten EU countries, Norway and the
United Kingdom.

EU Space Law

Our proposal [21] advocates integrating Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) into the EU
Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) service managed by the EU Agency for the Space
Programme (EUASP). This new addition aligns with the existing services of Collision
Avoidance, Re-entry Analysis, and Fragmentation Analysis.

To comprehensively address UAP, the SST Research and Development plan should be
expanded to assess existing and required sensor capabilities for UAP observation. Historical
sensor data, including archived observations, should be scrutinized for past collision risks.

All UAP data, past, present, and future, should be made publicly accessible.

Additionally, the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) service, which monitors natural objects
approaching Earth, should incorporate UAP data. This collaboration should be coordinated
with the European Space Agency's (ESA) Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC),
with a commitment to collecting, analyzing, and publicly sharing relevant NEO data.

Facilitating the reporting of UAP observations by astronauts and space agency personnel is
emphasized, emphasizing a stigma-free environment. The EU Space Law needs to
specifically address this.

A harmonized reporting system across EU Member States is recommended, with a central
EU repository for data acquisition, handling, analysis and public reporting. The European
Union may fund independent organizations such as UAP Coalition Netherlands. The UAP
Coalition Netherlands is available to support the establishment of such a central EU
repository, through advice on its design and operation. Eventually we could also participate
in its operation depending on for example availability of funds and legal frameworks. This
could also be done in collaboration with other relevant organizations.

Finally, our proposal suggests establishing a new EU UAP Space Research program at
EUASP (and/or ESA), with a Research Director similar to what NASA recently has
announced.

A **special** **note** that in September 2023 a formal reply [22] about UAP on behalf of President
von der Leyen was written, in which the European Commission expressed their opinion on
the importance of detecting UAP in the space environment. This emphasizes the need for
UAP to be a part of the EU Space Law.

Energy Security Architecture

UAP Coalition Netherlands (UAPCNL) identified [23] significant gaps in the current EU energy
security architecture in addressing the low-probability but high-risk threat posed by
Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). This oversight is concerning, especially as other
countries recognize UAP as a legitimate security and safety risk. To address this, UAPCNL
proposes three key actions namely;

Incorporating robust Investigation and Research for UAP into the EU’s energy security
framework is essential to future-proof Europe’s critical infrastructure. By establishing formal
reporting mechanisms and conducting thorough risk assessments the EU can ensure that its
energy systems are resilient against all potential threats, including the challenges posed by
UAP. Multi- and transdisciplinary research and innovative approaches are required, with
sufficient funding through the EU research and innovation programme Horizon Europe.

Through proactive policies and measures, Europe can enhance the safety and reliability of
its energy supply, regardless of the origin or nature of UAP. UAP integration in Energy
Security Policies to address emerging challenges for energy security is necessary to ensure
the protection of critical infrastructure. This should be done by integrating findings from
investigation and research into existing security protocols and by integrating UAP monitoring
into surveillance frameworks. Integration of UAP in a future EU preparedness strategy is
also recommended. By expanding airspace and satellite surveillance, utilizing AI-driven
detection, and coordinating efforts across borders, the EU can effectively monitor UAP
activity and mitigate potential risks. Enhanced surveillance that accounts for UAP threats will
fortify Europe’s energy systems against both conventional and unconventional threats,
ensuring a more secure and resilient energy future.


International Collaboration is crucial in strengthening the EU’s energy security, particularly in
the face of threats such as UAP. By building global partnerships, coordinating surveillance
and monitoring efforts, sharing intelligence, and engaging in collaborative research, the EU
can play a leading role in integrating UAP risks into energy security. A conference on UAP
and energy security could be organized involving the EU institutions, Member States, UAP
experts and stakeholders from the energy community.

EU Flight Safety

On 31 January 2024, a Member of Parliament raised three pivotal questions [24] regarding the
reporting, analysis, and management of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) under
Regulation (EU) No 376/2014. In a response issued on 11 April 2024, the EC stated [25] that
there was no need to amend the current legislation, as UAP are classified under “Unknown
Airborne Objects” within the established civil aviation safety reporting framework.

However, research conducted by UAP Coalition Netherlands indicates that this category
does not exist—in particular, the ECCAIRS2 reporting system does not feature a distinct
category for UAP, a concern confirmed during discussions with DG MOVE on 9 July 2024. In
light of these findings, UAPCNL proposed that the category “Unidentified Anomalous
Phenomena” be adopted. This change would better align EU terminology with international
standards, facilitate more accurate data collection, and ultimately enhance flight safety by
establishing a harmonized, transparent, and participatory reporting system across Member
States for civil, space, and military applications.

Unfortunately, a separate category has not been implemented, and the European
Commission has not updated its response. As a result, inaccurate information is being
disseminated, which undermines democratic principles. Although the EU is committed to
openness and accountability—especially in areas affecting security and the public
interest—this misinformation ultimately erodes public trust.

UAP Coalition Netherlands maintains a dedicated YouTube [26] channel featuring numerous
witness testimonies from aviation professionals who express their concerns about flight
safety.

Research & Innovation: Advancing European Excellence in UAP Studies


Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) represent a strategic area of inquiry with
far-reaching implications across multiple scientific and technological domains. As the
European Commission’s 2025 Strategic Foresight Report calls for enhanced resilience and
informed policy-making, it is imperative that research and innovation on UAP receive
targeted attention and funding. Establishing clear research priorities and incorporating UAP
into the EU Horizon programme will not only address potential security and safety concerns
but also stimulate breakthroughs in fundamental science and advanced technology.

To harness the full potential of UAP research, the European Union should identify and
prioritize opportunities that span a wide range of disciplines. Investigations into fundamental
physics, astronomy, and meteorology can provide insights into the natural phenomena
underlying UAP observations, while studies in biology and human health effects can assess
any potential impacts on public well-being. In parallel, research into advanced materials,
industrial manufacturing, and new technologies for energy, transport, and information and
communication systems will drive innovations that benefit both the economy and society.
The integration of artificial intelligence for data analysis is crucial in managing the large
datasets generated by UAP observations, ensuring that insights are derived efficiently and
accurately.

Targeted EU funding is essential to foster interdisciplinary research and innovation in this
emerging field. We recommend that UAP be formally included in the EU Horizon
programme, with dedicated funding streams provided through key agencies and institutes. In
particular, the European Research Council, the European Innovation Council, and the
European Institute of Innovation and Technology should be engaged to support fundamental
and applied research projects. Additionally, leveraging the European Defence Fund can help
bridge the gap between scientific exploration and national security applications. Such
coordinated funding efforts will not only accelerate scientific discovery but also promote
technological advancements that could have significant spin-off benefits across multiple
sectors.

A comprehensive EU research strategy on UAP will position Europe as a global leader in
addressing a phenomenon that touches on security, technological innovation, and scientific
inquiry. By integrating UAP research into existing funding frameworks and establishing clear
priorities, the European Commission can drive cross-disciplinary collaboration and ensure
that emerging insights are translated into practical solutions. This proactive approach will
enhance the EU’s capacity for strategic foresight and resilience, aligning with broader goals
of innovation and competitiveness on the international stage.

### Recommendations

It is clear that UAP are not only real but also carry significant implications for safety, security,
and scientific inquiry. Drawing on international developments and research, UAPCNL offers
the following strategic recommendations in response to the Commission’s Call for Evidence.


**1. Integrate UAP into EU Space Law and Surveillance**


●​ **EU Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST):** Incorporate UAP observations into the

EU Space Surveillance and Tracking service managed by the EU Agency for the
Space Programme (EUASP). Expanding the SST research and development plan to
assess sensor capabilities for UAP detection and historical data analysis will
strengthen our understanding of these phenomena.
●​ **Central Repository and Collaboration:** Establish a central EU repository for UAP

data that is accessible to all stakeholders. Consider funding independent
organizations, such as UAP Coalition Netherlands, to advise on the repository’s
design and operation. Moreover, integrate UAP data into the Near-Earth Objects
(NEO) monitoring process in collaboration with the European Space Agency’s (ESA)
Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC).
●​ **Dedicated UAP Research Program:** Launch an EU UAP Space Research program

at EUASP or in collaboration with ESA, modeled on successful initiatives from other
countries in particular the US (NASA), to advance scientific research and policy
recommendations.


**2. Strengthen EU Energy Security Architecture**


●​ **Incorporate UAP Risk Assessments:** Recognize UAP as a potential threat to

critical energy infrastructure, such as nuclear facilities and energy grids. Integrate
formal UAP reporting and risk assessment mechanisms into the EU’s energy security
framework.
●​ **Enhanced Surveillance and Monitoring:** Expand airspace and satellite

surveillance, utilize AI-driven detection methods, and ensure coordinated
cross-border monitoring of UAP activity. These measures will enhance the resilience
of Europe’s energy systems.
●​ **Foster International Collaboration:** Organize conferences and collaborative

research initiatives involving EU institutions, Member States, UAP experts, and
energy sector stakeholders to share insights and best practices on mitigating
UAP-related risks.

**3.** **Update Aviation Legislation and Reporting Framework**


●​ **Adopt Updated Terminology:** Amend Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 to add

“Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.” This change aligns with international wording
standards and ensures that the terminology accurately reflects the broader range of
phenomena now being observed.
●​ **Enhance Data Collection:** Modify the existing ECCAIRS2 reporting system to

include a dedicated category for UAP. This will facilitate more accurate data
collection, risk assessment, and analysis, supporting evidence-based
decision-making in aviation safety.


**5. Promote Transparency, Participation, and Public Trust**


●​ **Harmonized, Participatory Reporting:** Develop a harmonized, transparent, and

stigma-free reporting system for UAP across Member States. Ensure that all relevant
stakeholders—including civil, space, and military personnel—can report observations
without fear of negative repercussions.
●​ **Open Data and Accountability:** Publicly share UAP data to bolster accountability

and foster trust in EU institutions. A participatory approach that includes the input of
experts and affected professionals will reinforce the EU’s commitment to openness
and democratic accountability.


**6. Establish priorities and provide funding for EU research on UAP**


●​ **Identify opportunities for research and innovation** in for example fundamental

physics, astronomy, meteorology, biology, human health effects, advanced materials,
industrial manufacturing, new technologies for energy, transport, information and
communication, and the use of artificial intelligence for data analysis.
●​ **Provide EU funding for research and innovation,** by including UAP in the EU

Horizon programme through the main relevant EU agencies and institutes, such as
the European Research Council, the European Innovation Council, the European
Institute of Innovation and Technology, and the European Defence Fund.
