feedback: 'The insurance industry works every day to protect people and businesses.
  UNESPA is the Spanish Association of Insurers and is member of Insurance Europe.
  The association was founded in 1977 and represents approximately 200 insurers that
  together cover almost all the insurance business in Spain. These undertakings have
  a turnover of 62,000 million euros every year, or in other words, almost 5.1% of
  Spanish gross domestic product (GDP). They protect assets and people, which are
  valued at more than 10 times the GDP of Spain. UNESPA highly appreciates the focus
  of the 2025 Strategic Foresight Report on resilience. The Commission efforts to
  strengthen consistency and synergies between all EU policies aiming to promote long-term
  resilience will certainly contribute to the success in moving towards a safer and
  more prosperous future for all Europeans. The insurance industry is willing to work
  closely and constructively with the Commission, supporting initiatives that strengthen
  the resilience of Europe''s economy and society. That includes initiatives to enhance
  preparedness and close existing protection gaps in a number of areas, such as climate
  risks or cyber risks, among other threats and hazards, as highlighted in the Niinisto
  report. To enhance preparedness, policymakers should carry out initiatives to raise
  awareness among citizens and businesses about risks facing them and their properties
  and about existing protection gaps. Policymakers should also implement initiatives
  to increase the insurability of risks. That would include risk prevention and risk
  protection awareness policies for both the public and private sectors. Furthermore,
  appropriate regulatory frameworks for prevention should be developed and appropriate
  incentives should be established for companies to invest in these prevention and
  protection measures, including financial support to SMEs by public aid through European
  funds. Insurance coverage provides financial protection and helps swift recovery
  from damage, but insurers cannot provide cover without data. Therefore, policymakers
  should ensure insurers can access and make use of data. This includes allowing customers
  to consent to sharing data from their vehicles, apps, and personal devices. Data
  is vital across all areas of insurance for pricing, risk analysis, risk mitigation
  and prevention, innovation, and fraud detection and prevention. In order to close
  the protection gap in the EU, public-private partnerships should be promoted, in
  particular in the area of increasingly frequent and severe extraordinary climate
  risks. The EU faces significant investment requirements to address climate change,
  enhance security, attain self-sufficiency in energy, food, and technology, and finance
  growth. To meet these demands, it is essential to close the pension savings gap
  and to increase retail investments including through insurance savings and retirement
  products. Closing the pension savings gap and providing financial security for individuals
  in a context of ageing populations, requires the implementation of measures such
  as: pension savings gap calculation tools to inform all workers annually about their
  estimated future pension; incentives to savings in supplementary occupational (second
  pillar) and individual (third pillar) pension schemes, the development of automatic
  enrolment employment systems; or the development of a pension dashboard, as proposed
  by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to monitor
  the evolution of the three pillars of pension systems in the Member States. To increase
  the retail participation in the financial markets, policymakers should simplify
  and modernise the investment process for Europeans, providing clear and streamlined
  customer information and avoiding disproportionate burden for financial providers
  without significant added value for customers. Finally, policymakers should continue
  efforts to strengthen the dialogue with all key stakeholders.'
