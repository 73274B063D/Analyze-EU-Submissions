feedback: 'The University of Bergen (UiB) appreciates the opportunity to give input
  in connection with the preparation of the Strategic Foresight report for 2025 and
  welcomes its timely focus on resilience. UiB wishes to emphasize the importance
  of long-term perspectives to ensure European resilience. We also encourage a broad
  understanding of the term, taking into account that a complex set of factors contribute
  to societal resilience, and consequently that knowledge from a broad range of fields
  is necessary for efficient knowledge-based policy-making for resilience. In demanding
  times with many challenges requiring immediate investment and effort, it is vital
  to remember that investment in research and research-based education and innovation
  upholds the necessary foundations for long-term resilience, and for the resilience
  of democratic societies in particular. European democracies and values as we know
  them today have developed in critical dialogue with European history and tradition
  over centuries. An inclusive public sphere open for critical discussion informed
  by knowledge, not only of current issues, but also of languages, history, and the
  rich multitude of cultural perspectives present in our societies, is a central part
  of our democratic interaction. To uphold this, we need free independent media, quality
  education and strong research environments within the whole range of disciplines,
  including social sciences, humanities, law and art (SSHA-disciplines). In general,
  research, education and innovation secure the knowledge and competences needed for
  efficient policies for resilience and competitiveness now and in the coming years,
  and lay the basis for discovering the knowledge and developing the competences we
  need in the longer term that we do not yet envisage. Research and education of the
  highest quality is a clear strength of European countries, built through long-term
  investments in universities and other research institutions. To be able to meet
  the various challenges we face globally and in Europe, it is vital to continue strengthening
  the European Research Area and thereby the European research and innovation ecosystem.
  This requires promoting and protecting academic freedom, improving career opportunities
  for younger researchers and providing funding opportunities for researchers and
  innovators along the whole continuum from fundamental research to innovation for
  the market or societal implementation. To attain this, it is crucial that the EU
  continues its commitment to research and innovation (R&I) through a stand-alone
  framework programme for R&I with a strong and ring-fenced budget in the next Multiannual
  Financial Framework. UiB wishes to point to the research areas listed below as central
  for the resilience of European societies, and as areas where European collaboration
  provides clear added value. We recommend that they be prioritized in the last years
  of the current framework programme for R&I, Horizon Europe, and in the next, 10th,
  framework programme (FP10): Children and youth Climate Democracy and sustainable,
  just and inclusive societies Digitilization and Artificial Intelligence Efficient
  energy systems and energy systems management Health Oceans and the blue economy
  Sustainable area management These interconnected areas require both basic and interdisciplinary
  research, with SSHA-disciplines integrated into all themes. Sufficient investment
  in infrastructure, including data-sharing systems and data stewardship roles, is
  essential for maximizing European R&I potential. To be able to mobilize excellent
  R&I environments in all sectors to participate in the programme, it will be of great
  importance to secure long-term stability with regard to the budget as well as rules
  and conditions. For further details on these research areas and further recommendations
  on FP10, we refer to UiBs recommendations concerning thematic priorities in FP10
  and UiBs Position paper on FP10 (attached).'

**Thematic priorities in the next EU research and innovation (R&I) programme**
The University of Bergen highlights the following areas as crucial for maintaining the necessary knowledge
preparedness and addressing the societal challenges facing Europe, where European R&I collaboration adds
significant value. These interconnected areas require both basic and interdisciplinary research, with SSHA
disciplines integrated into all themes. Sufficient investment in infrastructure, including data-sharing systems
and data stewardship roles, is essential for maximizing European R&I potential. To be able to mobilize
excellent R&I environments in all sectors to participate in the programme, it will be of great importance to
secure long-term stability with regard to the budget as well as rules and conditions.

**Health:** Health R&I are essential for addressing urgent challenges in all aspects of health care. Digitalization
is transforming patient care, but further research is needed to fully harness its potential in improving health
outcomes. In the coming years, **sharing of health data across Europe**, combined with **advancements in AI**
will be pivotal in addressing future health challenges.

Research is needed to address the alarming rise in **mental health** problems among children and
young people, as well as health issues posed by **an aging population** . The socioeconomic cost of
neurodegeneration is now higher than that of cardiovascular disease and cancer combined, and finding
solutions to these challenges is crucial for sustaining healthcare systems in Europe. Dedicated research on
**women's health** is needed to bridge the knowledge gaps related to gender-specific differences in physiology,
diagnosis, and disease progression. Additionally, the **health impacts of climate change and migration**
present complex issues that require coordinated, interdisciplinary research.

Through advanced surgery and new-generation drugs, a higher number of patients survive severe
**brain damage** . However, **more R&I is required to improve these patients’ quality of life**, and solutions in
this area have the potential to reduce long-term costs of medication and treatment and thereby reduce the
burden on the health sector.

**Precision medicine** holds significant promise in the treatment of serious diseases, including **cancer**,
but major advancements are still needed. This requires focus on **basic and translational medical research**
for better diagnostics and development of new treatment methods.

**Priority setting in health** and **inequalities in health** are related areas of increasing urgency as the
gap between what is technologically possible and what is financially viable is rapidly widening, increasing
pressures on public health systems. Health is a significant driver of economic inequality, and mechanisms for
setting fair priorities in health are key both for the health of the population and for social cohesion and
democratic legitimacy.

The **contributions of arts and art-based therapies in healthcare** should also be explored. A
comprehensive and collaborative approach will enable Europe to lead in health innovation while ensuring
the well-being of its citizens.

**Climate: Climate change represents one of the greatest challenges faced by human societies.** More
research is urgently needed to understand the processes determining climate change and the
multidimensional consequences, as well as the political, social, economic, and technological complexities of
mitigating and adapting to climate change. Basic and interdisciplinary research is critical, with particular focus
on three areas:
**A future ice-free Artic:** The Arctic Ocean may become ice-free during summer season within the
coming decades due to climate change. While scenarios remain uncertain, even transitional phases of
diminishing ice cover present both opportunities—such as new shipping routes and access to marine
resources—and significant threats, including climate feedback and ecosystem loss, with global implications.
To enable sustainable management and informed political decisions, more precise predictions of Arctic ice
conditions are essential, necessitating enhanced observations and deeper process understanding.
**Developing Ecosystem Prediction:** Integrated prediction systems that combine Earth System,
Ecosystem, and Social System models need to be developed and made ready for application. These tools,
enhanced by emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, can drive sustainable ecosystem management.
Advancing this research requires concerted international efforts.

**Just transformation:** Climate change will widen social inequalities, both within and between
societies, heightening the risk of social tensions. Transdisciplinary research is urgently needed to explore
pathways for societal transformation that address the climate and biodiversity crises while promoting social
justice and cohesion.


**Oceans, Climate and the Blue economy:** Our oceans are deeply affected by climate change and face multiple
other stressors. We need basic research to attain a better understanding of how oceans and ecosystems,
particularly coastal, Arctic, and deep-sea, are affected. The production of seafood must increase to provide a
healthy diet for all, and the marine sector has the potential to supply renewable energy production and
minerals, all of which require solid environmental impact assessment. This again requires increased
knowledge of marine biodiversity, particularly of mid-water and deep-sea communities and their
contributions to ecosystem services.

Coastal and shelf sea regions should receive particular attention as they emerge as a focal point of
the multiple impacts of climate change, land use, freshwater discharge, and land-based and sea-based
human activities. A key question is how to reconcile the necessity of restoration and biodiversity
conservation with the need for provision of more energy, food and bioresources from the sea. There is a
critical need for coordinated interdisciplinary and intersectoral research to increase our understanding of
coastal processes under multiple stressors. Further, we need research on the trade-offs between use and
conservation of the marine environment, as well as on cross-border governance and management principles.
Research is also needed on the regulatory and legislative framework. EU R&I funding in this area can create
tools necessary for knowledge-based policy decisions, including global climate models, digital twins of the
ocean, and data and monitoring systems.

**Efcient energy systems and energy system management:** To efficiently harvest intermittent, renewable
energy resources, and avoid over-investment in energy production, we need improved energy system
management tools, as well as high quality input data. At present, we lack an energy system management tool
that combines and allows interaction between new and existing tools for intelligent and automated power
system operation.

The introduction of large shares of unregulated power production from solar PV and wind power are
common to European countries and efficient solutions for energy storage at various time scales, energy
management and demand flexibility are needed. The legal and economic framework must be designed to
balance the need for energy security and sufficient production capacity and to avoid overinvestment and
unnecessary area use.

An integral part of optimal handling of unregulated power production is efficient use of surplus
energy, i.e. power-to-X. This includes novel, energy efficient methods for production of e.g. hydrogen and
ammonia, as well as safe storage and handling of such energy carriers.

**Sustainable area management:** Area is a scarce resource in Europe, and a source of potential conflicts
between different stakeholder interests, including court cases brought by traditional and indigenous
communities. In particular, a massive deployment of renewable energy will intensify current conflicts about
area use. More knowledge of how such processes can be structured to minimise conflicts and risks of human
rights abuse is needed.

A key question is how we can allow for _**maximum production of renewable energy while minimizing**_
_**ecological harm**_ by e.g. multiuse of areas and the use of ecologically degraded areas for renewable energy
development. Balancing energy production with climate mitigation and nature management will be crucial
for ensuring a just and sustainable development. This requires new knowledge of the costs associated with
loss of biodiversity, ecosystems, and ecosystem services in renewable energy projects, and developing digital
tools to integrate these into energy system models for informed decisions.


**Democracy and sustainable, just, and inclusive societes:** A range of developments over the past years has
resulted in new challenges for European democracies: shifting geopolitical landscapes; changing dynamics of


2

globalization and protectionism; widening inequalities; increased migration; climate change; new
developments in AI and other technologies; foreign interference and fake news influencing elections; and a
sharp increase in populist parties and movements challenging the liberal democratic order. To secure the
knowledge needed to protect and enhance sustainable, just, and inclusive democratic societies, R&I on these
issues should be prioritized. Areas of focus should include:

 - **Law and socio-legal research,** e.g. related to the green transition and AI, contemporary forms of
judicialization of politics and its consequences, the pressure on human rights and international law,
including legal frameworks related to migration and asylum, as well as research related to the study of
resilient and adaptable legal rules.

 - **Democracy in societal transformations** : The politics and governance of societal transformations are
exceedingly complex. They require far-sighted, often trans-generational decisions, and this raises
fundamental questions of how democratic participation and governance can be re-structured to enable
far-sighted decisions as well as broad participation.

 - **Inequality and inclusion** : Research on the nature and drivers of multidimensional and intersectional
inequalities should be prioritized along with research on barriers to, and mechanisms for social
inclusion.

 - **The role of cultural heritage for inclusive societies**, including Cultural Heritage Science.

**Children and youth:** In many European societies conditions for children and youth are worsening. Child
poverty is on the rise, as is child abuse, mental illness and suicide among children and youth, and serious
crime committed by children. Child migrants are particularly vulnerable. It is urgent to have a
transdisciplinary focus on how children can be better protected, included and enabled. There is great
potential for advancing actionable knowledge that can guide policies and improve children’s lives, by
mobilizing across a wide range of academic and professional silos and including children’s voices in research.

**Digitlizaton and Artfcial Intelligence:** As our societies become increasingly reliant on digital solutions and
AI, Europe must advance research within ICT, particularly in cybersecurity and AI, and its theoretical
underpinnings. Key research questions include how to make the ICT-systems and data secure, ensuring
privacy while maximizing data utility for individuals and society. This requires foundational research in
computer science and cybersecurity at all TRL-levels to maintain a strong knowledge base. Research is
needed to improve energy efficiency of algorithms, trustworthiness, and cybersecurity of e-infrastructures
and AI-systems. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential, combining informatics with natural sciences,
medicine, psychology, social sciences, humanities, law, and artistic research, to develop beneficial digital and
AI-solutions.

These topics should be addressed in the successor of pillar 2 in FP10, which is an important instrument for
universities in Horizon Europe. Cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary research and innovation creates added
value within the EU Programme. Open and competition-based calls for proposals through the renowned
cluster set-up and work programmes known from the present programme should continue in the next FP.
Where partnerships create an added value to such clusters, they can be set up and it is important to secure
Norwegian access to the partnerships relevant for the topics mentioned above. UiB regards partnerships
contributing to the green transition, such as Clean Hydrogen, Sustainable Blue Economy and Clean Energy
Transition as important for Norwegian actors. Within the health field, UiB recommends Norway’s
participation in the upcoming co-funded partnerships Rare Diseases, One Health Antimicrobial Resistance,
Pandemic preparedness, and Brain Health. We also recommend participation in the new partnership on
Resilient Cultural Heritage. For general reflections on **Missions and Partnerships**, UiB refers to the
[recommendations in our position paper on FP10: A New Framework Programme for Research and Innovaton](https://www.uib.no/sites/w3.uib.no/files/attachments/university_o_1.pdf)

### _September 2024_


### **ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF BERGEN**

The University of Bergen (UiB) is a modern, international research university. We are a
classical knowledge- and culture-bearing institution founded on European democratic values,
with academic freedom as a guiding principle. Long-term and fundamental research of high
international quality and research-based education form the foundation of all our activities.
Our wide-ranging academic expertise fosters the deep specialization and interdisciplinary
collaboration which equip us to address current and future challenges.

UiB has participated in the EU Framework Programmes for R&I since their inception and is
among the most successful universities in Norway in securing funding across the
Programmes’ funding portfolio. UiB emphasizes that the Framework Programme plays a
critical role in supporting European and international research and innovation, promoting
scientific breakthroughs, solutions to societal and global challenges and groundbreaking
innovations.


### **INTRODUCTION**

Because of the central role that R&I plays in determining European competitiveness, it shapes the context
for present discussions around the EU’s next Framework Programme for R&I (FP10). The University of
Bergen (UiB) strongly promotes a holistic, systematic approach to competitiveness and to the many
contributions that can be made by R&I. This implies that we update our understanding of competitiveness
to take into account the need for comprehensive, long-term sustainability. Delivering a strong budget for
European R&I is critical for European competitiveness. UiB is a key initiator of the [Research Matters](https://research-matters.eu/)
[campaign. This aims to mobilize and unite the European research and innovation community in](https://research-matters.eu/)
advocating for a doubling of the FP10 budget and increase awareness of the vital importance of research.

In the current context, where we confront the complex and intertwined crises of climate change,
biodiversity loss, and pollution, along with challenges connected to demographics, threats to democracy,
and health and security risks, it is clear that our understanding of competitiveness cannot focus solely on
growth and increasing productivity. It must also include firm positions on long-term sustainability, wellbeing, and societal robustness. This requires us to take into account the limited availability of natural,
human, and other resources, the key societal roles of attractive jobs and social cohesion, and the need to
address the complex interests of people as social, political, historical, and cultural beings to secure wellfunctioning and just societies. It is equally clear that multi- and interdisciplinary research and innovation,
alongside research across all disciplines, will play a fundamental role in enhancing European
competitiveness in this new, broader sense. This position paper presents UiB’s recommendations for
FP10.

### **KEY MESSAGES FOR FP10**

**Excellence** : Scientific excellence and open competition should be guiding principles throughout FP10.


**Core European Values** : UiB supports a renewed focus on democratic values, academic freedom,
ethics, gender equality, and diversity in FP10.


**Boost the ERC and MSCA budgets** : The ERC and MSCA are highly successful instruments that foster
creativity and freedom in research by supporting excellent, researcher-initiated projects across all
fields. As flagships of European research, these bottom-up programmes should continue with
substantially increased budgets in the next Framework Programme to fully realize their potential,
support research careers, and avoid leaving talent untapped.


**Better balance in funding opportunities** : FP10 should ensure a balanced approach to funding basic
research, applied research, and innovation, and adequate support across the entire R&I landscape
from curiosity-driven to challenge-driven research and innovation.


Addressing the diverse challenges we face, such as climate change, healthy oceans, pollution,
biodiversity loss, health risks, the need for better medical treatments, and the transition to
renewable energy, requires a strong foundation in basic research. This is essential to enhance our
understanding of complex systems and processes and serves as a prerequisite for innovation and the
development of new technologies.


We therefore recommend introducing opportunities for **basic collaborative research** through
**Research Actions (RA) in the successor to Pillar II in FP10** . These Research Actions would support
explorative, challenge-oriented research projects with lower TRL-levels, facilitating collaboration
among leading research environments across Europe. This approach would provide a critical
knowledge base to inform responses to the global societal challenges addressed within FP10.


**Creativity, diversity, and freedom of research** : providing research funding that allows for creativity,
diverse perspectives, and freedom to choose research topics, approaches and methodologies is
crucial for Europe. Such support has the potential to generate the solutions and innovations of
tomorrow and to reinforce the foundations of European democracies, contributing to the open,
knowledge-based policymaking that is central to European values.


FP10 should be designed to promote creativity and a diversity of approaches, enabling European
research to reach its full potential. UiB recommends introducing **more open, less prescriptive Calls in**
**the successor to Pillar II**, and a greater variety of project sizes, making room for **smaller and more**
**explorative projects** in which researchers and innovators might test creative ideas on a smaller scale.
This would allow for a diversity of approaches to a given challenge and potentially to a more
comprehensive understanding and a greater number of complementary solutions. It would also
facilitate greater engagement of younger researchers and new actors in challenge-oriented projects.


**Social Sciences, Humanities and Art (SSHA)**, psychology and legal research are essential for
understanding and addressing societal and technological challenges. FP10 should ensure these fields
are fully integrated into all challenge-driven elements, with dedicated calls for projects that allow
these disciplines to define research topics on their own terms. This includes expanding opportunities
for the humanities and legal and artistic research, which have been underrepresented in Horizon
Europe and previous programmes. FP10 should also provide adequate funding for bottom-up
fundamental research and interdisciplinary research and innovation within these fields, ensuring a
comprehensive approach to tackling complex societal challenges.



4


**International cooperation:** FP10 should harness international cooperation and competition to secure
and enhance research quality, as far as is compatible with research security and ethical
considerations. Any measure developed or employed in FP10 should be designed and implemented
so that they do not jeopardize the possibility of R&I-cooperation between entities from the EU
Member States and the EEA EFTA States.


**An integrative approach to innovation and knowledge valorisation** : UiB recommends that FP10
strengthen innovation funding instruments and enhance valorization and impact by considering the
broader contexts in which innovations take place. The success of technological and non-technological
innovations – and their resulting societal impacts – are dependent on factors that include societal
acceptance, economic effects, legal frameworks, environmental sustainability, security concerns, and
unintended consequences. Innovation projects in FP10 should therefore be assessed against
indicators that ensure excellence and originality, and also economic, societal and environmental
sustainability (a techno-socio-sustainability approach) so that EU-supported innovations create
effects that are aligned with European core values. To achieve these objectives, a multi-disciplinary
effort is needed. FP10 funding instruments supporting innovation should therefore invite all
disciplines to contribute.


FP10 should further take into account that valorisation may follow more diverse knowledge transfer
routes than those primarily supported in Horizon Europe, and that the market may not always be the
main driver for value generation. Other mechanisms of valorisation include social innovation, the
erasing of inequalities, the strengthening of democracy, efficiency gains and savings in public and
private organisations, and change of policies, regulations and standards. FP10 should therefore also
target alternative knowledge transfer routes and support these through innovation funding
instruments and dedicated support systems.


**Simplification of rules and procedures** : FP10 should reduce the administrative burden for
participants.


**Easier access and increased transparency:**

The Commission should provide a clear and accessible overview of the different instruments
available in FP10. Work programmes should be fully digitalized with effective filtering options to
simplify navigation, making it easier for newcomers and smaller actors to participate.
The Commission should have a continued focus on securing transparent evaluation processes in
which applicants are given constructive guidance and feedback.
In general, the Commission should make processes connected to the implementation of the
programme more transparent – for example within Partnerships and in the shaping of thematic
challenges in Pathfinder Challenges.


**Dual use:** UiB recommends that FP10 remain a civilian programme and that R&I involving technology
with dual use potential is supported through the European Defense Fund. Better synergies between
FP10 and EDF may be sought through “spin-in” and “spin-out” calls in the European Defense Fund.


5


### **RECOMMENDATIONS ON SPECIFIC PROGRAMME COMPONENTS**

**MSCA** : MSCA is a bottom-up research programme that promotes brain circulation in Europe and
fosters cross-boarder connections. To further strengthen MSCA, the EU should consider introducing a
steering model similar to the ERC's independent Scientific Council which effectively engages
researchers in advancing research. Additionally, it would be advantageous to offer the possibility to
extend the duration of a MSCA PF from two to three years to give early career researchers more time
to consolidate their careers and become qualified for a tenure track or permanent position.


**Research infrastructure** : European collaboration on research infrastructure is highly successful,
providing obvious added value, and it is vital for the development of European science that this is
highly prioritized in FP10. FP10 should seek to maximize national investments in research
infrastructures through the continuation of a dedicated instrument for research infrastructures in
FP10. The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) should prioritize long-term,
sustainable funding for data steward initiatives. This would contribute to strengthening the European
data stewards’ community and enhance their ability to train the next generation of data stewards
under the ESFRI implementation agenda.


Initiatives to support sharing of health data across Europe should be continued and infrastructure that
facilitates sharing of health data should be prioritized.


**Missions** : The Missions should be thoroughly evaluated before deciding whether they should continue
in FP10. FP10 should in any event fund only Mission activities that clearly fall under the category of
research and innovation activities.


**KICs** : Knowledge and Innovation Communities should be structured according to a model that allows
universities to play a role beyond the end of the Commission’s funding period and to make their
valuable contributions to the important functions of education, innovation and technology transfer as
well as to life-long learning initiatives.


**Partnerships** :

UiB recommends limiting the number of Partnerships in FP10 and only establishing Partnerships
when such organization of the R&I effort provides a clear added value.
Opportunities for participation and engagement for different types of actors, including
universities, should be communicated in a more accessible manner.
Co-funded partnerships should to a greater extent include Calls for projects with lower TRL
thresholds.


**Innovation projects:**

introduce a new techno-socio-sustainability approach in assessing innovation and building project
portfolios;
increase and diversify innovation funding to give all disciplines a stake in European innovation
processes;
establish and fund mechanisms that support innovation following different knowledge transfer
routes that include, but go beyond, commercialization.
UiB would welcome further incentives for researchers who wish to innovate. The ERC Proof of
Concept works well and could be used as a template for instruments that could be made available
for a larger group, e.g. beneficiaries of MSCA and RIAs.


6


### **THEMATIC PRIORITIES**

_For the parts of the programme oriented towards addressing societal and global challenges, UiB wishes to_
_emphasize the following thematic areas:_


**CLIMATE CHANGE:**
R&I with a broad interdisciplinary approach is needed, including perspectives from health, SSHA,
psychology and legal research. Research on the future ice-free Arctic and the development of integrated
prediction systems that combine Earth system, Ecosystem and Social system models should receive
particular attention.


**OCEANS, CLIMATE AND THE BLUE ECONOMY:**
Our oceans are deeply affected by climate change and face multiple other stressors. Interdisciplinary and
intersectoral R&I and basic research are both urgently required to achieve a better understanding of how
oceans and ecosystems, particularly coastal, Arctic, and deep-sea, are affected.


**EFFICIENT ENERGY SYSTEMS AND ENERGY SYSTEM MANAGEMENT:**
To efficiently harvest intermittent, renewable energy resources, and avoid over-investment in energy
production, we need research into improved energy system management tools, as well as high quality
input data.


**HEALTH:**
Health R&I in the fields of aging, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, child health, women’s
health, mental health, multimorbidity, digitalization of healthcare, health issues connected to climate
change and migration, and precision and personalized medicine in relation to various diseases, including
cancer, are all required.


**DEMOCRACY:**
Democracy-relevant R&I with a broad, interdisciplinary approach, covering democratic issues in societal
transformations related to e.g. climate change and AI, including perspectives from psychological, legal,
cultural, philosophical, historical, literary, linguistic, and artistic research is required. Research on priority
setting should also be covered as key to handle limited resources in a sustainable way.


**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:**
Research and innovation on AI including disruption through AI and subsequent consequences is required.
This entails a multi- and interdisciplinary approach, in which perspectives from legal and psychological
research and the broad range of relevant SSHA-disciplines are included.
