feedback: '- Russian embassies in EU should have the bare minimum of personnel required
  for functioning and no consulates. -Tik Tok should be cyberattacked banned and/or
  highly regulated and audited- especially during elections, the Tik-Tok version that
  runs in China is different from any other version running anywhere else -Somehow
  Bots or Putins''s Trolls as Jessica Arro calls them should be stopped -If Trump
  manages to take USA out of NATO then the immediate joining of Ukraine should be
  approved, Moldova. -Trump follows his agenda 2025, that should be studied, he''s
  not playing 5D chess, or making good deals, he''s sabotaging the Pax-Americana,
  Breton-Woods order, Europe can become the greatest Economy -Azerbaijan, Moldova,
  Georgia should be helped financially and or militarily, if Russia can meddle so
  can EU, make it preocuppied, -Europe should take a very harsh stance on immigration
  and or migrants who solely live on social benefits and unemployed, uneducated posisbly
  deportation ,people dont even learn the host''s language, this is mainly why far
  right parties exist, bessides Russian support- listen to the Vox Populi, this is
  the most general EU citizen sentiment, and my own view. I would consult Dougles
  Murray and other such voices. -Get rid of every Russian and or Chinese influence,as
  much as possible - why are there Chinese police stations on EU soil where they can
  catch and persecute their dissidents, why does EU play nice withe everyone? I think
  energy sufficiency without US and Russia should be sought, so maybe switch to nuclear
  and electric instead of gas and oil. And watch carefully for Norway and Romania
  (and the russian sabotage of EU energy independence). -Make the EU army, copy the
  logistics of the US, invest in those heavily, and tanks, choose universal designs,
  even if countries have different models, now is not the time to make money from
  patents-buy from EU solely as you can''t count on US presidents and their whims,
  for continued spare parts, information, logistics. -What you can''t defend is not
  yours, and this soft generation even of EU leaders has forgotten that democracy
  has to be fought for. -The dictators are in a hybrid or hidden war with the West,
  ask Trump ask UKIP who funded them for Brexit, and qui bono- Russia, China. Research
  Telecom involvment of chinese, and their Investments and dumping strategies. They
  have a share or stake in every major area inside europe even video gaming and search
  engines for Christ''s sake,let alone telecom and internet providers, purge Huawei,
  if the world is going to be bad economically anyway why not clean house. -Help and
  monitor weak democracies in ex soviet countries, and where Russia had influence
  until 89, Germany Austria are next in line, it''s not just Slovakia,Hungary. Do
  something about Hungary''s Veto, if its Federalisation exceptional if its a coalition
  of the willing great. -Also prepare for a Balkan Conflict as that''s Russia''s next
  move, Serbia is in their pocket. -Open your dusty hybrid war books and strike back,
  if you want to have a democracy left to live in. -Think about Kaliningrad and how
  to sabotage the russian nukes, bribe those people or whatever. -Black Sea is extreme
  importance as Russia is already at NATO Border. -Send troops now, send aviation
  now, move air support there now, move anti aircraft there now, start building underground
  defense facilities now, start protecting EU energy infrastructure now, start fighting
  back, Biden dind''t want to go all in and destroy Russia because they didn''t want
  their nukes to fall on the wrong hands, this trickle has forced Russians to learn
  every western tactic and adapt, Electronic warfare makes a lot of western weapons
  obsolete, Russia has to loose and not be eaten by China, be immersed in history
  and wars, as that is the mindset needed for what is coming, we lived in a bubble,
  but history will repeat -conflict seems inevitable.'
