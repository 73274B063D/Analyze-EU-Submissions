## Key highlights

### 1 Water Efficiency Principle First

We need the reduction of water utilization by end users; water reuse and circularity measures; to eliminate
water losses; to include water efficiency as a metric in EU legislation; to promote digitalization.

### 2 European Water Resources Plan Development


We recommend water needs assessment for EU’s Strategic Autonomy and Competitiveness; risk assessment
and preparedness for water quality breaches and infrastructure vulnerability; National Water Risks Assessment
and Preparedness Plans development.

### 3 Climate Adaptation and Mitigation in the Water Sector


We suggest the inclusion of drought management considerations in water resource planning across Europe; a
holistic flood management approach through digitalization; flood prevention measures development across
sectors like transport, energy, construction, agriculture; including water and sanitation sectors in EU 2040
Climate Targets.

### 4 Digitalization of the Water Sector - an Enabler of Water Resilience for Europe


We call for an EU Action Plan on Digitalization in the Water Sector; dedicated EU funding and incentives for
digital tools deployment; support for the implementation of existing and future EU legislation with digital tools.

### 5 Financing a Transition towards Water Resilient Europe


We need dedicated EU funds for water infrastructure and to support the water needs of EU’s Strategic
Autonomy; more private financing instruments should be unlocked.

### 6 Water Affordability and Access to Water and Sanitation


Energy sector affordability measures at EU level can serve as inspiration for water affordability; yet,
implementing volumetric tariffs based on consumption are key.

## Our views



**Long-term Vision on Water:** A
strategic focus on water quality,
quantity, and accessibility is
crucial for the EU to meet its
2030 and 2050 climate goals
and drive **competitiveness and**
**re-industrialization.**



**Water’s Strategic Role:** Water is a
**vulnerable resource** that is
**essential to the EU's**
**competitiveness, strategic**
**autonomy and economic growth,**
**green and digital transition, and**
**food security.**



**Systematic EU Approach:**
**Coordinated, EU-level approach is**
**needed** to protect infrastructures and
manage water quantitatively and
qualitatively, building readiness to
deliver on broader economic and
sustainability goals.

## Water Efficiency Principle First

We are pleased to see that the European Commission
will put emphasis on the Water Efficiency First principle
to better manage water demand and increase water
reuse and circularity across economic sectors in the EU.


In developing the Principle, key elements should be
considered below. The Principle should be enshrined in
EU law and supporting Guidelines for its implementation
should be developed in line with the existing Energy
Efficiency Principle First [1].


**Reduce water resources consumption**


Water efficiency is closely linked to the **reduction of**
**water utilization by end users.**


**Industrial** : the industrial sector widely is a large
consumer of water e.g. manufacturing, energy,
strategic autonomy (semiconductors, etc.). In order
to optimize the water use of different industrial
sectors, water efficiency measures at the EU level
should be considered that include target in water
utilization index and accompanying standards
tailored to the different sectors. In addition, currently,
it is difficult to make a business case for water
efficiency measures at industrial level because of
existing tariff models across Europe. Currently, in
most countries, a water tariff is cheaper or free when
volumes of use increase so there is neither incentive
nor Return on Investment for water efficiency
measures unless mandated by law. Therefore, we
need to reconsider our tariff models in Europe to
support the Water Efficiency Principle First. France
introduced its National Water Plan with volumetric
tariffs for industry and consumers to support such a
transition.


**Agriculture** : This sector accounts for 28% of water
abstraction[2] in the EU - making it a key sector for
water management. Adopting efficient irrigation (e.g.
drip irrigation) can save over 40% of total water use
in agriculture in Europe, equivalent to 23 billion m³.
The estimated savings are €14 billion through watersmart practices, improved irrigation systems and
reduced energy costs. To support the agriculture
sector with water efficiency measures, we suggest
measures based on the economic output and size of
the farming entity[3] as well as EU funds to support
the transition.


For large agricultural enterprises which are more
likely to have a legal form or be cooperatives:
mandatory water audits and implementation of
water efficiency plans that determine the tailored
efficiency measures to the nature of the business
and local hydrological conditions and
projections.



**Water reuse and circularity**


**Water reuse** : EU Member States have not adopted
water reuse practices widely yet due to a limited
regulatory framework. The EU Water Reuse
Regulation allows for water reuse for irrigation
purposes, but it is not mandatory for Member States.
Therefore, strengthening the regulation to support
the update of water reuse will be critical going
forward. Namely, we recommend mandating water
reuse targets for reclaimed water utilization starting
with agriculture, and industrial applications.


We recommend that EU Member States develop
National Water Reuse Assessment plans and adapt
water reuse response to the local water resource
vulnerability and security, especially around densely
populated areas. Reclamation of treated urban
wastewater is a closed-loop system that can be
protected from external factors, regulated based on



For small and medium-sized farms that are
generally family-run businesses and semisubsistence farms, where the focus is on
growing a high proportion of food to feed
farmers and their families - education programs
that promote sustainable water resource
management practices, irrigation needs based
on crop types, local geological structures, and
resources availabilities.


**Consumers** : Water efficiency will also be improved
through empowering consumers with education in
water utiltization, volumetric tariffs and relevant
data provision.



I.

III.



National and local consumer campaigns will
raise awareness for consumers on the value of
water and how changing behaviors can support a
transition to a more water-efficient and secure
society.


A major game changer for consumers in making
them conscious of their energy consumption
and bills as well as incentivizing them to improve
their energy efficiency was the mandatory
requirement under the EU Energy Efficiency
Directive revision to equip every individual
household with smart energy meters 2012. To
drive efficiency in water use, a similar
requirement should be put in place for smart
water meters installation.In many countries,
individual apartments are not yet metered, thus
preventing awareness about actual water
consumption. Smart, communicating water
meters can facilitate understanding about water
consumption, while providing important data to
the utilities for developing a digital infrastructure.


Based on more accurate data of consumers’
consumption, a fair billing models can be
developed based on volumetric tariffs.

demand, and easily upgraded to serve alternative
uses (such as drinking water in case of emergency).


**Circularity - incentivize new business models:**
These are two additional points that the EU Water
Resilience Strategy should address so that the
economic and governance of the sector are fit for
handling current and future water challenges. EU
policy should incentivize alternative business
models for the water sector. For example, the
revised EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive
included Extended Producer Responsibility scheme
to support with micropollutants treatment costs as
well as requirements for energy neutrality so that
wastewater treatment plants will have to generate
renewable energy. These new measures will
generate investments, and costs that do not fit into
the conventional cashflow cycle of water utilities.
Relaxation of utilities’ financing and procurement
laws can facilitate alternative revenue streams
beside water tariffs and support the new cash flow
requirements. Another example is the recovery of
nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) from wastewater
sludge that can be sold to the agriculture sector or
chemical industries.


**Eliminate water losses**


Another area of water efficiency is eliminating water
losses. Water infrastructure across Europe is old,
and leakage rates average at 24%, rising to 60% in
certain countries/regions. The revised EU Drinking
Water Directive will support with assessing leakages
across EU Member States by 2026. However, to
speed up addressing this problem, the EU can
consider additional requirements for the EU Member
States to address leakages as well as support with
funding.


Digitalization can support the roll-out of the Water
Efficiency Principle First as it is an enabler for all of the
above-mentioned areas.


Last but not least, in order to further enhance water
efficiency through EU legislation, we suggest that it is
included as a metric in legislative impact assessments
as with GHG emissions and climate impact. Practically,
this means that when revising existing EU legislation or
developing new legislation in the relevant sectors
(energy, agriculture, circular economy, industrial, etc.),
the impact on water efficiency and appropriate
measures should be taken into account in specific
legislation on water resilience across areas and
horizontally.


## Develop water resources plan for EU

**Water needs for EU’s Strategic Autonomy and**
**Competitiveness:** Key strategic sectors like
semiconductors production, renewables and
hydrogen, food security, data centres and AI are
highly water intensive. For example, each year the
EU's semiconductor market share grows by 6-8%,
with projected freshwater use for the sector to rise
by 216 million m³, thus worsening water scarcity in
the EU[4]. €2.24 billion will be required by 2030 for
ultrapure water methods for EU’s projected
semiconductor production. Another example is
renewable hydrogen production, which uses 20-30 L
of water per kg of hydrogen and generates 12 L of
wastewater. Usage is expected to triple by 2040,
reaching an annual total of 459 million m³, with 142
million m³ in wastewater[5]. Therefore, the
assessment of the future water needs and resources
of key strategic sectors should be carried out to
ensure that EU’s objectives for the strategic
autonomy and competitiveness are met and that
sufficient water resources will be available to
support the population and these industrial needs.


**Security of water quality and infrastructure**
**vulnerability:** Water resources and infrastructure are
highly exposed to a growing number of external
threats, from climate change to terrorist attacks. It is
essential to assess zones at high risk and build the
system to forecast, prevent and respond to those
threats and efficiently defend continuity of water and
wastewater services. We recommend adapted risk
assessment and preparedness for breaches in water
quality should be included in the water resilience
plan. Based on risk assessment protection, the
systems can include continuous water quality
monitoring, quality breach forecast based on early
detection, early warning systems and emergency
response solutions with alternative drinking water
source. It is also recommended to implement
systems that enable running scenarios, which will
facilitate prioritizing investments based on data and
probabilities.


**National Water Risks Assessment and Preparedness**
**Plans**


**Risk assessment** : In order to ensure sufficient water
resources for Europe’s population and growing
industrial and agriculture needs, EU Member States
should carry out risk assessments based on their
local hydrological situation, and infrastructure
vulnerability to external pressures. Risk analysis and
resilience plans in the water sector should have three
main axes: social, economic and environmental
impacts. These risk assessments should establish
the most adequate alternative source of water to
meet water demands e.g. 1- water reuse, 2 - energy

efficient sea water desalination, etc.


**Risk Preparedness:** In the electricity sector, each
Member State has developed comprehensive
National Risk Preparedness plans[6] based on the
national/local situation and risks to address them
proactively on their path towards energy security.
Development of similar national risk preparedness
and resilience plans for water by each Member State,
following agreed an EU template with key elements
to be addressed, will help countries to manage
current and future water-related risks at national and
local levels and prepare for them accordingly. These
are also important for climate related disasters like
floods, droughts, wildfires, etc. Moreover, these plans
should be closely linked to unlocking more EU funds
for water. For example, when a Member State
delivers timely implementations of the activities in
their national risk preparedness and resilience plans,
more EU funds are provided.

## Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation


In the past four decades, extreme weather events have
caused up to 145 000 human fatalities and half a trillion
euros of economic loss across Europe[7]. With climate
change drastically changing weather patterns, we can
only expect these events to increase in frequency.
According to the EEA report on Climate Risks[8], climate
change is intensifying floods, droughts, and water
quality degradation, posing a growing risk to public
health. From 1980 to 2022, there were 5,582 floodrelated deaths and 702 wildfire-related deaths across
32 European countries. Currently, one in eight
Europeans resides in areas at risk of river floods, and
approximately 30% of people in southern Europe
experience ongoing water stress. Climate change is
expected to exacerbate exposure to extreme weather
events, leading to significant health risks.


Water is at the vector of the climate change impacts,
and as climate change intensifies, it becomes harder to
forecast the occurrence and amplitude of these events.
Immediate action to accelerate implementation and
improve coordination among governments and water
authorities is crucial to building preparedness in
adsorbing the impact of such unplanned events on
water infrastructures and services. Also, adaptation to
climate change cannot be successful without a
committed approach to the mitigation of Greenhouse
Gas Emissions (GHG). For example, with 3°C of global
warming, annual river flood damage in the EU and UK by
2100 is projected to be six times higher than current



levels, reaching €48 billion, with nearly 0.5 million people
exposed to flooding each year—up from 170,000
today[9]. However, limiting global warming to 1.5°C could
cut economic losses in half and reduce the number of
people affected by 230,000.


**The water supply and sanitation sectors account for**
**approximately 2% of GHG emissions globally**, a level
comparable to emissions from aviation. Effectively
monitoring and reducing these emissions will be crucial
for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and meet
its 2040 climate targets. **Including this sector in the**
**upcoming 2040 EU Climate Target would mark a**
**significant step toward a climate-neutral Europe,**
ensuring that water management plays a vital role in the
region’s broader decarbonization efforts.


**Drought management should be considered in water**
**resource planning across Europe** and will benefit from
all water efficiency measures put in place. Future
droughts are expected to occur in geographies currently
rich in water, with fast depletion and degradation of fresh
water sources. For example, coastal zones and islands in
Sweden, considered water-rich country, have suffered
from multi-year seasonal drought in the last 2 decades,
forcing emergency responses including reclamation of
treated wastewater as alternative water source to
drinking water[10].


**Flood management requires a more holistic approach in**
**the future EU Water Resilience Plan** enhancing what is
already required in the EU Floods Directive. Effective
flood management encompasses both flood prevention
and protection against its impacts, including emergency
response preparedness. **Digital transformation across**
**water-related sectors** - such as river basin management,
agriculture, and water utilities - plays a crucial role in
enabling these efforts. Advancements in data
transparency, forecasting capabilities, early warning
systems, and emergency response prioritization are
essential for strengthening resilience.


**Flood prevention should be addressed at a regional**
**scale and integrated horizontally across sectors,** as it is
heavily influenced by river basin management, urban
design, and land use planning. It is recommended that
flood risk assessment be incorporated into the broader
Water Risk Assessment, with an obligation for at-risk
regions to implement prevention measures in their
preparedness plans at both the member state and EU
levels. Additionally, **flood risk considerations should be**
**mandated in the development of horizontal EU**
**Directives**, as evolving sectors such as mobility,
construction, agriculture, and industry significantly
impact water flow, soil absorption, and retention,
ultimately shaping urban vulnerability to flooding.

Protection against flooding impacts requires a localized
approach to mitigate consequences once a flood
occurs. Immediate responses must focus on redirecting
water flows and managing sewer overflows. Urban
water risk assessments should include flood impact
evaluations and ensure preparedness plans contain
measures to limit infrastructure damage, safeguard
affected environments, and address water quality
degradation.

## Digitalization of the water sector: an enabler of Water Resilience for Europe


**Digitalization in the water sector plays a key role**
**towards efficient water management.** Technologies
exist and are ready to be deployed, however, incentives
and EU policy will help the sector to take them on board
and scale them.


Therefore, we recommend that the EU Water Resilience
Strategy includes a dedicated chapter on digitalization
with the following elements:


**EU Action Plan on how to incentivize the**
**deployment of digital solutions in the water sector**
with key proposals, recommendations, best
practices, and knowledge-sharing programs to
accelerate uptake of data-driven innovation across
the entire water value chain at municipal, industrial
and consumer levels, including both engineered and
nature-based infrastructures.


**Set up dedicated EU funding and incentives to**
**support the water sector in its digitalization efforts**,
particularly in the context of discussions on the next
Multiannual Financial Framework. For instance, EU
funding of specific projects could be linked to datacentric deliverables on e.g. water leakage, drinking
water/wastewater management, groundwater
monitoring, or energy efficiency, operating costs,
and asset management of new and existing
infrastructure.


**Accelerate implementation of existing EU water**
**legislation at national level with the support of**
**digitalization.** Knowledge-sharing on how digital
water technologies can support these objectives
should be promoted between and among Member
States, as should capacity building at local, regional,
and national level (e.g. on monitoring and modelling,
interoperability of data formats/standards, leakage
reduction, and energy efficiency).


## Financing a transition towards Water Resilient Europe

**The next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for**
**2027-2033 should include dedicated EU funds for water**
**to support with current and future challenges:**


A total of €255bn will be required by 2030 in the EU
to be invested to comply with the EU Drinking Water,
Urban Wastewater Treatment Directives and to
enhance the efficiency of their water supply systems
[according to socio-economic study commissioned](https://watereurope.eu/water-europe-study-says-e255-billion-investment-needed-by-2030-to-safeguard-europes-economy-and-environment/)
by Water Europe[11]. These estimates include both
Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational
Expenditure (OPEX).


In the next EU MFF, we need cross-cutting funds,
from existing funding streams, to be grouped around
the strategic priority of water, for example similar to
the RePowerEU model. They should be available to
all EU Member States to apply, both to public and
private actors and across sectors not only for
municipalities but also for industry and buildings in
line with the RePowerEU, EU Decarbonization Funds,
etc.


Strategic sectors like renewables and hydrogen,
agriculture, semiconductors and digital economy
have water investment needs for the EU to meet the
set targets in these sectors, Water Europe’s study
demonstrates. For example, the financing gap for
farmers was estimated at €18.9 billion, (30% of the
total financing gap in agriculture) in 2022 and was
primarily attributed to funding needs for irrigation,
drought and flood protection or other investments to
manage changed climate. There is also a huge
investment requirement (€228 billion) to treat a
potential 6 billion m3 of wastewater in the EU and
reduce the dependence of agriculture on freshwater
resources. €2.24 billion will be required by 2030 for
ultrapure water methods for EU’s projected
semiconductor production. Water efficient
electrolysis is a promising solution that could save
189 million m³ of water yearly. The EU funds made
available for strategic sectors as well as the next
MFF, should include funding support for key sectors’
investments in water efficiency, reuse, etc.


Private financing should be further unlocked to
support the transition towards a water-resilient
Europe.

## Water Affordability and Access to Water and Sanitatation

Water is essential to life and hence to remain affordable
for the citizens and protect the vulnerable ones for
public use. The EU Water Resilience Strategy can draw
inspiration from similar approach taken in the energy
sector. The Affordable Energy Action Plan[12] published
as part of the Clean Industrial Deal, provides for EU-wide
actions to support energy remains affordable for
consumers (as well as industries). What is more, Energy
Poverty has been identified as an important action for
the EU and has been addressed in different EU
legislations[13]. All of these areas can serve as
examples for the water sector towards keeping
affordability for the citizens and protecting vulnerable
groups in the transition towards water resilience.


For industries water is a raw material, so it needs to be
priced with the right tariffs. For public, it needs to
remain affordable, yet, volumetric tariffs similar to the
ones included in the Franch National Water Plan, based
on consumption, are important for addressing future
water vulnerabilities.


Access to water and sanitation to all citizens have been
important elements in the EU water legislation –
Drinking Water Directive, Urban Wastewater Directive,
etc. – and the upcoming EU Water Resilience Strategy
should endorse these important elements too.
