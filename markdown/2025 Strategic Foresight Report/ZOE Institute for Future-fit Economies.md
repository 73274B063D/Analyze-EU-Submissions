feedback: 'We welcome the focus on long-term resilience in the 2025 Strategic Foresight
  Report. As the world faces numerous crises, Europe faces both the challenge and
  the opportunity to rethink its approach to building resilient economic and societal
  systems. Resilience and intergenerational fairness are deeply connected as resilience
  is not just bouncing back and overcoming immediate challenges but also bouncing
  forward to ensure future generations inherit stronger, more adaptable systems. Designing
  policies for intergenerational fairness, or intergenerational thinking, ensures
  that todays policy decisions are grounded in a comprehensive understanding of current
  and future trends. To fully use intergenerational thinking in promoting a resilient
  EU, we recommend further embedding strategic foresight in policymaking, utilising
  sustainable and inclusive wellbeing metrics, strengthening citizen participation
  processes, and ensuring horizontal coordination. 1. Strategic foresight: Streamline
  the use of existing and innovative strategic foresight practices of the Commission
  into the policy cycle to support long-term decision-making. These practices can
  feed into the annual work plan, budget, and the work of DGs, with support from the
  JRC. In addition, we invite the Commission to build the muscle, i.e. develop a habit
  of using foresight and strengthen the necessary skills through practice to be able
  to use these resources more efficiently, making them less resource-intensive over
  time. The Commissions Strategic Foresight Network can continue to give guidance
  and support capacity building across various DGs. The Network could cooperate more
  with the Better Regulation Network to share insights and identify synergies. The
  networks could also convene to build capacity among members on how to use strategic
  foresight to improve regulatory quality. 2. Sustainable and inclusive wellbeing
  (SIW) metrics: SIW metrics are centred on measuring progress across three dimensions:
  a. Ensuring future wellbeing (sustainability); encompassing biophysical and social
  conditions for future wellbeing. b. Limiting wellbeing inequalities for current
  and future generations (inclusion); gauging the distribution of wellbeing determinants
  and opportunities across spatial scales and social groups. c. Ensuring current wellbeing
  (wellbeing); determinants such as health, education, air quality, employment, social
  relationships, income, housing, security, and environmental health. A holistic set
  of indicators can enable the EU to assess the long-term sustainability of its strategic
  decisions by integrating different factors. The analytical results stemming from
  these metrics can be used to achieve more targeted and impactful strategic policies.
  3. Citizen engagement: A resilient society can be built by actively engaging citizens
  of all ages in policymaking processes. For example, establishing a regular exchange
  with the Commissions network of youth correspondents or establishing a new coordination
  mechanism with the European Ombudsperson to receive citizen inputs about EU policies
  they believe harm the interests of future generations. Establishing standing citizen
  panels for providing inputs into policies can provide a participatory approach that
  helps build a resilient, inclusive society with stronger policy decisions. 4. Horizontal
  collaboration: Both resilience and intergenerational fairness are cross-cutting
  and require a systemic approach to policy design, implementation and monitoring
  that can help bridge silos. This starts with better integrating environmental, social,
  and economic data from different sectors to ensure more comprehensive analysis.
  This approach supports evidence-informed anticipatory policymaking by helping to
  uncover trade-offs and synergies across policy areas for policy coherence. By embracing
