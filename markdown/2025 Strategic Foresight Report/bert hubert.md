  Abstract: The very short version: it is madness to continue transferring the running
  of European societies and governments to American clouds. Not only is it a terrible
  idea given the kind of things the King of America keeps saying, the legal sophistry
  used to justify such transfers, like the nonsense letter the Dutch cabinet sent
  last week, has now been invalidated by Trump himself. And why are we doing this?
  Convenience. But it is very scary to make yourself 100% dependent on the goodwill
  of the American government merely because it is convenient. So lets not.'

llm_agreements: Both submissions identify dependency on non‑European technology providers
  as a strategic risk and call for policy action to reduce that dependence. They agree
  the EU should strengthen its technological sovereignty, procurement practices, and
  enforcement to protect democratic governance and operational continuity.
llm_disagreements: One submission advances a broad, multi‑sectoral strategy (AI research
  infrastructure, biotech biofoundries, SRM governance, mental‑health policies, and
  enhanced foresight) and prefers measured, research‑led and multilateral approaches;
  the other is narrowly focused and urgent, arguing for immediate operational decoupling
  from US cloud providers on legal and political grounds. The first emphasises capacity‑building,
  institutional design and balanced governance, while the second emphasises immediate,
  pragmatic removal of dependence with a combative tone.
