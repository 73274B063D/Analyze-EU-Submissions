feedback: 'The documents present coordinated feedback from the Spanish semiconductor
  ecosystem for the revision of the Chips Act 2.0. The main message is the need for
  a more operational, flexible, and industry-aligned framework that accelerates design,
  prototyping, manufacturing access, and market deployment. The ecosystem stresses
  that Europe must strengthen the fabless model, which represents most Spanish companies,
  by improving access to open EDA tools, shared tape-outs, certification support,
  and private-public financing instruments. Existing aid schemes are viewed as too
  rigid, slow, and uneven across Member States; the proposal calls for simpler procedures,
  predictable deadlines, direct support to design centers and equipment suppliers,
  and a sovereignty seal to fast-track strategic projects. Talent is described as
  one of the biggest bottlenecks, requiring a European micro-credential system, mobility
  programs, and coordinated training pathways. The documents also insist on better
  alignment between the Chips Act and the Critical Raw Materials Act, recognizing
  gases, chemicals, and equipment suppliers as priority actors. Demand-side incentives
  are considered essential to create scale, especially in automotive, energy, defense,
  telecom, and health. The annex provides sector-specific recommendations: in telecoms,
  advancing RF, chiplets, and 5G/6G SoCs; in defense and space, secure and radiation-resistant
  chips and flexible Lab-to-Fab prototyping; in AI hardware, promoting RISC-V, neuromorphic
  systems, open design, and green chips; in photonics, positioning it as a strategic
  enabling technology with shared pilot lines; in materials, boosting European production
  of chemicals, 2D materials, and equipment, and promoting circularity; in automotive,
  validating EU-made chips and integrating European sensors; and in energy, supporting
  SiC/GaN, efficient power conversion chips, and greener manufacturing. Overall, the
  feedback emphasizes practical mechanisms, stronger governance with industry participation,
  and the need to turn strategic priorities into concrete, enforceable operational
  tools.'

# **Joint proposal from the Spanish** **semiconductor ecosystem for the** **public participation process of** **the European Chips Act 2.0**

### **About AESEMI**


AESEMI is the **Spanish Semiconductor Industry Association**, an organization that
represents Spanish entities engaged in microelectronic design and semiconductor
manufacturing.


The Association was founded at the end of 2021, motivated by the great need to
provide the sector with its own entity that would channel the voice of the industry
in a context in which semiconductors have become a strategic asset on which
industries that are fundamental to the European Union depend. Today, AESEMI has
**more than 110 members**, including those entities that have begun the membership
process, among which are companies of many different types, universities from all
over the country, and R&D centers.


The aim of our association is **to raise the profile of all entities that form part of**
**the technological ecosystem of semiconductors, microelectronics, and related**
**technologies in Spain** .

### **About the Chips Act proposals**


**1. Introduction and context**


This document is the result of collaboration between organizations representing
different parts of the Spanish semiconductor and associated technologies
ecosystem, such as **VaSiC, AESEMI, AMETIC, ADIGITAL, and COIT**, together with
universities, research centers, and companies in the Spanish semiconductor
ecosystem. During 2025, **these entities** have worked in a coordinated manner to
define a common strategic position in response to the public consultation on the
European Chips Act 2.0, with the aim of contributing to the revision of the European
regulatory and financial framework that will guide microelectronics policy in the

coming years.


The text **harmonizes the complementary views** of business associations and
technology institutions. This proposal reflects a pluralistic, structured, and realistic


vision that is representative of the capabilities and ambitions of the Spanish
ecosystem within the European context.


The European Chips Act 2.0 is not a mere continuation of the previous framework:
it represents a strategic redefinition that seeks to balance technological leadership,
industrial sovereignty, and the sustainability of the European semiconductor
ecosystem. Thanks to public-private collaboration and the coordination of key
players, Spain can play a significant role in the development of design, R&D,
production, packaging, and talent training capabilities.


**2. Objectives of the proposal**


The overall objective of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the
Spanish ecosystem that complements the European industrial perspective and
helps to consolidate a coherent, efficient operational framework adapted to the
sector's actual capabilities. To this end, the following strategic objectives are
proposed:


1. **Strengthen Europe's global competitiveness** by balancing design,

manufacturing, and advanced materials capabilities, prioritizing excellence in

R&D and support for technology-based companies.


2. **Recognize the strategic value of the European fabless model**, placing

design and intellectual property (IP) as central pillars of the ecosystem's

growth. This model, which predominates in Spain with more than 80% of

companies in the sector, represents a structural advantage that must be

enhanced through specific financial and regulatory instruments.


3. **Promote training, mobility, and specialization of talent** through a

European micro-credential framework, the expansion of dual training

programs, and the creation of continuous learning pathways between

vocational training, universities, and industry.


4. **Align financing mechanisms and public aid** with the actual timescales of

technological development, promoting flexible, predictable, and coordinated

structures among Member States, reviewing state aid regulations where

necessary.


5. **Boost private investment** by creating a European guarantee mechanism

that reduces the risk of advanced innovation projects and encourages cross
border cooperation.


6. **Balance supply and demand policies** by introducing incentives that favor

the adoption of European chips in key sectors such as automotive, energy,


defense, health, and telecommunications, and by introducing mechanisms

to ensure optimal levels of service provision in these sectors.


7. **Strengthen the participatory governance** of the Chips Act 2.0 by

integrating industry associations and clusters into decision-making bodies,

ensuring balanced and transparent representation.


8. **Consolidate Spain's position as a hub for European innovation and**

**cooperation**, leveraging the coordination capacity between technology

centers, companies, and public administrations.


9. **Convert strategic priorities into operational instruments** : define

measures and criteria that can be regulated at the European level (legal

definition of Open EU Foundry, mandate for Chips JU on EDA/OpenTapeout,

rules for a European Guarantee Facility, etc.) with deadlines, tangible

objectives, and public responsibilities.


10. **Ensure the security, sustainability**, **and resilience of the supply of**

**strategic raw materials** through coordinated policies that provide secure

sources, processing capacities, and recycling processes that reduce external

dependence and support European industrialization.


**3. Main recommendations**


**3.1. Start-up & Scale-up – From innovation to market**


The European semiconductor ecosystem faces the challenge of transforming
research into sustainable commercial results. In this context, the fabless model has
become a driver of competitiveness that must be supported by specific business
scaling policies. This section addresses how the Chips Act 2.0 can serve as a catalyst
for technological entrepreneurship, driving the transition from innovation to the
market.


Europe has a growing network of technology design and service companies that can
compete globally if they have access to design tools, patient capital, and support
during growth stages. Strengthening this segment is essential to reducing external
dependence and ensuring technological sovereignty.


The ability of companies to scale up depends not only on their technological
capabilities, but also on the existence of a balanced support framework. To date, the
distribution of support instruments has not been uniform, limiting the ability of
many SMEs and start-ups to access crucial financing in the early stages. It is essential
to correct these inequalities so that all companies with growth potential have the
necessary resources to compete and expand.


Likewise, aid for fabless companies must be designed with sufficient flexibility to
adapt to the real needs of each project. Not all companies require the same tools or
investments, so it is necessary to promote aid that allows companies to invest in
operating and capital expenditures with the greatest possible cross-cutting
approach.


**Recommendations:**


  - Introduce specific incentives for the fabless model, facilitating access to open

EDA tools and shared tape-out services.


  - Create a European Go-to-Market budget to cover marketing, certification,

and pilot testing costs.


  - Establish a framework of growth incentives that prevents the loss of aid or

tax advantages when companies scale up.


  - Strengthen access to private financing through a European Guarantee Facility

for Semiconductors, which mitigates investment risk and complements

public support.


  - Simplify guarantees and promote mutual guarantee companies.


  - Coordinate the granting processes between the Commission and the

Member States.


**3.2. Talent, training, and microcredentials**


European competitiveness in semiconductors does not depend solely on
infrastructure or funding, but fundamentally on talent. The shortage of
professionals specializing in microelectronics, chip design, advanced optics,
materials, and photonics represents one of the main bottlenecks in the European
ecosystem. In Spain, the growth of research centers, startups, and industrial plants
has increased the demand for engineers, technicians, and technology management
profiles, creating the need for a coordinated strategy at the European level.


Training and mobility are essential elements, but they must be accompanied by
effective talent retention policies. The reality is that, both in Spain and in Europe as
a whole, a significant proportion of highly qualified engineers and professional s
trained in fields such as microelectronics end up pursuing their careers in third
countries. To prevent this brain drain, it is essential to generate professional
opportunities within the ecosystem itself, strengthening the capacity of companies
to offer attractive projects and competitive career paths.


**Recommendations:**


  - Strengthen existing programs such as Chip Chairs (a national call for

proposals launched in 2023 in Spain as part of the PERTE Chip program) and

expand them at the European level.


  - Develop a European micro-credential framework that recognizes skills in

microelectronics and design, promoting labor mobility and transnational

cooperation.


  - Create modular training pathways that integrate vocational training,

university education, and continuing education at the European level.


  - Facilitate the attraction of global talent through flexible visas and mutual

recognition of qualifications.


  - Encourage internal mobility in Europe through scholarships and long-term

cross-sector internship programs.


  - Expand collaboration with geographical regions in Latin America that have

public commitments similar to those of the European Union.


**3.3. State aid and regulatory framework**


The revision of the Chips Act must resolve the lack of consistency between European
financing instruments and national frameworks. The experience of the first Chips
Act revealed bureaucratic limitations, a lack of flexibility, and slowness in the
execution of funds. A flexible regulatory framework, adapted to the nature of the
sector, is essential for Europe to compete with the large state support programs in
the US and Asia.


The new regulatory design should ensure balanced competitiveness between
Member States, allow for state aid tailored to the size and maturity of companies,
facilitate reviews of the scope and objectives of authorized aid, establish maximum
deadlines for resolving aid granting processes, and encourage private investment
without distorting the market. In addition, better coordination between the
Commission, national governments, and innovation agencies is crucial.


State aid must be designed in such a way that it does not distort competition or
concentrate resources in a small number of players. It is advisable to establish
control mechanisms to monitor the total volume of public aid received by each
beneficiary, thus ensuring more balanced access to support instruments.


Similarly, given the complexity of projects in this field, it would be beneficial to
enable open-ended calls for research and development activities, allowing entities
to submit individual projects without the obligation to form consortia when this is
not necessary. Furthermore, consideration should be given to establishing
continuous submission systems or increasing the number of annual calls for


proposals, in order to avoid funding opportunities being limited to very narrow time
frames.


**Recommendations:**


  - Create a specific regulatory framework for the semiconductor sector, with

rules that differ from those of other industrial sectors and favor investment

and R&D.


  - Facilitate adaptation to market dynamics with maximum deadlines for the

authorization of aid by the European Commission and agile mechanisms for

reviewing the scope and objectives of authorizations granted.


  - Introduce calls for proposals with open time frames for the submission of

particularly complex projects.


  - Allow direct aid to design centers, equipment suppliers, and laboratories.


  - Introduce a "sovereignty seal" to facilitate rapid access to national and

European funding.


  - Avoid administrative duplication and extend the deadlines for the execution

of funds.


  - Improve interministerial coordination in the implementation of national

programs derived from the Chips Act.


  - Establish a requirement, at the national level and coordinated by the

Commission, to map the availability and supply chains of strategic raw

materials for semiconductors, including mining, chemical processes, and gas

and resin suppliers.


  - Explicitly integrate the priorities of the Chips Act 2.0 with the framework of

the _Critical Raw Materials Act_ to align investment priorities.


  - Recognize suppliers of equipment, gases, chemicals, and metrology as

priority beneficiaries in calls for proposals and support programs, allowing

their direct participation in consortia and funding lines.


**3.4. European Competitiveness Fund (ECF), Partnership Plans, and Private**
**Capital**


Access to financing is one of the biggest challenges for European technology
companies. Although public funds are necessary, they are not sufficient: a financial
structure is needed to mobilize private capital and enable the financing of high-risk
technology projects. The European Competitiveness Fund (ECF) should act as a lever
for mixed investment, promoting pan-European projects and strengthening local
value chains. However, the ECF should not be the only source of EU budget support


for the microelectronics sector; National and Regional Partnership Plans should
include a digital sovereignty objective similar to the digital investment objective
included in the MRR.


Europe also needs guarantee instruments comparable to those of other
international programs, which facilitate the entry of institutional investors and
reduce barriers to access for startups and SMEs.


The European Competitiveness Fund must explicitly guarantee access for innovative
SMEs, which are the most vulnerable and, at the same time, the most strategic link
in the ecosystem. These companies often lack the financial resources necessary to
undertake critical investments in design, prototyping, or scaling, while public
organizations already have specific financing mechanisms in place. Ensuring nondiscriminatory access tailored to the needs of SMEs will be essential to diversifying
the European industrial base.


**Recommendations:**


  - Establish a European guarantee mechanism to reduce the risk of private

investment in semiconductors.


  - Replace one-off funds with structured financing based on milestones and

results.


  - Include a target of 20% investment in digital sovereignty in National and

Regional Partnership Plans financed by the EU budget.


  - Promote a European Single Capital Market that allows cross-border

investments in semiconductors.


  - Maintain subsidies as the main tool for SMEs and technology centers.


  - Include monitoring mechanisms to assess the social and technological

impact of funded projects.


  - Create instruments within the ECF to finance projects for the transformation

and processing of strategic raw materials with conditions adapted to CAPEX
intensive and long-term horizons.


  - Promote mechanisms to encourage the flow of capital towards investment

vehicles in strategic technologies in different formats (corporate venturing,

venture capital, etc.).


**3.5. Industrial associations, governance, and coordination**


The success of the Chips Act 2.0 will depend on the ability to coordinate between
different levels of governance. The active inclusion of associations, clusters, and
regional networks will ensure the consistency and representativeness of the


implementation process. The role of these entities should not be limited to
consultation, but should be incorporated as a structural part of decision-making.


Furthermore, European industrial diversity requires flexible governance that
combines a common strategic vision with adaptation to national and regional
realities. In Spain, the collaboration between all **the actors that make up this**
**document** demonstrates the value of cooperative models.


**Recommendations:**


  - Integrate sector associations into the Chips Joint Undertaking (Chips JU) and

the European Semiconductor Regions Alliance (ESRA), also including national

industry associations that bring together demand sectors.


  - Create a European Committee of Semiconductor Industry Associations to

channel joint positions to the Commission.


  - Replicate inclusive governance models in Member States and enable stable

operational funding for associations and clusters.


  - Strengthen interregional cooperation through national platforms and

European innovation networks.


  - Implement specific funding mechanisms and incentives for sectoral

associations in the different Member States.


**3.6. Incentives for demand and driving sectors**


The Chips Act 2.0 must go beyond supporting supply to become a driver of
transformation for the entire European economy. The adoption of European chips
in key industrial sectors will consolidate technological sovereignty, reduce external
dependencies, and create sustainable economies of scale.


Sectors such as automotive, energy, defense, telecommunications, and healthcare
can act as technological drivers, boosting demand and strengthening the internal
market. Incentives should stimulate both innovative public procurement and
strategic alliances between manufacturers and users.


**Recommendations:**


  - Create incentive programs for the adoption of European chips in automotive,

energy, defense, healthcare, and Industry 4.0.


  - Promote co-development programs between chip suppliers and industrial

users, with the ambition of meeting self-sufficiency targets in the supply

chain.


  - Strengthen the competitiveness of European ancillary industries (chemicals,

materials, metrology).


  - Promote innovative public procurement and "first customer" strategies that

accelerate the adoption of European solutions.


**3.7. Strategic challenges and opportunities**


The current geopolitical context and global competition in frontier technologies call
for a more ambitious and cohesive European strategy. The Chips Act 2.0 should
focus on areas where Europe can differentiate itself, maximizing its industrial and
technological impact.


Integrated photonics, AI hardware, advanced materials, and energy efficiency are
fields where Spain already excels and can contribute significantly to European
leadership. This section identifies priority opportunities to turn public investment
into a driver of strategic autonomy.


**Priorities:**


  - Promote integrated photonics and edge AI as areas of strategic

specialization.


  - Strengthen the role of RISC-V, open design, and sustainable AI hardware.


  - Support the development of critical materials and processing equipment to

reduce dependencies.


  - Consolidate international cooperation with partners such as Japan, South

Korea, Latin America, and the US in advanced R&D.


  - Prioritize investments in More-than-Moore / mature nodes (RF, analog,

power, FD-SOI).


  - Ensure a sustainable supply chain, develop capabilities in

gases/resins/equipment, promote circularity, and establish

forecasting/strategic reserve systems, substitution research, and

international supply agreements.


**4. Conclusions**


This proposal consolidates the position of the Spanish semiconductor ecosystem as
a strategic ally in building a more competitive and technologically sovereign Europe.
In Spain, coordination **between all participating organizations, representing the**
**Spanish semiconductor ecosystem as broadly as possible,** reflects the maturity
of the sector and its willingness to collaborate in defining and implementing an
operational Chips Act 2.0.


In particular, we emphasize the need for the new framework not to be limited to
generic objectives, but to include definitions and operational mechanisms that


enable the rapid and secure deployment of industrial capabilities. Immediate
priorities include: measures to ensure access to design and prototyping, the
consolidation of industrial capabilities accessible to the design community, financial
instruments to mobilize private capital, and explicit measures to guarantee security
of supply and strengthen the auxiliary and raw materials chain.


We reinforce the call for inclusive governance that incorporates industrial
associations and technical centers in the design and monitoring of instruments, as
well as the creation of impact indicators and the execution of operational pilots that
validate the proposed models before their deployment at scale.


The participating entities reiterate their commitment to actively participate in the
technical and legal drafting processes, working groups, and pilot initiatives
necessary for the Chips Act 2.0 to translate into real industrial capabilities, skilled
employment, and strategic resilience for Europe.
