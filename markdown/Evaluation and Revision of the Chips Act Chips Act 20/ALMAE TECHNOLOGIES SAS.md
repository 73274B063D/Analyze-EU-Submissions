feedback: Almae Technologies is a fast-scaling IDM company operating in the semiconductor
  value chain located in France. Almae management is very experienced in the field
  with a technical background coming from Alcatel and Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs. Our
  product range covers transceivers chips (discrete and integrated lasers) for Telecom
  and Datacom networks with state-of-the-art performances compared to market leader
  Lumentum products. Almae has already captured about 10% of the Telecom products
  (at chip level) market share worldwide, thanks to partnership with Chinese integrators,
  and is actively engaged with E.S.TEL from Belgium to build an alternative European
  supply chain. Our technology differentiation is based on a deep understanding of
  III-V structure design and material growth, Epitaxy being key for Photonics as Lithography
  is for EICs. These differentiating factors will give Almae a strong position is
  the next generation of transceiver chips which will rely on InP integration on SOI
  wafers to enhance Silicon with various photonic functions. Integration of InP on
  Silicon in the form of chiplets will play a key role in future interconnect technology
  for Artificial Intellignece. Almae is a key member of Chips-JU project Starlight
  and is in partnership with innovators worldwide. In addition, we strongly believe,
  together with ST CEO J-M Chery, in a necessary end-to-end control of the supply-chain.
  In our case, high-volume Epitaxy know-how and equipment, as well as Indium Phosphide
  wafers manufacturing and recycling, are critical control points for the future.
  We strongly believe that InP technology along with InP integration with Si-Photonics,
  hybrid integration, and CMOS-Photonics, wafer level monolithic integration, will
  give Europe a unique and clear chance to regain a leading position in the connectivity
  market space, especially for AI and HPC clusters, as well as create new opportunities
  in the consumer market space. The time has come for a shift in ambition to set in
  place a First-of-a-Kind facility giving Almae and partners the opportunity to scale
  business and lead the market. The initiative should be clearly market oriented and
  industrially driven with support from RTOs to prepare an aligned roadmap. For now,
  we have seen the reverse strategy which is pushing the market introduction to far
  in time. In this respect, a targeted amendment to the Chips Act, bringing forward
  the strategic nature of the initiative would be preferable. Scale of the manufacturing
  facility to be built should be targeted to take over at least 1/3 of the worldwide
  market at stake, well above the EU needs to build a leadership position for Europe.
  Such a project is reasonable and doable considering the existing skills and an estimated
  overall budget of less the 1 B over 2026-2030, to be compared to the investment
  level needed to catch-up for advanced semiconductor nodes.
