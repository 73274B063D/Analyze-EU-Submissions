feedback: Speaking as an advanced package design industry expert and also an NGO representative,
  my belief is EU should also solidify the recent accomplishments of CA1 to support
  a collaborative learning ecosystem for chip and package design and manufacturing
  to ensure we have the needed workforce to support domestic semiconductor industry
  growth. We are severely lacking experts, and most of our curricula is either obsolete
  or developed in silos - good innitiatives may not get the necessary exporure in
  order to help others pick up the pace. My vision is a CA2 backed EU learning platform,
  that is open to various levels of education (pre-batchlor, batchlor, MS, PDH levels)
  where all participating countries can contribute and align towards. A well funded
  project could attract industry consultants, motivate academia, leverage the foundries
  and pilot lines we already built in CA1, attract EDA partners and first and foremost
  provide an attractive and flexible learning environment for our young emerging talents.
  We can also use this project to leverage what some academia centers are doing well,
  and allow some other centers to catch up and start contributing as well on the long
  run, with both know how and human resources. We are in a good spot with the accomplishments
  in Act1, and my strong belief is consolidation is key for Act2, for both industry's
  present and academic future.
