feedback: 'ASP Equipment GmbH is a medium sized OEM, we develop and manufacture power
  supplies for satellites and other spacecraft. We are the national leading supplier
  for Power Electronics for Spacecraft and Launchers. In some areas, we heavily depend
  on very few, sometimes single sources for materials and EEE parts which cannot be
  procured from the European continent. For use in space, both electronical components
  and materials must withstand extreme temperatures, X-radiation and straying ions.
  This requires not only a very specialized design, but as well extremely resilient
  and mechanically robust semiconductors. Very recently, the European countries agreed
  on considerable budget increases for the space industry. Furthermore, national space
  budgets for defence continue to rise significantly every year. Although we operate
  in a niche market, it is growing steadily and has now reached a considerable volume.
  A significant proportion of this volume goes to manufacturers of electronic components.
  Ancient components are often used because there are no modern alternatives. The
  Chips Act 2 must encourage companies with its initiatives to develop alternative
  and innovative products for our large niche to create independence. Smaller companies
  and start-ups in particular need support, as the rules are complicated and qualifications
  require long term investments. Furthermore, it is important to keep the big picture
  in mind: a component is only functional in an assembled printed circuit board. We
  must ensure that the European PCB industry will not slip into insignificance.'
