**Statement - Request for consultation of the Directorate General for Communications**
**Networks, Content and Technology / Unit C3 “Microelectronics and Photonics”**
**regarding the review of the Chips Act (Chips Act 2)**

AUMOVIO SE welcomes the opportunity to respond to the European Commission’s Public
Consultation and Call for Evidence for the Review of the Chips Act (Chips Act 2). The
revision of the EU Chips Act presents an important opportunity for the European
Commission and its Member States to strengthen both semiconductor supply chains in
Europe and globally.

AUMOVIO continues the business of the former Continental group sector Automotive
(including the Contract Manufacturing division) as an independent company with after its
spin-off in September 2025. The technology and electronics company offers a wide-ranging
portfolio that makes mobility safe, exciting, connected, and autonomous. This includes
sensor solutions, displays, braking, and comfort systems, as well as comprehensive expertise
in software, architecture platforms, and assistance systems for software-defined vehicles. In
the fiscal year 2024, the business areas which now belong to AUMOVIO generated sales of
19.6 billion Euro. The company is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany and has over 86,000
employees in more than 100 locations worldwide.

**Key Points regarding the review of the Chips Act (Chips Act 2):**

  - A comprehensive EU semiconductor strategy has to pave the way to support holistic
semiconductor ecosystem development and support upstream supply chain
components like fabless business models, design, packaging, and test. This avoids
ecosystem fragmentation and strengthens supply chain security. In order to stabilize
and widen the ecosystem in EU, also the Integrated Circuits (IC) design for standard
IC and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) need to be supported

  - Chips JU initiative needs simplified and accelerated funding and permitting
processes for SMEs, startups, and industrial users engaging in chip design and pilot
production. Fast-tracking support helps the company scale chip development and
prototype production efficiently in emerging technologies

  - Expand and support focus on innovative legacy and specialized chips in the
initiative. Maintain support for legacy, specialized sector specific chips (e.g.
automotive) alongside advanced AI and quantum chips and match realities where
long product lifecycles and reliability standards prevail

  - Prioritize demanding and essential EU sectors (e.g. automotive, robotics, industrials)
with attractive funding schemes for resilience

  - Promote chip design and advanced / next-gen packaging for complex vehicle
architectures and open chiplet-ecosystem. Position – through the Chips JU initiative

    - Europe as a leader in innovative packaging methods, fostering an ecosystem for
advanced packaging and modular chiplet technologies that enhance performance,
reliability, and cost efficiency. Also, the activities relating to software defined
vehicles (SDV) are highly connected with the early stages of chip design

  - Improve stronger collaboration between research centers and industry. Link
semiconductor research hubs, pilot lines, and industrial developers (e.g. automotive
suppliers) to enable rapid technology transfer and real-world validation of designed
chips

  - Investments in education and talent retention are essential and fundamental for the
ecosystem and to its long-term competitiveness. A strong talent base in chip design,
packaging, and attract, train, and retain semiconductor experts are fundamental and
relevant to important EU industry sectors (e.g. automotive / smart mobility sector)

**Pillar I – The “Chips for Europe” Initiative**




  - Pillar I offers strong research capabilities but lacks support for industrial-scale
deployment for important European industries (e.g. automotive sector)

  - No clear pipeline exists between Pillar I developments and future European
manufacturing; a strong industry involvement is an essential element for bridging
the gap between innovation and the market / future series deployment

  - Pillar I must convert and reflect research into producible technologies and meet
downstream industry needs (especially automotive) for innovations and value
creation

  - Chips Act 2 and its R&D arm should focus on end-user requirements - Goal: Ensure
future capacity and address imbalance between high automotive demand and
limited regional production, using collaborative R&I projects as main approach to
join forces between research and industry

**Pillar II – Security of supply and resilience**




  - Pillar II focuses mainly on frontend fabs; backend investments remain limited,
creating critical capacity gaps; a support of partnerships along the whole
semiconductor value chain is recommended

  - OPEX support for backend (packaging, testing, assembly) is essential for industrialscale deployment and meeting automotive demand

  - State aid rules should allow targeted OPEX support while ensuring efficient funding.

  - Structural issues—high energy costs, bureaucracy, permitting delays, skill
shortages—must be addressed to make Europe competitive

  - Investments should strengthen the entire automotive semiconductor ecosystem; EUlevel coordination is key to avoid fragmentation

  - Design/fabless activities and firms as well as upstream suppliers must be integrated
into the security-of-supply framework, including eligibility of design centers

  - Production facility incentives should align with market needs and full value-chain
integration (e.g. maintain also a holistic AI approach and adaption for the industries)

**Pillar III – Monitoring and crisis response**




- Pillar III focuses on monitoring and crisis response but is reactive and limited to
semiconductor supply data

- Current tools rely on static databases with limited ability ability to anticipate
geopolitical risks, export controls, and disruptions

- Automotive sector vulnerabilities and end-user integration are insufficiently
addressed

- Need of shift to proactive, continuous dialogue between industry and the
Commission, based on real-time monitoring of geopolitical risks, logistics, and

bottlenecks; involve the whole semiconductor ecosystem to better anticipate future
crises, but streamline information compilation and clear governance throughout
Europe

  - Establish clear early-warning indicators for critical components and geopolitical
triggers

  - Ensure EU-level coordination to avoid fragmented national responses

  - Crisis preparedness must include industrialisation and market uptake bottlenecks,
not just raw supply constraints

**Finale:**

  - Securing the semiconductor ecosystem and market requires a strong, targeted, and
less bureaucratic framework for key industries like automotive and semiconductors

  - Such a framework should drive innovation, support advanced research, and enable
next-generation chip design and development while attracting investment and
strengthening the value chain, including shorten the time-to-state / European aid

  - Furthermore, long-term access to strategic raw materials and intermediate products
must be ensured
