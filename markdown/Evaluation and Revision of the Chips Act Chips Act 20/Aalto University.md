feedback: Thank you for providing the opportunity for the feedback. I believe it is
  a good moment to rethink the role of chip design. I feel Europes chip design capabilities
  have received comparatively less attention. As we look ahead, the next phase of
  the Chips Act could benefit from a stronger focus on design competitiveness. This
  perspective is also in line with the European Commissions recent statements on September
  29.
