feedback: 'The feedforward for the upcoming revision of the CHIPS Act is articulated
  in 7 policy focus points, to be linked to the European Semiconductors Regions Alliance
  paper, attached, which was adopted by the ESRA political network in July 2025. Insofar
  as possible, policies designed should identify how to best make use of the regional
  dimension as a multiplier and a facilitator of european level policies, leveraging
  the capillarity and close connection to regional stakeholders and "small"/"smaller"
  actors, thereby bringing into view a holistic integration of the whole European
  value chain and overcome geographical, policy and financing fragmentation. 1. Strengthen
  Pre-Commercial Procurement with Regional Integration: - Advocate for EU-level mechanisms
  that prioritize innovative public procurement to accelerate adoption of European
  semiconductor technologies. - Link procurement to regional specializations by mapping
  technologies developed in EU territories that can serve strategic projects (e.g.,
  AI giga-factories, critical infrastructures). - Foster, even at the risk of hindering
  or slowing pan-European deployment, conditionality in public procurement: introduce
  or reinforce minimum thresholds for EU-origin technology to stimulate demand for
  European SMEs and startups. 2. Reinforce the Entire Semiconductor Value Chain: -
  Support industrial segments beyond chip manufacturing, including equipment suppliers
  and technology adopters (AI, automotive, quantum, photonics). - Develop financial
  instruments to help user industries absorb higher costs of EU technologies compared
  to non-EU competitors. - Promote lab-to-fab strategies for technology transfer,
  ensuring R&D results scale to industrial deployment. 3. Enable Interregional Cooperation
  and Extended Value Chains: - Create a European Competence Map to identify complementarities
  across regional ecosystems. - Incentivize cross-regional clusters and partnerships
  to reduce competition and foster joint projects. - Recognize extended value chains
  in funding criteria (e.g., clusters in neighboring regions should be favored in
  large-scale investments). 4. Align and Combine Funding Streams: - Establish mechanisms
  to blend EU, national, and regional funds for strategic projects that cannot rely
  solely on IPCEI or Chips JU. - Avoid over-dependence on Member State budgets for
  transformative projects; ensure direct EU contributions for ecosystem-building initiatives.
  5. Develop Talent and Mobility Incentives: - Introduce joint training programs with
  special conditions for semiconductor sectors to make them more attractive. - Promote
  intra-EU mobility schemes for skilled workers, enabling regions with strong academic
  capacity to benefit from workforce circulation. - Offer incentives for companies
  participating in collaborative training and reskilling programs. 6. Integrate Semiconductor
  Policy with Complementary Tech Strategies: - Ensure legislative coherence between
  semiconductor policies and those for AI, quantum, photonics, and automotive, given
  their interdependence. 7. Accelerate Technology Transfer: - Implement a robust technology
  transfer policy to move innovations from lab to fab, beyond pilot lines. - Support
  industrial-scale deployment through targeted, diversified funding and regulatory
  facilitation.'

# **Shaping Europe’s Semiconductor Future: Regional** **Strengths for Global Positioning**

_Position Paper of the European Semiconductor Regions Alliance (ESRA)_

_on the revision of the EU Chips Act and_
_the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)_


Semiconductors are the driving force behind modern economies and are also essential for Europe’s security
and defense, ensuring strategic autonomy and resilience in critical technologies. Additionally, they play a
central role in the EU's Green Transition by enabling several key sectors that are vital for reducing carbon
footprints and meeting emissions reduction targets.


The European Chips Act has already been instrumental in addressing supply shortages and promoting
technological sovereignty by channelling strategic investments across Europe. The publication of the Draghi
Report and the EU’s Competitiveness Compass has ignited renewed debate over revising the Chips Act,
particularly in conjunction with the forthcoming Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). In anticipation of
these revisions, ESRA presents this Position Paper to advocate for a place-based strategy that leverages the
unique strengths of the EU’s regions.


To build a thriving European semiconductor industry, the EU must support the development and stimulate
interconnections of regional ecosystems. Regions play a crucial role in developing regional innovative
semiconductor ecosystems by enabling research, innovation and industrial investments. They foster
specialized talent, research infrastructures, and collaborations across industry, knowledge institutions, and
government.


The European Semiconductor Regions Alliance (ESRA) is a coalition of European regions with established
semiconductor ecosystems encompassing industry, research institutions, and innovation hubs. Since adopting
its first Position Paper, _Strengthen the Semiconductor Ecosystem in Europe_ (2024), ESRA has dedicated itself
to enhancing the sector’s growth and competitiveness, actively contributing to achieving the goals set by the
European Commission of strengthening Europe’s global standing in semiconductor technology


This Position Paper calls for the strategic recognition of semiconductors within the 2028-2034 MFF,
emphasizing the pivotal role of regions in shaping a strong EU semiconductor ecosystem. It proposes
actionable recommendations to contribute to EU policies under the following key areas (detailed on the
following pages):


**1.** **Enhancing Regional Ecosystems:** Boost inter-regional collaboration; align EU funding with

regional strengths and facilitate SMEs’ and startups’ access; strengthen regional clusters to drive
innovation; improve IPCEI’s through direct EU funding, faster approval process, coordination
with regional/local ecosystems; Consult ESRA in the definition of ECS-SRIA.

**2.** **Strengthening the Semiconductor Value Chain** : Invest in EU key industry segments and connect

regional specializations to foster a resilient value chain, reduce dependencies and enhance
competitiveness; expand R&D and testing infrastructures; ensure semiconductor innovation and
manufacturing remains in the EU; Revise the "first of a kind" criterion to enhance resilience.


**3.** **Developing Skills, Talent, and Workforce** : Address the semiconductor skills gap through STEM

awareness initiatives; increase cross-border training programs; attract global talent with mobility
incentives, streamlined entry requirements, and faster processing; standardize industry
certifications.

## **1. Enhancing Regional Ecosystems**

Semiconductor development thrives on proximity, where co-located firms, research institutions, and supply
chain partners create synergies that amplify innovation and production efficiency. The scaling effect highlights
the significant advantage of connecting region-based strategies, which leverage synergies, reduce logistical
inefficiencies along value chains, and accelerate knowledge transfer through the cluster networks.
Furthermore, localizing semiconductor design and manufacturing is critical to the long-term economic
resilience of the whole of the EU. Regions’ capacity to drive local ecosystems is key to help address value
chain bottlenecks. They can also mobilize existing expertise in areas that are not semiconductor-specific, like
sensor technology, emerging technologies (photonics/quantum/AI), automotive applications and
automation, to strengthen the semiconductor value chain further. The EU must therefore allocate funding to
support cutting-edge innovations in the semiconductor industry—extending beyond silicon-based
technologies—to establish global leadership in emerging technological applications. By fostering leading
innovation and producing high-quality technology along the complex high-tech value chain, Regions can help
shape the EU’s value proposition as a premier environment for investment, making it more attractive to
international players. To build a thriving European semiconductor ecosystem, Europe must support the
development and interconnections of regional ecosystems, as they form its core foundation.


ESRA calls for:


 - **Advancing and Connecting Regional Innovation Ecosystems** : The revised EU Semiconductor Strategy
should adopt a place-based innovation ecosystem approach and allocate funding to targeted
collaborative projects, as well as to the creation of interregional networks that foster knowledge
sharing, development and production partnerships, research-industry collaboration, and technology
transfer infrastructures. The 2028-2034 MFF should earmark funding for the EU’s semiconductor
industry by establishing a dedicated budget section. This coordinated approach will: foster resource
sharing and competence recirculation; facilitate joint project identification; strengthen regional and
European ecosystems and fully integrate SMEs and startups; address gaps in the semiconductor value
chain while increasing Europe's attractiveness for foreign investment.

 - **Enhancing IPCEIs and Regional Involvement:** IPCEIs (Important Projects of Common European Interest)
play a key role in deploying major semiconductor investments and must be further enhanced. To
achieve this, Regions encourage the introduction of certain improvements: 1. speed up the approval
process in order to keep pace with rapid technological evolution that characterizes the semiconductor
industry; 2. consultation of regions as key stakeholders, enhancing their role especially in facilitating
implementation and maximising benefits of IPCEIs investments; 3. integrate direct EU funding to
national allocations and increase transparency, coordination and alignment all along the process; 4.
establish a mechanism that encourage the integration of regional/local supply chains in IPCEIs
investments to maximize their impact on regional ecosystems.

 - **Recognizing the Role of Regions in ECS-SRIA** : With their intermediate dimension, regions are best
placed both to implement the EU and national policies and to contribute to their definition. As such,
ESRA can play an advisory role in defining the European Chips Strategic Research and Innovation
Agenda (ECS-SRIA), by incorporating expertise through insights from the regional dimension to better
align with regional ecosystems, capabilities and needs. ESRA should be consulted to ensure that
regional semiconductor ecosystem perspectives are integrated into the shaping of the ECS-SRIA,
including SMEs needs and contribution.

## **2. Strengthening the Semiconductor Value Chain**

An integrated value chain is crucial for the long-term competitiveness of the EU semiconductor sector and for
reducing strategic dependencies to enhance its resilience. To this end, it is crucial to consolidate competitive
advantages in key industry segments, focus investments on the most promising segments to achieve or
maintain global leadership, and support also chips in larger nodes for the benefit of European industries.
Integrating a place-based approach in such a revised EU strategy will help significantly enhance the overall
impact, ensuring strategic goals are met while maximizing regional expertise to strengthen the resilience and
sustainability of the entire EU value chain.


ESRA calls for:


  - **Value Chain Approach:** The revised EU strategy must favour a value chain approach and incorporate
measures that enhance global leaders while connecting complementary specializations, identifying
vulnerabilities and bridging the gaps all along the entire semiconductor value chain (design, electronic
design automation, core IP, front-end, back-end, equipment and tools, materials). The regions are
ideally qualified for this, as they play a key role in building on local expertise and facilitating SMEs'
access to funding and support mechanisms, thus ensuring that regional players can fully benefit from
the available resources. As part of the value chain approach, the next Chips Act must ensure that the
technology know-how developed in the EU is effectively applied in the EU, via specific “supply chain
and IP licensing laws” towards a reinforced lab-to-fab strategy. We need to optimize the regional
ecosystems to facilitate the next generation of technology starts up.

  - **Increasing R&D, Technology and Testing Infrastructures** : The set of tools and investments, such as
pilot lines and design platforms, established by the EU Chips Act should be maintained and further
enhanced, and their effective utilization needs to be ensured. To maximize impact, it is crucial to
support and widen access for SMEs, address financial and regulatory barriers, concerns over R&D
confidentiality, guarantee technological neutrality and foster cross-regional collaboration. In addition,
a necessary condition for enhanced competitiveness is the combination of R&I excellence and
manufacturing knowledge and capacity: high-tech activities across the TRL scale should be supported
and facilitated, from basic research to market introduction and further to industrial deployment, in
order to strengthen resilience. A structured investment approach should align EU, national, and
regional strategies, ensuring efficient funding, seamless access, and stronger synergies between
industry, academia, and research infrastructures.

  - **Revising the ‘First of a Kind’ Criterion** : The shortage of semiconductors from larger technology nodes
was the primary factor that temporarily slowed down industrial production worldwide. European
industrial companies need secure access to all types of semiconductors to strengthen resilience and
ensure security in supply and production. Only by improving the availability of semiconductors across
all technology nodes – both leading-edge and mature – and supporting them accordingly Europe can
strengthen its strategic industrial sectors—such as automotive, energy, defence and digital services
—thus maintaining Europe's global competitiveness. ESRA therefore advocates for a revision of the
current first-of-a-kind criterion and for a better alignment of semiconductors with novel application
areas and cost-effective manufacturing.

## **3. Developing Skills, Talent, and Workforce**


Europe’s semiconductor strategy faces a severe and structural talent shortage that could slow innovation and
affect competitiveness in this key sector. To secure long-term growth and technological leadership, strong and
sustained investment in skills development will be essential. While the European Commission's Union of Skills
initiative provides a foundational framework, ESRA asks for more targeted and timely measures to address
this pressing challenge.

ESRA calls for:


  - **Enhancing STEM Awareness:** To build a skilled and sustainable semiconductor workforce a concerted
effort to promote STEM careers at both the EU and regional levels is essential. ESRA supports the
reinforcement of existing initiatives and launching coordinated EU-wide campaigns that emphasise
the pivotal role of microelectronics in driving key megatrends. Hands-on demonstrations, industry
showcases, and targeted early outreach, particularly to underrepresented groups, are essential to
engaging young talent. The STEM Education Strategic Plan and the establishment of the EU Skills
Academy on Semiconductors are important instruments equipping future professionals with the
necessary expertise, ensuring that educational curricula remain aligned with industry needs.


  - **Addressing Skills Gaps:** To tackle the shortage of skilled workers, targeted educational programmes
should provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities, ensuring workforce adaptability to
technological advancements. ESRA aligns with the Union of Skills framework, supporting a crossborder approach that encourages universities and businesses to collaborate on joint study
programmes, as a step toward a standardized European degree. It also supports the expansion of
micro-credentials and the standardization of qualifications across the EU. Regions can play a crucial
role by strengthening ties between industries and educational institutions, aligning efforts with EU
initiatives such as the European Chips Skills Academy.


  - **Attracting and Retaining Global Talent and Enhancing Regional Attractiveness:** To effectively address
talent shortages, a comprehensive programme promoting mobility and international exchanges is
required, including fiscal incentives, fast-track visas, and regional support for highly skilled foreign
workers. The Tech Skills Acquisition Programme, as proposed in the Draghi report, serves as a valuable
blueprint for investing in talent development within the semiconductor industry. Additionally,
enhancing the attractiveness of European regions through improved infrastructure, quality of life
incentives, and tailored policies is essential to drawing and retaining talent, thereby fostering a
welcoming and conducive environment for skilled professionals.


Europe must leverage the development and interconnections of regional ecosystems for a timely and efficient
uptake of the ongoing and upcoming investment efforts to guarantee the technological sovereignty of a
European semiconductor industry. ESRA has highlighted the most critical points: advancing and connecting
regional ecosystems, enhancing and improving IPCEIs and ECA with a regional involvement throughout the
EU funding landscape, especially within the ECS-SRIA **.** Europe must oversee the entire value chain and provide
needs-based support, including in larger nodes. Regions, as intermediaries between EU institutions and local
realities, are best positioned to strengthen the semiconductor value chain through a holistic approach to
ensure that the ecosystems' needs for R&D and infrastructure are met, while also integrating the rapidly
changing labour market. Priorities presented in this Position Paper, and in general the success of Europe’s
semiconductor strategy, depend on the availability of a skilled workforce. Therefore, it is critical to invest in
education, training, and industry collaborations to sustain Europe's semiconductor growth and ensure its
long-term competitiveness.


Semiconductors are vital for Europe's competitiveness, resilience, security, and green digital transition, and
regions as home to the ecosystems must play a key role in shaping policies to strengthen the European value
chain and workforce. As a key partner of the European Commission, ESRA is ready to contribute to the design,
development and implementation of future policies.
