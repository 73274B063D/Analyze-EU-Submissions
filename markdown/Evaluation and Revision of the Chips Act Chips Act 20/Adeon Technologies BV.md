feedback: The European PCB industry is only covering 1.9% of all the PCBs made worldwide.
  Since the late nineties this industry has shrunk by approx 75%. The recent initiatives
  like Chip Acts in the USA and EU are encouraging. However, Chips don't float. They
  are mounted on PCBs and IC Substrates (carriers) in order to perform. Also, there
  is a growing demand for embedding Chip alike functionality inside the carriers for
  miniaturisation. There are therefore crucial elements of our every day lives in
  Europe to be named for basically every type of industry applying PCBs and IC Substrates.
  With approx 180 PCB factories remaining in the EU & UK, this industry has achieved,
  and perhaps gone beyond, its required critical mass in order to keep European industries
  and most of all independance secured. All existing companies in this field should
  be saluted as they have all relentlessly continued to fight for their existance,
  without reachng out for help. However, the majority of this this technology is now
  for approx 59.8% in the hands of China alone. The US accounts for 3% but mainly
  lower technology and the rest is divided by other Asian countries, and currently
  a huge new capacity being under construction in south east Asia. This industry in
  Europe is not going to have to or want to grow to 10 or more percent, but if it
  will become even smaller, it will disappear within the ext 10 years. Especially
  with the energy transition and critical industries like medical, Life Science, Space,
  Industrial and recently growing demand for Defence will 100% rely on "Made in Europe".
  The raw material already come for 100% from outside Europe. This is even seeing
  import taxes, whereas Asian manufacturers can export to Europe the finished product,
  without any import duties. It is wrong and needs to be fixed Yesterday! Without
  this industry present in a healthy manner, Europe will be losing its strength in
  the world. The solutions are to be found in the aforementioned shift on import duties
  to finshed Asian products and scrapped for raw material. Regulations for building
  and investing should be closely discussed.
