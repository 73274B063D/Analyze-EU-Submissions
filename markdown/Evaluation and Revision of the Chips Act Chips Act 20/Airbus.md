**Airbus Position Paper on the Review of the European Chips Act (Chips Act 2)**


28 November 2025


**Executive Summary**


Airbus welcomes the launch of the review for the Chips Act (Chips Act 2) as a vital
opportunity to transition from an emergency-era response to **a robust, long-term strategic**
**industrial policy in support of European technological sovereignty** .


The current pace of technological development has positioned semiconductors as **a**
**strategic industry for strategic industries** ; while the geopolitical context has clearly shown
the **risk of weaponisation** in case of excessive dependencies.


Airbus thus fully supports the **Semicon Coalition Declaration** to ground the revised Act
around three strategic objectives: **Prosperity, Indispensability, and Resilience.**


However, Airbus believes that an EU semiconductor policy should be **guided by the need to**
**safeguard critical industrial sectors, among which Aerospace and Defence is second**
**to none**, as stated by the Declaration.


Therefore, the revised Act **must comprehensively address the unique needs of the full**
**Aerospace and Defence sector, and not only defence, as it represents a unique**
**ecosystem** . Our specific low-volume, long-lifecycle and high-reliability requirements—
particularly concerning component obsolescence and supply chain resilience for mature and
advanced chips— must be fully incorporated and protected across all pillars of the new
Regulation.


To overcome the shortcomings of the original Chips Act, a key focus should be to **enhance**
**production capacity in the EU** . However, this should be targeted not only towards
leading-edge chips but also legacy chips above 10nm. **Priority should be given on the**
**basis of the criticality and competitiveness of the end-markets** for the chips being
produced. The role of **industrial alliances will be key** to build virtuous circles by
aggregating demand in order to provide investment certainty and allow for innovation.


Moreover, the objectives will not be met without a **reinforced governance that provides for**
**better public-private information exchanges** in a confidential manner, visibility across
supply chains and strategic reserves.

**1. A strategic sector for strategic sectors**

Semiconductors are strategic assets for Airbus and the entire Aerospace and Defence supply
chain - practically raw materials for embedded electronics systems. The sector has been
severely affected by shortages, which have endangered the delivery of critical assets.


The **Aerospace and Defence sector as a whole thus must be explicitly designated and**
**fully encompassed as a “critical sector”**, and not just defence alone as was the case in
the original Act.


This is because our ecosystem is **fundamentally dual** . Civil and defence activities (aircraft,
helicopters, satellites, launchers), technologies, and skills are deeply intertwined - which

allows for **strong operational, financial, and industrial synergies** and constitutes a key
specificity and European asset.


Specifically, without successful civil aeronautics, the necessary increase in defence and
space capabilities cannot be delivered. This is also applicable with regards to our
semiconductor needs, where the **added volume coming from the much higher**
**commercial aircraft production helps to anchor demand** and enhance resiliency.


This reliance is particularly critical at a moment in which the sector is **ramping-up**
**production for commercial and defense portfolios in parallel** . In commercial aircraft, we
are currently targeting to deliver 1,000 aircraft per year by 2027, while we are responding to
the increasing needs of States in terms of defence readiness.


However, despite our ramp-up and the combined commercial and defence needs, the
worldwide aerospace market represents below 1% of global demand for advanced
semiconductors, with a negative trend due to the massive growth rates of other sectors like
Generative AI or Electric Vehicles.


Airbus, as an OEM leader with the capability to design, integrate and certify major aerospace
systems, tractioning the whole supply chain, has a prescriptive role on a new model setup
that ensures tomorrow’s industrial resilience.

**2. End-users as the starting point**


A core issue for Airbus is the significant **mismatch between the short lifecycle of**
**semiconductor components and the long operational lifecycle of its products** (20+
years), which is compounded by **stringent certification and airworthiness constraints** .
This mismatch requires changes of technology or re-sourcing of critical components (such as
highly complex integrated circuits) during the production lifecycle, representing a serious
burden. This is inadequately addressed by the current Act.


As a result, the reviewed Act must broaden its scope to fully consider and define **end-users**
**(such as Airbus) as part of the semiconductor value chain**, at least for strategic sectors.


Moreover, The Chips Act 2 must take into account end-user’s specific needs through
actionable measures to **achieve the necessary resilience** for advanced and mature chips’
design and production for aerospace and defence:


●​ **Longevity Feedback Obligation:** Component manufacturers must be obligated to

**provide information/feedback on the longevity of the component** during the life
of the product, extending beyond the current, inadequate 6-month prior notice before
obsolescence. Depending on the criticality of the component, we recommend
extending this period to a minimum of 3 years in order to be able to develop a
replacement strategy throughout the value chain.


●​ **Chip architecture transparency** : Requirements for transparency in chip architecture

necessary for airworthiness certification and substitution along the lifecycle of the end
product.

**3. Industrial alliances for competitive production**

Airbus supports the **conclusions of the Draghi report** that the Chips Act 2 must support a
**holistic industrial strategy that drives competitiveness and secures Europe’s**
**indispensable position** in the global value chain.


It is our view that more efforts need to be made in **increasing semiconductor production**
**in the EU**, beyond the First-of-a-kind concept of the original Act. A **strong semiconductors**
**ecosystem in the EU** (including, at least, chip manufacturing, packaging and testing) can
drive the EU’s prosperity through economic growth and contribute to closing the innovation
gap, strengthen the EU’s position in the global technological race, and reduce dependencies.


For this, **substantial public funds need to be mobilized, in a coordinated manner**
**between the national and EU level** . We welcome the proposal of the European
Competitiveness Fund as a fit-for-purpose tool that can support these efforts, specially for the
production of semiconductors which require low volume but are essential for strategic uses.
In this regard, EU investment must be tied to guarantees that funded industrial capabilities
will **prioritise critical sectors.**


However, **local semiconductor production needs to be competitive and sustainable**
**from an economic point of view** . Therefore, the European Commission, in close
coordination with Member States and the private sector, can play a key role through **demand**
**aggregation, in order to align demand and prioritise investments** in the production of
those chips which both have an ensured demand and support critical industrial sectors
downstream.


Therefore, **Airbus fully supports the establishment of vertical industrial alliances** that
can help make investments into semiconductor production a reality. We understand that
several alliances can be established focused on the needs of different sectors.


In this regard, it is important to stress that while cutting-edge technologies need to be
supported, for instance by strengthening our **local capability to control core chiplets’**
**ecosystem** either from an IP/die-level or encapsulation, packaging and testing point of view,
**more emphasis also needs to be put for the production of mature and current**
**technologies** (e.g., 28nm and above) that form the vast majority of our current and future
supply chain needs (power control, switching, IOs, …). The focus on the upstream value
chain (R&T, advanced technologies <16nm) is insufficient to support our immediate needs.


In order for local production to be competitive compared with the global actors in the US or
Asia, as a way to further aggregate demand, synergies between vertical alliances can be
established, e.g. with the automotive sector, which has much higher volumes than aerospace
and defence. Moreover, the EU can partner with like-minded players and countries to ensure
the resilience of the semiconductor value chain (design, manufacturing, packaging and
testing).


Another element to take into account when pursuing semiconductor production in the EU is
to have the **right enabling conditions**, in terms of sufficient and affordable energy and
skills, amongst others.


Finally, in line with other upcoming EU initiatives such as the RESourceEU Plan and the
Industrial Accelerator Act, in parallel to local production coming online, measures could be
introduced to introduce **local content requirements as a way to establish lead markets**

**for resilient chips supply** . However, this should be done in a way that doesn’t hinder the
competitiveness nor the resilience of end-users.


**4. Prepare the future**


From the same end-users first approach, and while the priority should remain to increase
semiconductor production, it would be **wise not to lose track of the future needs of critical**
**sectors**, such as aerospace and defence, **in order not to further deepen dependencies.**


While keeping the same specificities in terms of volume, reliability and life-cycle, undoubtedly
as our systems become more complex, connected and digital, there is an increasing need in
terms of processing power for highly-critical applications, such as AI-based functions,
specially onboard defence and space systems. However, it is currently extremely difficult to
procure semiconductors which **comply with both performance and certification**
**requirements** .


Therefore, a secondary target in terms of establishing an European semiconductor value
chain would be to extend it to the design of novel **high-performance processing chips for**
**highly critical applications**, to secure future business and capabilities.


As the same competitiveness constraints would apply, growth potential and synergies could
be established as well with other industries e.g. automotive and industrial systems. This
would support the sector’s future resilience and ensure the EU’s indispensability in critical
segments of the global value chain.

**5. Reinforced resilience to protect from geopolitical turmoil**


The proven risks of weaponisation of the semiconductors value chain call for reinforced
measures to strengthen its resilience from supply disruptions through enhanced visibility and
the creation of stock buffers. This shall include:


●​ Promote greater **transparency and traceability** from intermediaries (distributors,

EMS, etc.). They must inform semiconductor producers about the end-user/sector so
that a proper impact assessment is considered in the prioritisation process.


●​ Reinforce mechanisms for a **more comprehensive monitoring and mapping of the**

**semiconductor value chain**, including inventory levels, production bottlenecks, and
critical dependencies, particularly for components relevant to strategic sectors, while
ensuring confidentiality.


●​ Identify and organise **strategic stocks of critical variants’ references f** or which

there is not yet a redesign alternative, in coordination with producers and end-users.
Industrial alliances can play a role through **incentives for additional production** put
into these reserves.


●​ In case of supply disruptions, **strategic sectors need to have prioritised access** to

supplies.


●​ This prioritisation within the EU must prevail over other extraterritorial jurisdictions,

such as the **US Defence Priorities and Allocation System (DPAS),** which can
currently block European access to core electronic components. Undertakings

benefiting from European funds should guarantee access to core components to
critical sectors on European soil.


**6. A joint effort which requires a reinforced governance**


Airbus believes that the ambitious but necessary objectives set for the Chips Act 2 require a
joint effort across the semiconductor value chain, end-users and public institutions at EU and
national levels.


Therefore, in line with the proposal to establish an overarching EU Competitiveness
Coordination Tool, the European Semiconductors Board should be engrained as the “chips
leg” of the former, while being reinforced in order to carry out the demand aggregation and
value-chain monitoring described above.


As part of its governance architecture, the EU should look for and adopt, _mutatis mutandis_,
the best practices from other leading powers in the semiconductors value chain, such as the
the establishment of a body with the scope and responsibilities akin to the US National
Semiconductor Technology Center (NTSC).


Moreover, building on the establishment of the **Observatory of Emerging Technologies** as
per the European Competitiveness Fund proposal, the working of the current **Observatory**
**of Critical Technologies should be transformed so that the private sector can**
**participate.** This would allow for synergies, better situational awareness and reduced
duplication in mapping efforts between the public and private sectors.
