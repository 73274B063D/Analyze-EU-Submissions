feedback: The EU chip industry and the EU dependence on chip supplies have been well
  identified. Although the diagnostic was clear, the EU answer with the chip act has
  been disappointing. The chip industry need a global consolidated answer at the EU
  level with the appropriate level of funding and expert teams. The EU chip act has
  just enable EU countries to subsidise chip foundry with a lot of difficult criterias
  and too much administrative burden. The next initiative should be mastered by EU
  funds with EU centralised expertise and with a large amount of funding. The areas
  of funding should be on front-end AND back end, on mature AND advanced nodes, on
  digital AND analog/discrete chips. A strong program on the demand side should be
  put in place to help SMEs to develop ASIC or chips.
