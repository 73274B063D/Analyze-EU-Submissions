# **Aledia Proposition for Chips Act** **Initiative**

**Title:** MicroLED Arrays for Optical Interconnects in AI Data Centers


**Summary:**
To support the development of artificial intelligence, data transfer must be significantly improved in both
speed and energy efficiency. Traditional copper interconnects are highly energy-intensive and are
approaching their physical and performance limits. While lasers are beginning to be deployed in data
centers, they still face challenges related to power consumption and data density.


MicroLED technology presents a promising alternative, with the potential to reduce power consumption by
a factor of ten while significantly increasing data transfer density.


As part of the Chips Act 2.0 initiative, we propose the inclusion of a strategic focus on innovative
optoelectronic technologies for high-performance computing architectures dedicated to artificial
intelligence. Aledia, a European pioneer in 3D MicroLEDs based on nanowires on silicon, aims to develop
ultra-fast MicroLED arrays capable of transmitting data optically at very high frequencies between critical
components such as GPUs and HBM modules in inter-chip configurations.


This approach seeks to replace or complement traditional electrical interconnects within packages or
boards, optimizing bandwidth, latency, and energy efficiency.


**Project Objectives:**


  - Develop addressable MicroLED arrays for optical data transmission in high-performance AI
environments.


  - Leverage the directional emission and fast modulation capabilities of nanowire-based MicroLEDs
to enable low-latency, high-density optical links between GPU and HBM.


  - Integrate these arrays into compact photonic modules compatible with chiplet architectures and
heterogeneous systems.


  - Reduce internal interconnect power consumption through efficient electro-optical conversion at the
component level.


**Expected Impact:**


  - Strengthening European technological sovereignty in critical AI infrastructure.


  - Establishing a new optoelectronic sector around MicroLEDs for advanced computing architectures.


  - Creating synergies with European stakeholders in photonics, advanced packaging, and embedded
systems.

**Call for Support:**
We recommend that Chips Act 2.0 include a dedicated axis for optoelectronic technologies for AI,
including:


  - Funding pilot lines for the fabrication of fast-modulation MicroLED arrays.


  - Supporting collaborative projects between chip manufacturers, system integrators, and research
institutes.


  - Recognizing MicroLEDs as a strategic technology for inter-chip optical communication in AI
architectures.
