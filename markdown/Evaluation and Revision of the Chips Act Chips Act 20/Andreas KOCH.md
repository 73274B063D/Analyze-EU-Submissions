feedback: While the Chips Act with its many initiatives has already proven highly
  beneficial to spur new innovations or kindle tech transfers from academia to industry,
  as well as maintain critical support infrastructure such as EUROPRACTICE for EDA
  tools access, a number of areas could profit from further attention. 1) While there
  has been considerable progress has been made on the processor (mostly RISC-V) as
  well as AI accelerator side of hardware IP blocks, what is still sorely missing
  are European (ideally open-source) high-speed I/O blocks for crucial interfaces
  such as PCI Express and DDR DRAM. As such IP, critical to actually realize computing
  _systems_, is currently only available from Asian and US suppliers, its lack is
  a key weakness in European digital sovereignty. 2) The lack of open PDKs for competitive,
  more modern processes (sub-90nm), preferably for technologies actually fabricated
  in Europe, is complicating research, education, as well as the entry of innovative
  SMEs into the market due to the large paperwork effort and long delays associated
  with getting access to proprietary PDKs. If possible, the Chips Act should provide
  support to entities creating open-access / open-source PDKs (including complete
  standard cell libraries), similar to the way Google sponsored creating the open
  PDK for Skywater 130nm in the US. 3) The current funding scheme of just 70% for
  academic partners in many of the Chips JU programs makes it very difficult to contribute
  expertise to the programs. The argument, that the indirect costs can be used to
  make-up for the underfunding is not generally valid, as in many cases University
  central admin cashes in these monies, leaving the actual research groups struggling
  themselves on how to cover the actual costs. This even applies to the JU programs
  that _do_ cover 100% from the EU side, as national funding organizations tend to
  still play games with their contribution, which, combined with the tendency of central
  admin to take a cut of all incoming funds, still leads to underfunding at the researcher
  level. It would be highly recommended that the EU clarifies to the national partners
  (and institutional central admin) that 100% means _100% actually available at the
  researcher level_.
