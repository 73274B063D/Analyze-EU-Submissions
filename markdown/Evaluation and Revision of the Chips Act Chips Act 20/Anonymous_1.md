feedback: Chemical material investments / capacity expansions from mid-sized companies
  should be included, be it wet chemicals or dry chemicals, specifically those that
  are used for cleaning and etching, as these are used in many production steps in
  chip manufacturing. Europe should not become dependent from Asian supply due to
  due two reasons. 1) resilience 2) immense GHG emissions if Europe continues to import
  from other regions 2a) chemicals that might get produced with lower GHG emission
  standards and 2b) tanks that get shipped with emission-rich ships using sulfuric
  diesel. Thank you!
