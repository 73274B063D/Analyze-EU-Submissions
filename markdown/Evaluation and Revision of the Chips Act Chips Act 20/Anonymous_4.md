feedback: The EU Chips Act is an initiative of great importance for the overall EU
  semi infrastructure. The continuation of funding is of most importance. Realistically,
  EU should not focus in mature technologies like Silicon, where the cost to compete
  with current players is extremely high. It could provide more funds to enable technologies
  that they are already established but there is still room to provide beyond SOTA
  semiconductors solutions/products/services using materials like III-V semiconductors
  (ex. GaN) or SiC. Furthermore, there should be more funding opportunities for small
  research facilities to grow in order to provide prototyping and small volume production
  so there would be able to keep and even increase their research staff. This initiative
  would further increase EU output regarding R&D activities. These facilities could
  enable fabless design houses opportunities to prototype with far smaller cost. Furthermore,
  they could specialize in fields (special process, packaging, measurements etc. )
  where the big EU foundries do not have the resources/time/manpower to invest. Additionally,
  the Southern Europe could play a key role due to the fact that it could provide
  the manpower and facilities for such endeavor.
