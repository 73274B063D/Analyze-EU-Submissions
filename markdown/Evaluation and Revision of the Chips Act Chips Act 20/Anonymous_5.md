feedback: 'Chips Act and related programs seem to support well research and spin-offs
  like semiconductor start-ups e.g. with pilot lines, competence centers, design platform
  and startup-funding mechanisms. It has also enabled accelerating fab investment
  mainly for legacy nodes based technology. Automotive industry has got special attention.
  If Chips Act will be updated, there could be more emphasis on enabling EU system
  companies to accelerate their Chip Design activity to keep those companies and critical
  systems competitive. Connectivity solutions like mobile networks and optical networks
  chip design should have dedicated program. From instrument types e.g IPCEI might
  be good as it enables commercialization of inventions, the real innovation will
  be thus tested on the market. IPCEI typically is Member state part funded, but for
  EU Critical systems the public funding could come from EU Competitiveness fund.
  As the chips are not the main target but these programs need to help EU competitiveness,
  security and safety and sovereignty, it means that funding per project needs to
  enable strategic acceration. ( key areas: defense, connectivity, Edge cloud, Data
  centers, AI SW and AI based digital services: these would set requirement for semiconductors)'
