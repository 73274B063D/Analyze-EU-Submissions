feedback: Chips Act 2.0 should support the reshoring of legacy technologies as well,
  not only high end nodes. As such, investments in production lines for planar technologies
  from 180nm to 28nm as well as commoditized chip packaging (including leadframe packaging).
  This reuires punctual support to enterpreneurs to overcome the CAPEX barrier.
