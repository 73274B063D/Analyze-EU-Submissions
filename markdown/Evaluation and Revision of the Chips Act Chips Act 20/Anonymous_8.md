feedback: Hello, I have been 25 years in electronics industry and R&D. Don't see any
  new and really good chip design, packaging, manufacturing jobs to appear. It is
  a lot of fluffy papers and news, but is mainly into 1-2 big countries like France
  and Germany and even there is quite limited investment. PCB manufacturing is basically
  dead. Europe is totally dependent from external chip manufacturers, down to simple
  logic. May be only some transistors and sensors are made on the continent. Basically...things
  are going down, especially compared to US and Asia. And it is not easy way build
  back thw industry.
