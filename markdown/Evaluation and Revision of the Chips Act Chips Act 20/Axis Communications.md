feedback: 'Axis Communications began exploring chip design in the late 1980s, developing
  its first in-house chip, the ARTPEC SoC, in 1999. Chip development has fueled our
  innovation and growth ever since. As a successful European scale-up, we urge the
  EU to prioritize the following: 1. Build and retain semiconductor talent in the
  EU Semiconductor competence is essential for Europes resilience and competitiveness.
  Europe continues to face talent shortages, the loss of international talent, and
  a high dependency on non-European expertise. To strengthen long-term capabilities,
  the EU must support a functioning talent market with cross-border mobility and education
  aligned with industry needs. The focus should remain on digital system designincluding
  ASIC and IP developmentwhere Europe already demonstrates strong expertise. Maintaining
  skills in related areas such as PCB design is also important for sovereignty, but
  digital system design should stay the strategic priority. 2. Build a European design
  ecosystem for reusable IP and EDA tools To reduce dependency on non-European actors,
  the EU should prioritize the development of: - Reusable, EU-developed IP building
  blocks (e.g., CPUs, NPUs/AI accelerators) - European EDA tools, which are central
  to every stage of chip development Strengthening European IP and EDA capabilities
  is a highly cost-efficient way to build resilience and should precede investments
  in large-scale manufacturing. A coordinated European design ecosystem would accelerate
  competence building, ensure continuity of key technologies and help semiconductor
  scale-ups grow within Europe. It would also allow major industrial players to confidently
  select European providers, increasing overall autonomy in the value chain. 3. Enable
  high-TRL scale-up collaboration We see a need for a new type of EU structure that
  enables new innovative technology to be validated in real industrial environments
  that supports fast industrialization. Europe has many semiconductor research initiatives,
  but very few commercial scale-ups with proven chip design and mass-market deployment.
  Axis is one of the rare European companies that has scaled its own ASIC development
  into global products. Our experience has taught us that validating new innovative
  technology is crucial. It allows industrial actors to reduce risk and industrialize
  more quickly, which both are prerequisites for scalability. While Chips Act 1 focused
  heavily on low-TRL research projects and funding was shattered, Chips Act 2 must
  focus on deployment-focused, high-TRL pilot projects (close to industrialization).
  Today, small European innovators struggle to validate new technologies because semiconductor
  development is expensive, high-risk (and thus difficult to finance) and several
  areas are dominated by established suppliers. To change this dynamic we urge the
  EU to in the implementation of Chips Act 2 consider new formats for industrial collaboration
  where large industrial players act as requirement owners and advisors, academy and
  smaller companies can test and validate new technology. Such joint ventures would
  share risk and investment between companies, Member States and academia. While research
  programs exist today (e.g. Horizon Europe, Chips JU), there are few instruments
  that support high-TRL industrialization where large industry partners act as requirement
  owners and validators. This gap prevents European chip innovation from scaling.
  A flagship initiative could be a jointly specified EU Chip, where several industry
  partners define common requirements and validate the chip together, making EU technology
  testable, verifiable and scalable. In addition to technology validation, such industry-driven
  pilot projects would also improve supply chain transparency and ecosystem visibility,
  which the Commission identifies as a current gap. Such projects would also give
  the EU real-time insight into bottlenecks, talent needs and potential strategic
  dependencies.'
