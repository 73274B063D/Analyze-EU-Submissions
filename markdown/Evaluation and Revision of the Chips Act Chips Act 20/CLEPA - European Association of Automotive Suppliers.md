feedback: CLEPA welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the review of the European
  Chips Act. While the Chips Act represents an important step forward, several gaps
  remain in bridging the distance between research and industrial deployment, strengthening
  backend manufacturing capabilities, and enabling a complete, efficient value chain
  that reflects the needs of Europes automotive and industrial ecosystems. Pillar
  I The Chips for Europe Initiative Pillar I provides important research capabilities,
  but it does not yet generate the support required for the technologies and developments
  needed to enable industrial-scale deployment for the automotive industry. At present,
  no clear pipeline exists between what is developed in Pillar I and what should be
  manufactured in future European facilities. To be effective, Pillar I must translate
  development programmes into producible technologies and directly address the requirements
  of European downstream industries as the automotive industry. The Chips Act 2 and
  its research and development arm should be designed with end-user needs in mind
  and must contribute to future capacity guarantees, helping to correct the current
  imbalance between strong European automotive demand and limited regional production
  options. Pillar II Security of supply and resilience Pillar IIs scope remains narrowly
  focused on frontend fabs. While backend processes are formally included, current
  investments in backend remain limited because the European backend manufacturing
  sector is not competitive, leaving critical capacity gaps unaddressed. Operational
  expenditure support for backend activities is essential to enable industrial-scale
  deployment and ensure that Europe can meet automotive and broader industrial demand.
  To achieve this, a targeted revision of state aid rules should be envisaged, allowing
  OPEX support for specific segments of the supply chain, for example for backend
  operations, advanced packaging, testing, and assembly, while ensuring that funding
  remains efficient and focused. Beyond addressing backend, structural weaknesses
  (i.e. high energy costs, administrative burdens, permitting delays, and skill shortages)
  must be tackled to make Europe a competitive and reliable location for semiconductor
  production. Investments should strengthen the full automotive semiconductor ecosystem.
  EU-level coordination is critical to prevent fragmentation across Member States,
  and design/fabless companies as well as upstream suppliers should be fully integrated
  into the security-of-supply framework. Finally, the status and incentives of production
  facilities should be aligned with actual market needs and the requirements of full-value-chain
  integration. Pillar III Monitoring and crisis response Pillar III establishes monitoring
  and crisis response mechanisms, but its current approach is largely reactive and
  narrowly focused on semiconductor supply data. Existing tools rely heavily on static
  databases rather than real-time dialogue, which limits the EUs ability to anticipate
  geopolitical risks, export controls, or supply chain disruptions. System-level vulnerabilities
  in the automotive sector are insufficiently addressed, and governance does not fully
  integrate end-user industries or industrialisation challenges. Pillar III should
  replace passive data collection with proactive, continuous dialogue between industry
  and the Commission. Geopolitical risks, export controls, logistics, and bottlenecks
  should be monitored in real time, and the entire automotive ecosystem should be
  involved in crisis monitoring. Clear and predictable early-warning indicators should
  be established, focusing on non-substitutable components and geopolitical triggers.
  EU-level coordination is needed to prevent fragmented national responses, and crisis
  preparedness should consider industrialisation and market uptake bottlenecks, not
  only raw supply constraints.
