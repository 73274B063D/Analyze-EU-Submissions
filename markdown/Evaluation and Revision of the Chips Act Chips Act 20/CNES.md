feedback: 'CNES feedback for EU Chips Act 2.0 The competitiveness and the sovereignty
  or European space industry are directly dependent to the availability of strategic
  EEE components with sustainable supply chains. It is almost important to improve
  Europe non-dependence with regards to EEE components and semi-conductors. Space
  components are based on commercial technologies and hardening, space evaluation
  and qualification are done to use in space environment. CNES roadmap is in line
  with the Components Technology Board (CTB) roadmap from ESCC organization (European
  Space Components Coordination). The critical components for Space are : Ultra Deep
  Sub-Micron technology for ASIC and Rad-hard FPGA, Chiplet Microprocessors and Micro-controllers
  Power GaN/SiC Photonics, Detectors RF GaN Technologies Packaging, PCBs, Electronic
  Assembly Passives & RF Passives Support from the EU Chips Act 1.0 and 2.0 for these
  space critical technologies would be a significant benefit to European space ecosystem.'
