feedback: The adoption of the EU Chips Act in 2023, was a necessary step for Europes
  semiconductor industry, ensuring technological sovereignty, innovation and supply
  chain resilience, and we can already see some great achievements. Nevertheless,
  these efforts must now be extended to PCB and PCBA industry (chips dont float).
  The European PCB industry is very fragile and has decreased considerably in the
  last 20 years. Today, a very significant portion of global PCB production is concentrated
  in Asia. By encouraging the development of this industry in Europe, the EU Chips
  Act 2.0 would help reduce this dependence, secure the supply chain of strategic
  electronic components and also help R&D development to insure competitiveness and
  anticipation of future needs. European space industry has developed strong skills
  and experience for high reliability board assembly to comply with severe environmental
  requirements. But the increasing power dissipation and density of I/Os in new strategic
  components induce a need for improving the thermal and mechanical management in
  the assembly of packages to PCBs. Supporting the PCB and assembly industry under
  the EU Chips Act 2.0 will be a strategic measure that strengthens technological
  sovereignty, reduces external dependencies, stimulates innovation and create jobs.
  It is therefore essential to include thoses sectors in the action plans priorities.
