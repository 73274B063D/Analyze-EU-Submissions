  scope extends from the physical (wireless/optical) layer through the stack of control
  and application layers, to socio-economic aspects of network deployment, sustainability,
  resilience, and security. Networks are of strategic importance to Europes resilience,
  competitiveness, and technological sovereignty, depend on chips, and so are relevant
  to the European Chips Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/1781). Silicon supply chain fragilities
  are well known. Europe is overdependent on major Asian foundries, with high minimum
  order quantities and long lead time. High end CMOS chips can be and are made in
  the EU. Compound semiconductors are critical importance to networks, are. Networks
  depend on specialist semiconductor products including, among others, radiofrequency
  circuits, power amplifiers, optoelectronic chips (telecoms wavelength lasers), pump
  lasers for optical amplifiers, using the physics of direct bandgap (compound) semiconductors,
  epitaxially grown layer by layer as engineered device material on a wafer, which
  is then fabricated into chips. Europe must have a sovereign supply chain of epitaxial
  device material wafers with device fabrication and packaging materials to produce
  components. Optoelectronic device packaging, and rf device packaging, are also specialist
  niches, as is the fabrication and packaging of antennae, today complex devices extending
  to reconfigurable MIMO devices and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). Printed
  and additive electronics are critical for future sustainable manufacture of sensors
  and antennae and should come within the scope of the Chips Act. The Airbus Industrie
  model created a rival to Boeing, by organising a sovereign European supply chain
  from the diversity of European industry. This model could create a European hyperscale
  network operator of scale. It could also marshal our chip fabrication capabilities,
  especially in niche sectors, to create a European capability to rival TSMC and other
  large players, to give Europe scale in the notoriously fragmented compound semiconductor
  device market, and to ensure European design and manufacturing capability of key
  enabling chip classes, especially graphics processing units (GPU) which have critical
  non-graphics applications in AI. A dirigiste approach, and the powers to make such
  market intervention and organisation, especially in a supply chain emergency, will
  be required to lead and direct such an enterprise. We refer to the below evidence

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**


The purpose of this document is to provide a first comprehensive set of key strategic
reflections and recommendations for 6G smart networks and services, capturing the views
and priorities from the members of the 6G-IA. The goal is that this document will be used to
further elaborate future versions of the SNS JU Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda

(SRIA) as well as the R&I Work Programmes. It also aims to offer directions for collaboration
opportunities for European Stakeholders that will go beyond the scope of the SNS JU. It is the
plan of 6G-IA to use this as a “living document” where topics will be updated or highlighted
(by producing specific strategic documents) in the coming years, following the

technological advances, market uptake and ecosystem evolution.


In this document the following areas are considered and analysed.


  - **6G Technological Sovereignty** which includes a) components and microelectronics,
b) open SNS solutions, c) cloudification and distributed computing, d) network
intelligence, e) security and privacy and f) knowledge base

  - **Sustainability** which captures all aspects of environmental, societal and economic
sustainability


This document provides a brief analysis of each area and proposes concrete
recommendations. The key observations and recommendations of the document are
summarized as follows:


Technological sovereignty on components and microelectronics: the target should be to
find solutions through research activities that will ensure that supply chains for products,
components, materials and know-how are diversified. In terms of European research, the

way to address this is through the identification of synergies with related EU Partnerships, so
that coherence among research efforts is achieved.


Technological sovereignty on open SNS solutions: Further strengthening of research and
innovation activities are needed, ensuring that the results from current activities are
capitalized, to reach sound and widely accepted conclusions. All research efforts should

work under the assumption of technology-neutral regulation, not
mandating any architectures but rather pursuing the most suitable and efficient solutions
for the European stakeholders.


Technological sovereignty on cloudification and distributed computing: Further research
efforts are needed to ensure Interoperability between cloud infrastructures. That way it is
possible to have different independent cloud infrastructures that are separately optimised
for a specific task or market. Additionally it is important to identify open-source activities
that will support such interoperability. Therefore, it is key to ensure that, where relevant, the

produced solutions are integrated with the research and innovation actions being
developed in the context of the SNS JU.

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


Technological sovereignty on network intelligence: Existing results from the 5G PPP era have
indicated the need for a globally accepted framework where AI/ML will be benchmarked

and validated. Additionally, appropriate training data sets are needed to support such a
framework. These can be developed in the context of the research and innovation actions
in the context of the SNS JU. To allow interconnection and interoperation of AI, digital twins
and other intelligent components across different stakeholders, open solutions and well
selected standardised interfaces are needed for training and execution of AI models.


Technological sovereignty on security and privacy: It is important to create a collaborative
environment for key public and private forces to cover the complete range of needs from
research activities, develop security solutions in critical hardware and software modules
and foster solutions that will conform to European policies and legislation by meeting

European values.


Technological sovereignty on knowledge experts base: Research and innovation activities
should actively contribute towards a timely integration of the knowledge produced by SNS
R&I activities in the educational process at the European level and measures to grow the

base of experts in Europe.

Sustainability: This is globally accepted as a key target for 6G. Sustainability as a term
encompasses both new solutions for sustainable Information and Communication

technology (ICT) as well as ICT innovations to support sustainability on all vertical sectors.
Therefore, it is imperative to develop a framework that will serve for the quantitative
evaluation of solutions designed to support environmental, societal and economical
sustainability measured by key value indicators.

In follow-up work and position development the implications of the above will be addressed

in the context of and for the anticipation of future developments of the service provider
ecosystems and multi-stakeholder service platforms.

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services

## **1. INTRODUCTION**


The purpose of this document is to provide a first comprehensive set of key strategic
reflections and recommendations for 6G smart networks and services, capturing the views
and priorities from the members of the 6G-IA. The goal is that this document will be used to
further elaborate future versions of the SNS JU Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda
(SRIA) as well as the R&I Work Programmes. It also aims to offer directions for collaboration

opportunities for European Stakeholders that will go beyond the scope of the SNS JU. It is the
plan of 6G-IA to use this as a “living document” where topics will be updated or highlighted
(by producing specific strategic documents) in the coming years, following the
technological advances, market uptake and ecosystem evolution.


The way we live, work and interact has changed considerably during the past years. The

importance of information, how it is exchanged, stored and processed, plays a key factor in
all aspects of our civilization. The role of the communication infrastructure and services has
now a dominant position for all. It is an undeniable fact that telecommunication

technologies and services can improve our lives but is also a double-edged sword that
could create significant problems and threats if not addressed properly.

Nowadays, we are witnessing the changes that advancements in 5G networks as well

related enablers, like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), High Performance
Computing (HPC), Cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), etc., bring for all. Moreover, the
technological evolution and its applications keep on progressing at a substantial rate.

The work for 6G Networks and Services has started and multiple activities are taking place
at a global level. In Europe, the 6G Smart Networks and Services Industry Association (6G
IA), in collaboration with the supporting Associations NetworldEurope, Alliance for Internet of
Things Innovation (AIOTI), CISPE.cloud and NESSI, prepared a proposal for a European
Partnership for Smart Networks and Services to be implemented in the context of Horizon

Europe Framework (HEU) [1].

In November 2021, the Council Regulation 2021/2085 [2] established the SNS Joint

undertaking (JU) [3] as a legal and funding entity as part of the 10 European Partnerships

[4] to step up the green and digital transition. The SNS JU enables the pooling of EU’s
industrial and academic/research resources in Smart Networks and Services. It also fosters
alignment with EU Member States for 6G Research and Innovation, and deployment of

advanced 5G networks. The SNS JU sets out an ambitious mission with an EU funding budget
of € 900 million for the period 2021-2027.


As indicated in the official website, the Smart Networks and Services (SNS) Joint Undertaking
(JU) has two main missions:

1. **Fostering Europe’s technology and digital service sovereignty in 6G** by
implementing the related research and innovation (R&I) programme leading to the
conception and standardisation starting around 2025. It encourages preparation for

early market adoption of 6G technologies and digital services by the end of the
decade. Mobilising a broad set of stakeholders is key to address strategic areas of
the network technologies and services value chain. This ranges from network edge

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


and cloud-based service provisioning to market opportunities in new components
and devices beyond smartphones.

2. **Boosting 5G deployment in Europe** in view of developing digital lead markets and

enabling the digital and green transition of the economy and society. To address this
objective, the SNS JU coordinates strategic guidance for the relevant programmes
under the Connecting Europe Facility [5], in particular 5G Corridors. It also
contributes to the coordination of national programmes, including the Recovery and
Resilience Facility [6] and other European programmes and facilities such as the

Digital Europe Programme (DEP) [7] and InvestEU.


The SNS JU also supports technological sovereignty for Europe, in line with the 5G
Cybersecurity Toolbox [8], the Cybersecurity Strategy [9] and the industrial strategy [10].


The partnership enables a solid research and innovation (R&I) roadmap [11] as well as a
deployment agenda [12] set out and followed by a critical mass of European actors. Already,
this roadmap is being implemented through the first SNS R&I Work Programmes [13].


As scientific and technological breakthroughs keep on evolving, it is of paramount
importance for **the European industry, the** **Research Community and Academia** not only

to follow these developments, but also to **have a clear strategy** on how Europe should
position itself to:


a. Ensure European leadership for 6G smart networks and services through the

development of advanced systems, applications and services, design and offer
competitive connectivity solutions considering the full value chain, and contribute to

technological sovereignty,
b. Improve the digital industries operation by identifying needs and offer solutions,

provide advanced infrastructures, and create a fertile business ecosystem,

c. Address societal needs and policy objectives by meeting relevant Sustainable

Development Goals (UN SDGs [14]), support the EU Green Deal targets, and
safeguard security and privacy.


In this document the following areas are considered and analysed in the following

subsections. These strategies are divided in two main pillars as shown in Figure 1.


  - **6G Technological Sovereignty** which includes a) components and microelectronics,

b) Open SNS solutions, c) cloudification and distributed computing, d) network
intelligence, e) security and privacy and f) knowledge base

  - **Sustainability** which captures all aspects of environmental, societal and economic
sustainability

Finally, it is very important that all key stakeholders from the private, public, research and

educational communities work together on reciprocal basis to develop globally accepted

6G standards. Moreover, digitalization is now modernizing many different vertical sectors.

Therefore, it is in the clear interest of businesses that globally accepted standards and

specifications will be developed for the digital products and services related to strategic

European industrial sectors, e.g., the manufacturing, health, transport, energy, financial

services, smart city and agriculture sectors in the 6G era.


To achieve the goal of 6G globally accepted standards several tangible and sequential

steps must take place, such as:


  - Establish cooperation with counterparts in other regions and vertical sectors by
means of MoUs and joint events for information exchange and alignment of research
work programmes.


  - Maintain and further develop the global standardization ecosystem to cooperate
towards globally accepted standards for the benefit of end customers and industry
for interoperability, economy of scale and minimizing cost.

## **2. ACHIEVING 6G TECHNOLOGICAL** **SOVEREIGNTY FOR EUROPE**

According to [15], the term **technological sovereignty** is defined as: _“… the ability for Europe_
_to develop, provide, protect, and retain critical technologies required for the welfare of_
_European citizens and prosperity of businesses, and the ability to act and decide_

_independently in a globalised environment_ ”. According to the same source, this definition
encompasses three key elements, namely:

  - _“Technological – the development of European R&D competencies by maintaining_
_a strong knowledge base, strong industry, and strong networks in the critical_
_technologies._


  - _Economic – the achievement and preservation of a position of leadership in Key_
_Enabling Technologies (KETs), the ability to turn R&D into market products, and_

_having access to a diversity of resources along the value chain with the aim of_
_reducing dependence on third countries;_

  - _Regulatory – the development of adequate policies and standards to influence_

_global regulation, standards, and practices that reflect European values.”_

The definition of **sovereignty** does not include the following extreme positions: on one hand
**autarky**, which means the economic independence from other countries, which would
require no dependencies on goods, materials, manufacturing, services and deliveries from
other countries and import and exports with other countries, and on the other hand,
**heteronomy** like control by other countries.


These extreme positions are considered to be inefficient and unrealistic as they would be
counter-productive for innovation, the economic prosperity and global trade. In the current

document the focus is mainly on the technological element, acknowledging however that
proposing key strategies cannot avoid providing also suggestions related to economic and
the regulatory elements.


In [15], 6 **key enabling technologies** have been identified for the technological sovereignty

of Europe. Among these, **Security and Connectivity technologies** are included as most
relevant for SNS. Additionally, 5 challenges are identified namely: a) lack of resources/raw
materials, b) dependence on non-European suppliers, c) digital skills, d) commercialization

of research results and e) lack of joint action and coordination.


The current document focuses mainly on the last four challenges and tries to provide some
guidance on the way forward.


It is worth noting that the discussion on technological sovereignty cannot be decoupled
from the geopolitical context. In a globalized economy it is worth studying the weaknesses

and strengths of each region to understand how global cooperation and supply chains are
currently formed.

Table 1 provides a rough analysis of the critical dependencies in selected technology fields
between the USA, Europe, China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan. Clearly, Europe is very strong in

communication networks. However, it is very dependent in (high-end) micro-electronics,
cloud technology and the platform economy.


It is no secret that the world is facing some significant geopolitical changes. Countries or
regions openly target a certain level of sovereignty to implement co-dependency and to
improve resilience. At the same time today’s economy is strongly globalized, and modern

big companies are naturally multinational and active across many regions. A diversity of
sources achieved as a combination of own capabilities and trade seems to be a viable way
to achieve resilience. This resilience is also desired so that European values on regulatory
aspects such as security, privacy, lawful interception, competition law, net neutrality, etc., as

well as policies related to climate change, sustainability, and inclusion are implementable.

From the above table, it is clear that although Europe currently has a strong position in

telecommunications, an analysis is needed of how European strengths can be maintained
and developed, especially towards 6G. For example, the SNS JU aims to keep industry in
Europe at the forefront of development and to catchup in areas, where Europe is behind. The

following sections analyse several of the abovementioned domains and offer concrete

recommendations.


Dissemination level: Public | **9**


6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services

### **2.1. COMPONENTS AND MICRO-ELECTRONICS**


The **Horizon 2020 COREnect project** [16] has developed an industry roadmap to improve the
European technological sovereignty in the microelectronics domain. The proposed industry
roadmap is publicly available in the COREnect Deliverables D3.6 [17] and D3.7 [18].


The COREnect project investigated the following sectors by means of SWOT (strengths,

weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis:

  - Automotive grade connectivity,

  - Infrastructure connectivity,

  - Industrial grade connectivity and

  - Consumer grade connectivity.


In the SNS context especially the infrastructure connectivity is of interest. The expert group
proposed several concrete short-term, medium-term and long-term strategic actions to

address technological sovereignty [18].

It is worth noting that in January 2023 a new **EU funded project called COREnext** [19] has
started its R&I activities. The Project brings together expert stakeholders in future mobile

networks and integrate their perspective in key focus areas like digital, analogue and
integrated solutions for computing communication and sensing. The consortium is
expecting to develop a trustworthy-by-design platform based on a new computing
architecture for base stations to push European capabilities in B5G/6G to the next level.

The new **IPCEI (Important Project on Common European Interest) on Microelectronics** is
currently in the pre-notifications phase in 20 participating EU Member States and the

notification phase by the EU Commission. Its main objective is to invest in Innovative
industrial capacities such as “critical raw materials, equipment, wafers, research, preproduction and design to support Europe’s leadership in critical supply gaps and enabling

innovation” [20]. This activity is related to the EU Chips Act to reduce dependencies and to
improve resilience in areas like processors for high-performance computing, specialised

chips for AI and autonomous driving. Worth mentioning is the ambition to develop a panEuropean chips design ecosystem to tackle the new challenges on transistors in a more
than Moore approach, and on circuits architectures with increased security and
trustworthiness. From the SNS perspective, a cooperation on requirements on 5G and 6G

systems towards research and design on necessary future microelectronics components is
envisaged to improve the European resilience. Moreover, it would be beneficial to identify

similar synergies with national initiatives from Member States.


“ **The European Chips Act,** adopted by the Commission early 2022 aims to enhance Europe’s
competitiveness and resilience in microelectronics technologies and applications, and help
achieve both the digital and green transition. One of its objectives is to help Europe reach
leadership in chips for digital connectivity infrastructures. Europe has a leading position in

the global connectivity infrastructure market, while at the same time has strong
dependencies on chipset vendors from outside the European Union. EU will mobilise more
than € 43 billion of public and private investments and set measures to prepare, anticipate

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


and swiftly respond to any future supply chain disruptions, together with Member States and
EU international partners. The aim is to (i) Strengthen Europe’s research and technology

sovereignty towards smaller and faster chips, (ii) Put in place a framework to increase
production capacity to 20% of the global market by 2030, (iii) Build and reinforce capacity
to innovate in the design, manufacturing and packaging of advanced chips, (iv) Develop
an in-depth understanding of the global semiconductor supply chains and (v) Address the
skills shortage, attract new talent and support the emergence of a skilled workforce.


Entering the SNS era, the **SNS R&I Work Programme 2021 – 2022** [21] is contributing to
European policies including microelectronic components and is providing preliminary
activities in areas related to green radio technologies, wireless communication and signal
processing, communication infrastructure technologies and devices and experimental

infrastructures. In the SNS Work Programme 2023 – 2024 activities on microelectronics are
extended according to [22] based on established European policies such as the European

Chips Act (Microelectronic components).


A number of joint **activities between the KDT/European Chips Act and SNS** JUs are
envisaged in their respective Work Programmes, with both constituencies being
encouraged to participate in such calls. In particular, the SNS Joint Undertaking Work
Programme for 2023-2024 includes strand “SNS-2023-STREAM-B-01-05: Microelectronics
based Solutions for 6G Networks” and strand “SNS-2024-STREAM-C-01-01: SNS
Microelectronics Lighthouse” that aim to develop an experimental platform where solutions
from the micro-electronics domain developed either in the context of Phase 1 SNS WP, or
Horizon Europe Cluster 4, or the KDT JU will be validated in terms of performance and
applicability for 6G networks. Therefore, solutions developed in projects funded under the
current KDT focus topic could find their way into the afore-mentioned SNS topic.


The SNS JU is also monitoring and **strengthening its links with the closely related area of**
**photonics** . In the SRIA of Photonics21 for 2025 onwards (currently under development) it is

clearly mentioned that cooperation should be strengthened as the SNS JU is working from
network and system level downwards, whereas Photonics21 works from device and subsystem level upwards. Potential areas of cooperation are optical wireless communication,

advanced optical transmitter and receiver technology, next generation Terabit/s

transceivers, optical switching systems, photonic integration as a combination of optical,
radio frequency and digital radio systems and highly linear optical modulators or fronthaul
and backhaul systems. Activities in the SNS JU and the 6G-IA can derive important

component and device requirements and can provide relevant test environments for
prototype devices resulting from Phototonics21 developments. A close collaboration

ensures that network, system, and component developments go hand-in-hand. Meanwhile,
it would be worthwhile for the SNS JU and Photonics 21 to synchronize their activities for a
holistic approach necessary to reduce the environmental impact of next-generation
networks, encompassing four research pillars: energy-efficient hardware, energy-efficient
software, energy-aware network planning, and sustainable operation of the network

infrastructure.


It Is worth noting that the **NetworldEurope** has recently provided a SRIA [23] and an
accompanying technical oriented Annex [24] that provide a detailed analysis of all


Dissemination level: Public | **11**


6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


technical topics related to 6G networks including topics related to devices, microelectronics and optical networks. The document also provides detailed lists of research

challenges in the short-, medium- and long-term timeline. This document, along with the
corresponding SRIAs from of the Electronic Components & Systems and Photonics21 should
be analysed in a cooperative way among the involved communities and funding
instruments to investigate and identify how the research directions and eventually results
to be produced can be synchronized to achieve multiplier effects.


If used correctly, the above-mentioned instruments could act as the catalyst to bring
together research and innovation European resources to contribute towards technological
sovereignty in the areas of components, optical communication, and micro-electronics for
6G connectivity. The knowledge and skills to be created, will help boosting the European

market and reduce dependencies from other regions.




### **2.2. OPEN SNS SOLUTIONS**

Open networks are networks built based on open, standard-based and programmable

architectures requiring the integration of various data sources and services into unified and

automated platforms. Open networks solutions should be developed adhering to the World

Trade Organization (WTO) Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement (TBT) upon which the EU

Standards 1025 directive is built on, like in today’s well-established principles and

procedures of international standardization.

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


Open networks, refer to open interfaces as well open network function definition. They both

target for a hardware and software disaggregation that is part of the network evolution

already reflected in market developments during 2022-2023. Open networks expect to bring

the following benefits:


  - More choices for operators and manufacturers to mix and match components from

different vendors thus diversifying their dependencies. The realization of this diversity

opportunity is also dependent on available choices and market concentration in up
stream markets e.g., virtualization software, semiconductors, etc.

  - Greater automation and flexibility for operational efficiency in network roll-out,

  - New possibilities for innovation,

  - New opportunities for European market players. (e.g., near real-time (xApps) and

non-real-time (rApps) applications)

  - Using cloudification, disaggregation and modularization as enablers for simpler

network operation and management and hardware reuse capability when replacing

SW or HW vendors.


Open networks are currently investigated as a promising solution to support the constantly

growing data traffic and the need for network densification, in a TCO (Total Cost of

Ownership) optimized way. The development of open networks is a complex topic and there

are important issues to be considered to the envisioned solutions. An indicative list includes:


  - Higher integration complexity that renders configuration, operation and update a

challenging process, while performance is not always easily met, resulting in that the
TCO promise is yet to be proven (shifting Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) to
Operational Expenditures (OPEX))

  - An increased threat vector for the overall security potentially leading to more
vulnerability in the networks that needs to be investigated and mitigated,

  - Use of Open RAN architecture (e.g., O-RAN) does not mean not using proprietary

components e.g., for Distributed Units (Dus) and Radio Units (Rus). Open Interfaces
in O-RAN architecture may be realized by manufactures using proprietary software.
Confusion remains between open source and open interfaces/architecture and

more work is needed to clarify the possibilities and expectations, especially on open
source software and whitebox solutions

  - Over-standardization of networks carries the risk of reducing the perspective of
opportunities for innovation on top of network solutions,

  - Energy efficiency is not easy to achieve when integrating software and hardware
products from various sources,

  - Without careful planning and well-balanced solutions, these approaches may end
up only replacing a strong European sector by non-European solutions that will

threaten the desired European technological sovereignty.

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


Today, open networks appear to be a significant trend where multiple stakeholders at a
global level are working hard to achieve the aforementioned benefits and address the

aforementioned issues. Although no one could safely claim today where these efforts will
lead, this area clearly has potential and should therefore be considered in current and future
European research activities.


All the latest findings suggest that more effort is needed to better understand the pros and

cons and find the right balance between open and purpose-built solutions, as well as gain

further understanding over the depth of the promise that open networks can bring. Already

in the first R&I Work Programmes of the SNS JU related activities have been planned both in

long term research topics as well as in experimental platforms [21], [22].


However, additional research and innovation efforts and additional accessible experimental

platforms are needed to reach widely accepted and well-balanced solutions. The following

set of recommendations captures the key points for the way forward.

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services

### **2.3. CLOUDIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTED** **COMPUTING**


Cloud infrastructures will play a crucial role in 6G. Already in the 5G era, applications are
implemented in the cloud. With 6G this phenomenon will intensify using a cloud continuum
from space cloud to terrestrial cloud and edge networks. In the 6G era applications will be

implemented on cloud infrastructures, while the core and access networks will be cloud
ready as well. One of the envisioned challenges is to come up with solutions that will run
network functions in the cloud in the most energy efficient way.

Cloud infrastructures do not offer only storage but claim to offer best in class operational
automation and AI/ML based optimisation and use cases, commonly purpose built (c.f.,

section 2.2 and 2.4). It is worth noting that there are still some challenges on cloudification,
integration and lifecycle management.


In the case where both application providers outsource the hosting of their applications,
and telecommunications operators outsource the hosting of their networks to cloud
providers, there is a risk of a chain dependency. In addition, resilience is at risk. It may be
that multiple telecommunication network providers and applications (e.g., an electricity

distribution company) use the same cloud provider. If this cloud provider suffers from an
outage, there will be widespread outages of digital infrastructures.

A way to address the dependency on cloud Infrastructures is to ensure Interoperability
between cloud infrastructures. That way it is possible to have different independent cloud
infrastructures that are separately optimised for a specific task or market. For example,

there can be cloud infrastructures that are optimised for high-speed media/data
processing in a telecommunications network; cloud infrastructures that are optimised for
computing, edge/cloud infrastructures that are distributed to be nearby the end-users; or

private cloud infrastructures implemented at factory premises. Such standardized
interoperability can be used to further enhance the resilience for a specific market segment
where more than one cloud operator could offer their solutions to specific customers.

Technology development should address interfaces for cloud interoperability and should

cater for specific performance optimization of cloud infrastructures for the transport of 6G
user data in radio access and core.


During the development of 6G technology, it is important to take cloud sovereignty into
account. This includes control and storage of data that will be under domains that are

controlled or conform to EU jurisdiction and legislation. There are currently concerns in
Europe about the low footprint on the provision of cloud infrastructures. From the
perspective of sovereignty and diversification, the current situation is sub-optimal. This has
pushed the EU and Member States to take measures aimed to reduce this dependency (e.g.,
GAIA-X[25], IPCEI-CIS [26]) . Additionally, in the context of the Horizon Europe, the European
High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking is targeted to provide secure cloud-based

supercomputing services for a wide-range of public and private-users everywhere in
Europe [27].

Very recently, the Sylva Open Source project [28] was started by five European telcos in
collaboration with the main European vendors and under the auspices of the Linux

Foundation Europe [29]. According to their white paper [28], the Sylva project has two main
objectives:

1. To release a cloud software framework, which shall:

    - Identify and prioritise telco and edge requirements,


    - Develop solutions to the specific technical challenges identified on the
infrastructure layer of the telco ecosystem,

    - Integrate these solutions with existing open-source components,

    - These solutions and the integrated cloud software framework are not

“production ready” software, but aims to be “production grade” in order to be

used by third parties such as operators, network function vendors, and cloud
providers to create commercial products,


2. To develop a reference implementation of this cloud software framework and create

an integration and validation program to:

    - Validate the commercial network functions against this cloud software

framework,

    - Validate implementations based on the released framework and its
components,

    - Accelerate commercial adoption of network functions and their compliance with
this cloud software framework.


According to the Sylva project FAQ [30], the first commits are expected in 2023. A first version
of the cloud framework is expected to be released in mid-2023.

### **2.4. NETWORK INTELLIGENCE**


It is widely accepted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be of paramount importance in 6G
networks connecting human, physical and digital worlds ([31], [32]) and may be a huge
opportunity to provide advanced AI based services using network supported functions
and/or network generated data. As presented in [33], AI and ML (Machine Learning) will be
an integral part of the system network architecture with AI services and applications being

highly intelligent and autonomous. As shown in Figure 2, AI and ML are expected to assist in
almost all technological areas of operation of 6G networks. To secure AI systems throughout
the entire machine learning lifecycle, confidentiality, integrity and availability must be
ensured to keep the model confidential and secure. In addition, AI systems should be
designed to preserve data privacy.


AI, digital twins and other intelligent components will also be an integral part of services and
applications that will need to be supported by 6G infrastructures. In turn, they will also be

supported via native AI parts of the 6G network. Many of these intelligent components will
be provided within the 6G infrastructure (e.g., they are provided on edge locations or require
specific network support). To allow interconnection and interoperation of intelligent
components across different stakeholders, open solutions and carefully selected

standardised interfaces are needed.

This reality has been captured from the beginning in the preparation of the SNS JU proposal

[1] and in the subsequent SNS JU Work Programmes [21], [22]. In the context of the SNS JU,

AI/ML solutions have already been identified in various streams ranging from long-term

research activities to experimental platforms and large-scale trials. Notably in the _HORIZON-_

_JU-SNS-2023-STREAM-B-01-06: EU-US 6G R&I Cooperation AI solutions_ and the _HORIZON-_

may be considered at various levels from a future target 6G system, from lower layer radio

aspects to higher layers targeting intelligent function placement, network self
configuration, security and resilience, or AI based support of user applications. This call also

targets the support to a reference framework for AI usage for the telecommunications

domain in relation to 6G, including methodologies, reference use cases, data acquisition

and generation, repositories, curated training and evaluation data, as well as the

technologies and functionalities needed to use it as a benchmarking platform for future

AI/ML solutions for 6G networks.


At the same time, a significant number of global research efforts as well as related
standardization activities are progressing to provide results for Beyond 5G and eventually
6G systems. A comprehensive survey can be found at [34], where a detailed analysis of 5G

PPP activities is presented, together with a summary of standardization activities, a list of
open issues and a set of recommendations.


Based on the findings of the aforementioned white paper and the previous analysis it is clear
that for enhancing future network return of investment the following areas need further
attention (research and development work):

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services

### **2.5. SECURITY AND PRIVACY**


Security is one of the first fundamental rights [35] and a pre-requisite for strategic
autonomy as a policy objective of the European Union in a cyber-physical world. The
economies’ reliance on digital infrastructures drives stringent requirements on our ability to

ensure secured development, including relevant supply chains, deployment and operations
of 6G technologies and reducing Europe’s overall strategic dependencies. There is a direct
relationship between the ability to provide and master the technologies along their full life
cycle and the implementation of security policies. Those policies are in turn the enablers for

conformance with regional values and legal framework.


The European Union is leading the perspective of a global resilient human-centric digital
era and develops positions and policies for that purpose (e.g., NIS2, CRA, AI act, etc. [36] –

[40]). This may be an opportunity to leverage better resilience for the entire society
including critical vertical sectors and better chances for societal acceptance with respect
of fundamental values such as privacy. The recent General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) experience shows that while fragmentation of legislations and standards between

regions are in general detrimental for the industry, well-defined policies can be beneficial,
showing digital maturity and gaining global momentum.


Beyond mandatory “by design” approaches for each and every component of the 6G
architectures the intrinsic dynamic End-to-End nature of security mandates to address its
complex time and space dimensions/challenges with a holistic view. Below we analyse 4

main pillars related to security and privacy.


**A.** **Identification of threats**


Threats – thus the strategic impacts – are the combination of the expected security level,
sophistication of malicious attacks, attack surface/vulnerabilities of the technologies,

systems and services and remediation capabilities. Ongoing European cooperation with
ENISA on 5G (threat landscape [41], Tool box [42]) may be extended with a **6G-dedicated**

**cooperative European Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** . Joining public and private forces
(Computer Emergency Response Team – CERT, Computer Security Incident Response Team

- CSIRT, Security Operating Centre – SOC), on multiple technological areas such as security,

telecom, cloud, IoT, space, etc.is key to distribute and share security knowledge among the

wider stakeholder landscape. One of the virtuous consequences of such an approach will
be to anticipate at this stage the applicability of European policies.


Europe should be able to provide solutions that will conform to the European legislation. As
identified in section 2.3, Europe needs to have a clear strategy for cloud services. Towards
this end, activities considering open-source building blocks used for a cloud continuum

infrastructure (from far edge to hyperscalers) appear to be a promising answer for

European stakeholders.


Dissemination level: Public | **19**


6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


A second wide area policy-related field is the evaluation & monitoring of security conditions
where past approaches of certification (already complex to unify) are even more

challenging considering flexibility of the systems and distribution of control/liability
perimeters.


**B.** **Protection**


Policies about protection encompass multiple angles of 6G. In this context, the definition of

sovereignty provided in Section 2 of this document applies, which emphasizes that the
definition of sovereignty and its realisation does not include (1) autarky (or protectionism)
and (2) heteronomy. Focusing on policy-dependent items we can list:

  - Data centric issues: confidentiality, privacy, cryptographic requirements (Post
Quantum Cryptography), localisation of storage, processing, applicability of legal
framework, root of trustable AI, etc. 6G is about communication but also about inter
computing connectivity and can’t be agnostic to these issues. One can differentiate
at least three types of data, namely: a) users’ payloads, b) 6G control and

management data, c) behavioural/localisation extracted data from 6G systems and
services usage.

  - Hardware and software components: It may be worth here to give a focus on supply
chains as explained in section 2.1. The goal for Europe should be to ensure that

blocking should not occur in the supply chain which is a dependency chain, nor there
should be question marks on the certification of hardware products. Specific
attention to HW/SW security functions/components is key to master the 6G
infrastructure and services.

  - Software defined operations: Security is a living matter which must follow the

variance of the system, the software defined operation must be done both in a
resilient way respectful of requested policies. With an immediate impact on liabilities,
transparency and forensic may be considered as part of the new challenges. It is

also an area where **integration of security Services** (Managed Security Service
Provider – MSSP) should globally benefit to all players.

  - End-to-end solutions: Finally, 6G will accelerate the service dimension. Here, linked

to evaluation challenges, the goal should be exposure of security attributes
qualifying sub-systems and (micro)service components. This is a challenge to

**enable End-to-End service composition and Users’ awareness of Digital usages** .

**C.** **Detection & Response**


Smart counter measures against attacks obviously mandate to detect the attacks.

  - Means to detect (e.g., Extended Detection and Response – xDR functions) should be
generalized or even mandatory (this is already the case in some regions) for
essential services.

  - Contamination or just correlation of attacks leads to a need of cooperative
approaches. Although linked to the CTI proposal above, collaborative structures may

be developed for the wide 6G communities, from basic 6G service users, verticals

and Non-Public Networks users, up to large telcos and service providers.

**D.** **Resilience and Recovery**


The last phase of Cyber security, recovery, has many aspects related to resilience. Learning
from experience, feeding the CTI, improving process and remediation, is coming in addition
to previous statements at a different time scale but claiming for continuous 6G security.
Challenges raised by 6G technologies and its expected contribution to societal and
economic dimensions mandates to master its security and privacy. Based on a valuable

policy maturity, our industry has an opportunity to drive 6G for the better, enable its trustable
development/deployment and generate subsequent growth.

It is worth noting that NetworldEurope has identified a detailed list of topics for further
research and innovation activities [24]. Moreover, the Smart Networks and Services has
already defined the necessary axis aiming at contributing to the numerous challenges’

solutions [21], [22].




### **2.6. SNS KNOWLEDGE BASE & SKILLS**

As mentioned in [43], “Europe is lagging behind with its digital talent in the current scenario”

while [44] clearly mentions: “The EU’s 9 million ICT specialists also fall well short of the EU aim
of 20 million specialists by 2030 and are not enough to address the skills shortages that
businesses, SMEs and organisations are now experiencing, despite the fact that 500.000 ICT
specialists entered the labour market between 2020 and 2021.

The 2022 results demonstrate that while the majority of Member States are making progress

in their digital transformation, essential digital technologies like AI and Big Data are still not
widely used by enterprises. The deployment of connection infrastructure, particularly 5G,
which is necessary for highly innovative services and applications, must come quickly.”

Moreover, it is important to promote equality, diversity and a gender balanced approach in
the 6G R&I community and working environment. Women need to be encouraged joining

into technical and engineering studies and actively participate in the European 6G R&I
community, as currently the sector is missing a significant part of experts.

The EC has recognized the Importance of creating a knowledge base and takes measures
towards addressing these challenges for Europe [45]. Thus, there are possibilities through a
coherent Horizon Europe Programme to stimulate the creation of appropriate actions that

will enable European talents to build their skills on key 6G technologies (e.g., AI/ML,
cybersecurity, IoT, advanced RAN, transport and core connectivity solutions, etc.).

The 6G-IA has already mobilized a critical mass of European stakeholders that are active
working in innovative 6G solutions for smart networks and services. Also, At the same time
the SNS JU is offering a unique opportunity to create a 6G SNS knowledge basis supported

by a plethora of experts. Thus, it will be of paramount importance to come up with concrete
steps to take advantage of such opportunities and integrate them with the European
educational framework.


Finally, Women in Telecommunications and Research (WiTaR) is an EU-level initiative that
promotes gender equality, inclusion and empowerment in the 6G Research & Innovation
(R&I) community. This initiative was originally established by Hexa-X as Women in Hexa-X

initiative in February 2021 and then it was expanded for the participations of the whole 5G
PPP community in June 2021. Currently, this initiative operates as a 6G-IA WG.


1. Ensure that the generated knowledge becomes an integral part of the curricula

in Europe, starting with the SNS calls from 2025,

2. Collect the generated knowledge on 6G smart networks and services and

make it widely available for European experts in life-long learning activities

3. Stimulate and motivate 6G-IA members to support the skills development

through open lectures on key topics.

## **3. TARGETING SUSTAINABILITY**


In 1987, the United Nations’ Brundtland [46] report defined sustainability as “ _**meeting the**_
_**needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their**_
_**own needs [47]**_ .” Today, worldwide efforts are seeking ways of meeting their development
needs, but with the increasing threat of climate change, concrete efforts must be made to
ensure development today does not negatively affect future generations.


Sustainability is a societal goal that is usually addressed under three pillars, namely
environmental, economic and social. A related concept that many times is used as a
synonym is that of the sustainable development. The UN SDGs refer to the pathways and

needed action to achieve the long-term target of sustainability.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the related UN SDGs [48] aim to

strengthen the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable
development. Beyond these objectives reinforced by the European Green Deal [49], which

sets out a target for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, research on Smart Network
and Services needs to address how 6G will be sustainable and how it will contribute to the
sustainability of other sectors.


Sustainability is increasingly becoming a key target for the design of 6G, driving the choice
of technologies and conception of the system to reach effective 6G solutions, with reduced
environmental impact. Sustainability per se is a worthwhile target. However, the challenge
is how to move from slogans into concrete actions to make it happen.

The European Green Deal [50] provides a roadmap for making the European economy

sustainable by turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities across all
policy areas and making the transition just and inclusive for all.


While the main ambition is to ensure that Europe will be the first climate-neutral continent

by 2050, the set of target objectives aims on developing and ensuring a _“new growth_

_strategy to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-_

_efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases_

_in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use”._


For attaining the sustainability goals of the Green Deal in many different sectors, the EC has
anticipated the need to invest on digital technologies such as **Artificial Intelligence, 5G and**
**6G, Internet of Things, Cloud and Edge computing** . Such technologies offer new

opportunities for effective sustainable solutions. At the same time, the Green Deal underlines
also the need to investigate and invest in ICT technologies that are more sustainable
(greener / more energy and climate friendly) by design.

Recognizing the need for sustainability the SNS JU has acknowledged the work currently
performed under the 5G PPP Initiative [51] and has identified related topics in various

streams and strands in the SNS JU [21], [22]. Moreover, there is already a plan to organize a
call for a sustainability lighthouse project that will bring the multiple solutions together and
provide a clear European answer for sustainability.

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


The work covers both “Sustainable 6G” and “6G for sustainability”. It includes identification
and developments of the technology/architectures needed to make 6G solutions (end-to
end) sustainable. “Sustainable 6G” and “6G for sustainability” should be considered with
equal importance. Sustainability will be considered through three dimensions: (i)
environmental sustainability, targeting the minimisation of environmental impact; (ii)
societal sustainability, aiming at providing value to people and society thanks to new use
cases powered by 6G, and (iii) economic sustainability, where 6G will be an enabler for
business value. This threefold approach will drive the design and integration of technical

solutions into an end-end sustainable set of tools and solutions. These three dimensions are
briefly analysed in the following subsections.
### **3.1. ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY**


As mentioned in [52], “there is a growing public awareness of environmental sustainability
and the impact of technologies on energy consumption and usage of natural resources.

Regulators are addressing the carbon footprint of networks and their related usages”. The
document provides references to several activities taking place in Europe both at national
and EC level.


In the framework of 6G networks, the environmental sustainability aims to minimize the
environmental impact, i.e., to reduce the consumed energy and the carbon footprint of
manufacturing and operation of 6G networks but also to decrease the environmental
impact of other industries (textile, automotive, food, pharmaceutical, etc.) by enabling
disruptive services to digitalize and optimize processes. In other words, 6G should cater for
sustainable 6G networks as well as 6G for sustainability on all sectors that it will be used.


Possible key sustainability objectives are (1) the specification of applicable environmental
sustainability indicators, (2) methods for evaluation and (3) their application and use to
connectivity solutions, including 6G. One approach that is expected to be followed in this

context, is the calculation of the net avoided emissions in the industrial sectors when ICT is
used. Globally accepted indicators and models for environmental sustainability should be

developed for connectivity solutions including 6G. Specific recommendations and an
overview on methodologies for assessing Carbon Footprint are provided, e.g., in [53].


To address sustainability requirements, research on future networks and services needs to
be driven by environmental-related targets which notably embrace technology energy
efficiency, sustainable services and equipment including terminals, and end to end CO2

reduction in the entire value chain [54].


Large efforts must be invested buy all parts of the ecosystem. Industrial stakeholders need
to reduce their carbon footprint by extending the hardware lifetime (while implementing
modularity and reparability) and by including efficient transportation and recycling
processes in their products. They should also find ways to minimize the energy consumption
in their operations. Service providers aim to implement new sustainable connectivity

technologies, extending infrastructure sharing principles, enhancing services for energy
free devices [55], or even streamlining network traffic and limiting electromagnetic field
exposure.


Dissemination level: Public | **24**


6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


The challenge is that 6G aims to support enhanced services (internet of senses, immersive
environments XR/VR, digital twins, holographic type communications, smarts homes and

cities) requiring huge data rates while reducing the required total energy per transmitted
bit. In fact, due to the expected traffic growth, decreasing energy consumption is very
ambitious, even when previous generations have showed that energy is reduced by a factor
of 10 at each evolution. In 6G, when considering the capacity gain, the goal is to find the
required trade-off and balance between performance and sustainability goals.


Since a low environmental impact relies on minimizing both consumed energy and emitted
CO2 during operation of 6G networks but also during the lifecycle of network equipment and
terminals (from raw material, manufacturing, transportation, maintenance, up to recycling
in end of life), automating energy consumption optimization will likely become mandatory

in all network segments and during every stage of 6G lifecycle. Automation can be achieved
by a smart closed loop which includes monitoring, AI-based analytics techniques, and

modification actions to fulfil the required performance and energy consumption
requirements without impacting the quality of service. Techniques to reach zero

consumption at zero load (when no data is transmitted) need to be investigated for each
6G physical or virtual component. 6G needs to go beyond advanced sleep modes of radio
access units and to implement auto-optimized smart components in terms of energy
throughout the end-to-end network.


Besides energy optimization, resource sharing principles could be also investigated in 6G,
including research activities to identify additional sustainable solutions. Embedded
resource sharing functions are challenging when conceiving new 6G components and
protocols. The sharing principles which can be applied at all layers include both hardware
and software components, and give rise to new actors, for instance tower companies, cloud

owners, among others; the target is to extend capacity but not the equipment. Multioperator or even multi-actor (including cloud industries, IoT dedicated companies, private
network owners, etc.) platforms and networks particularly require advanced end-to-end

management and orchestration mechanisms. When various actors are involved in an endto-end service, trust aspects need to be addressed to guarantee the required quality of
service for users, thus, specific trust mechanisms need to be envisaged to enable sharing

agreements between the parts or even the implementation of a dynamic marketplace. (A
trustfulness model based on distributed ledger technology is proposed in [56]).

An energy-aware approach relies also on both access agnostic and hardware agnostic
networks. Enabling transparent handover among WiFi-based, satellite-based, or 6G-based

access networks can significantly optimize energy consumption while increasing resilience

and coverage. For example, handover can be performed under both “best connection” and
“energy efficiency” principles. Better network performance can also contribute to optimal
battery consumption in terminals. Moreover, instantiating cloud-native network functions
on commercial off-the-shelf servers appears to offer some promising solutions for the
implementation of sharing principles as well as to avoid manufacturing and deploying
dedicated hardware, which shall contribute to sustainable 6G networks.


As mentioned earlier, striving for environmental sustainability may have conflicting goals
compared to those of other sustainable pillars and technological sovereignty targets. For

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


example, there are arguments that optimizing for cost in terms of open/multi-vendor/multiactor networks and optimizing for other values such as energy performance could be a

challenge as an open cloud native network may consume more energy. This is why more
research and innovation activities are needed to draw concrete results and ensure that the
best-balanced solutions will be eventually followed by the industry.
### **3.2. SOCIETAL SUSTAINABILITY**


Societal sustainability is of prime importance to several UN SDGs. It encompasses several
areas such as safety, security, trustworthiness, and inclusiveness. As mentioned in [52],
“societal requirements should be considered with equal importance as performance
requirements”. Societal requirements may include higher EMF-awareness, higher digital
inclusion (with improved affordability, coverage of low-density areas), higher security and

much higher resilience.

What is still missing, is a well-defined framework that will assist a proper and concrete

methodology to evaluate 6G solutions and how these contribute to fulfilling societal
requirements. A possible way forward to address this challenge is described in section 3.4.

Research activities to provide solutions for societal sustainability are required. The SNS JU

has recognized this fact and has integrated this priority in the SNS R&I WPs [21], [22].
Currently a dedicated call for sustainability is being designed in the context of _HORIZON-JU-_
_SNS-2024-STREAM-B-01-07: Sustainability_ by providing among other things societal
sustainability, aiming at providing value to people and society thanks to new use cases
powered by 6G. Moreover, the call on _HORIZON-JU-SNS-2023-STREAM-CSA-01: SNS Societal_
_Challenges_ is targeting to identify why society needs 6G solutions and consider the

acceptability of a new 6G technological wave, as well as potential effects at societal and
environmental levels and on public health.


These policy objectives are a clear direction for the European stakeholders to work on
solutions that will address societal needs along the typical and well-needed technological
breakthroughs.
### **3.3. ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY**


The telecom sector is vital for the European economy and pivotal for the green and digital

transition. The sector generated 4,5% of European GDP (2021) with a contribution amounting

to 760 B€ of economic value added, supports 2,6 million of jobs and produces 109B€ of

public funding (taxes). It is expected that by 2025 the telecom sector will add 840B€ of

economic value and 20 million new mobile internet subscribers [57], [58].


540B€ of economic value added are productivity gains that will be further boosted based
on the needs from verticals that require smart network and services as a flexible

“connectivity platform” that will operate as an integral part of their business process. The

challenge for Europe is to mobilize the critical mass of stakeholders to support this business

transformation, avoid fragmentation and enable early adoption of solutions, filling the gap
of 5G coverage with respect to other regions of the world and enabling a fast take off for 6G

in 2030.


At the same time the telecommunication market is facing its own challenges. The European
telecom sector has invested 500 B€ [59] in the last 10 years and will need 42B€ of additional
investment (on top of private expected investments) per year to reach 2030 Digital Decade
targets [60]. To trigger additional private investments, the policy measures, established 20
30 years ago in a very different socio-economic environment, are now being revisited
encompassing different dimensions.

Towards this end research and innovation activities for 6G networks should focus on

solutions like adequate support for network cloudification and fostering distributed
computing infrastructures for Europe. Moreover, innovative frameworks that will enable cost

reduction and simplification of network and services deployment [61] need to be developed.
These frameworks should offer innovative solutions in areas that are desirable to make 6G

technologies more acceptable by the public (e.g., EMF).

Technological breakthroughs are needed to support supply-chain diversity to improve
network security and resilience by finding the right balance between disaggregation and

greater interoperability while ensuring network performance, high level of security and
sustainable levels of energy consumption.

Finally, new policy frameworks are needed that will boost the regulatory authorities to
simplify deployment by considering reasonable spectrum licencing conditions, fair
allocation of costs for network traffic and ways to stimulate data-driven technologies and
services [62].
### **3.4. KEY VALUES INDICATORS**


As mentioned in the previous sections, 6G should be designed not only for performance but

to have a positive impact on societal values, and most critically for sustainability. Ambitions

related to societal values point at the need to consider value-related goals and expected

impact, which can be assessed with Key Value Indicators (KVIs) in relation to the usage of

6G networks. This value-related view should complement performance-related capabilities,

assessed with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in relation to the design of 6G networks.

Currently, at a global level an agreed framework to evaluate KVIs is not in place. Without

such a framework it will be impossible to properly compare technological solutions and

reach a unique set of standardized solutions.


The use of KVIs Is a tool to demonstrate the value impact of technology and how societal

challenges are addressed. Value-related goals and expected impact need to be defined in

a way that clarifies their relation to specific values, considering the enabled effect and

design of 6G networks.

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


Key Values (KVs) are values important to people and society that may be directly addressed

or indirectly impacted by future network technology, and to specifically be considered for

6G. The UN SDGs provide a well-established framework for societal needs and values, which

serve as a good starting point in covering economic, societal, and environmental

sustainability. In addition to the UN SDGs, values such as privacy, digital inclusion, and trust

should be highlighted.


A KVI should be a measurable quantity that in some form provides an estimate of an

affected KV. The formulation of KVIs should be done together with experts in the relevant

field to ensure their relevance. Evaluation of KVIs can be done in several steps: a first-guess

assessment, an assessment through expert consultation/user panels; simulation /

emulation; and finally, a measurement/evaluation after deployment of the use case.


_Figure 3: KVI analysis based on Use cases_


KVs and KVIs are related to the usage and proliferation of network technology through use

cases and is a societal value-based complement to the performance-based development

[63]. This is illustrated in Figure 3.


As is discussed above, it is useful to make a distinction between Sustainable 6G (direct

sustainability impact) and 6G for sustainability (the enabled effect from network usage).

Sustainable 6G can be assessed in terms of KPIs, e.g.:


  - Energy consumption of networks


Dissemination level: Public | **28**


6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


  - Resource usage (materials) for networks hardware, e.g., measured as CO2
equivalents


To understand the enabled sustainability of 6G networks, 6G for sustainability, one needs to

study the impact on use cases that are relevant for the values represented by the SDGs and

other KVs. This impact should be estimated with quantitative measures (KVIs) that are both

relevant for the KV in question and relevant for 6G network usage. Formulation should be

done in a collaborative effort between experts in the value domain and in the telco domain.

Some examples of this approach are given in Table 2.


_Table 2: Key values mapped to use case areas and related KVIs_




















|Use case area|KV examples|KVI examples|
|---|---|---|
|**Emergency**<br>**response &**<br>**warning**<br>**systems**|**_Societal_**<br>**_sustainability_**|_Reduced emergency response times; Increased operational_<br>_efficiency of interventions in remote areas_|

|**Sustainable**<br>**food**<br>**production**|**_Societal_**<br>**_sustainability_**|_Increase in agriculture productivity; Reliability of food_<br>_production_|



Concretely, the KVIs will be a comparison between the impact without 6G and the impact

with 6G. Given the high uncertainties involved, the impact can be labelled e.g., as “low” (<10%

impact on a KVI), “medium” (10-50% impact on a KVI), and “high” (>50% impact on a KVI).

The outcome of a KVI analysis should then be a score list of expected value impact per use

case. This KVI score adds another perspective to the performance score, and a possible

trade-off between the two perspectives can then be discussed.




## **4. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS**

This document provides a comprehensive set of key strategies for 6G smart networks and
services, capturing the views and priorities from the members of 6G-IA. The focus of the first

version of this document was on specific aspects for technological sovereignty and
sustainability. The goal was not to include a complete list of topics but kick-off the
discussion on several important topics related to the development of 6G smart networks

and services. Already it offers concrete recommendations on the various areas and how
these can be implemented through 6G-IA actions and considered for inclusion on future
versions of the SNS JU SRIA and R&I Work Programmes.


To complement this, and anticipate further work and position development, the implications

of the above-mentioned stated policy directions will be further investigated. In particular,
the implications on the service provider ecosystems will be addressed. At this stage we
merely observe that the public communication service providers (aka. Telcos) are today

offering fundamental public communication services founded in interoperable and

federated multi-stakeholder platform ecosystem capabilities (built upon public
interconnected networks and services). These offerings have not been substantially evolved
over the last couple of decades. The so-called Telco Voice, SMS/MMS, and the Internet
Access Service for best-effort Internet connectivity remains as the fundamental service
offerings and the inherently interoperable multi-stakeholder platform capabilities have
been from this high-level perspective rested at a status quo. The reasons for this are multi
faceted and deserve more attention. On the contrary, there have been huge developments

of single stakeholder platform ecosystems and offerings, including a vast portfolio of

6G-IA Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services


Internet applications enabled by the above communications platforms.


Hence, in the further work and policy position development the potential evolution of such
multi-stakeholder platform ecosystems will be addressed. We anticipate several main
areas of further innovations and developments that all will require open, standardized APIs
and “as a Service” thinking, to enable efficient and automated inter-operator interaction
and new service offerings. This will be both at the wholesale and the retail level, and from a
local and national level as well as at the international level. The anticipated directions will

likely consider separation and interaction between the main “layers” briefly identified in the
current document as infrastructure, connectivity, compute, and application layers. However,
the further development of such multi-stakeholder platform offerings are significantly
harder than the cases of single-stakeholder platforms. Further developments of multi
stakeholder platforms are more complex and require multi-stakeholder alignment and
incentive compatible solutions and business models. Supporting policies will be important

to move such service provider ecosystems forward.
