feedback: We need more focus on innovative chip technologies in which Europe has a
  clear advantage (for example novel photonic chips, not based on silicon). Less focus
  on chip technologies in which Europe would only be attempting to catch-up to others
  far ahead. The most crucial issue is however on the funding side. Without a stronger
  financial market to provide venture capital, truly high-potential, disruptive companies
  and technologies will continue to end up in ownership outside of Europe.
