feedback: Open topic calls should remain for both RIA & IA. In case focus topic calls
  will be launched they should be opened 6months before the deadline (3 months is
  not enough). Lab2Fab kind of initiatives should be open also for associated states.
  SRIA can be broad as it is today but there should be also a short summary of strategic
  topics. Sustainability should be present (PFAS, repairability, ultra-low energy,
  reuse...). Semiconductor topic should be open for like-minded countries.
