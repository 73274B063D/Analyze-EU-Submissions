## **Executive Summary**

**Europe's semiconductor strategy should shift from pursuing manufacturing autonomy to**
**becoming an irreplaceable partner in the global value chain.** The 2023 Act's ambition to
reach 20% of global chip production was a reasonable response to the supply chain
disruptions of 2020-2022, but the threat landscape has fundamentally changed. With
targets increasingly out of reach and the required investment prohibitively large, Europe
cannot win a subsidy race against the US and China. More importantly, chip access is now
threatened predominantly by deliberate geopolitical restrictions rather than accidental
disruptions. A strategy built around manufacturing capacity cannot address a world where
semiconductors have become instruments of economic leverage. Europe must adapt
accordingly. Strategic indispensability offers a more effective path. Europe already holds
critical chokepoints in the global supply chain. By ensuring the global supply chain remains
dependent on European technology, the EU ensures that partners and rivals alike have a
strategic interest in maintaining Europe's access to their chips—securing access to all
advanced chip types, not just those a European fab might produce. Achieving this requires
three reinforcing capabilities: comprehensive dependency mapping, targeted investment
in high-leverage technologies, and stronger coordination for a credible European response
when chip access is threatened. These efforts will be more likely to succeed if embedded
within the broader competitiveness reforms recommended in the Draghi and Letta reports,
from capital-market integration to regulatory reform.


**I. Better Situational Awareness.** The Commission should map bidirectional dependencies,
identifying not only where Europe is vulnerable, but also where the global supply chain
depends on European technology. This requires mandatory data provision from key market
actors and greatly increased technical capacity at the Commission.


**II. Clearer Strategy.** Replace the 20% volume target with a strategic portfolio approach:
protect existing strengths in lithography equipment (ASML), precision optics (Zeiss), and
research infrastructure (imec); back emerging technologies where Europe can establish
future leverage; and reduce critical dependencies selectively, focusing on automotive and
edge inference chips rather than comprehensive manufacturing autonomy. The revised Act
should establish a Strategic Semiconductor Asset designation for entities at critical
chokepoints, triggering tailored support including extended state-aid flexibility, STEP
integration, fast-track permitting, and streamlined communication with the Commission.


**III. Stronger Coordination.** Europe's fragmented export control governance leaves
individual Member States vulnerable to external pressure. The revised Act should coordinate
export control decisions at EU level and develop a calibrated response framework; a menu
of retaliatory measures that Europe could deploy if third countries restrict Europe’s access
to chips. This provides credible deterrence without immediate escalation. The revised Act
should also establish a streamlined response mechanism with pre-approved triggers,
accelerated timelines, and a solidarity fund for companies affected by export controls.

## **I. Introduction**

As Europe prepares the next iteration of its semiconductor strategy, it faces a fundamental
choice between two paradigms for ensuring economic security. The
first— **Self-Sufficiency** —seeks security through domestic manufacturing autonomy. The
second— **Strategic Indispensability** —seeks security by being an irreplaceable partner in the
global semiconductor value chain.


[The 2023 Chips Act was drafted against the backdrop of the EU’s Digital Decade policy](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1781/oj/eng)
[programme, which includes an objective to double Europe’s share of global semiconductor](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/europes-digital-decade)
production from about 10% to 20% by 2030. The reality of the post-2022 AI boom and
shifting geopolitics suggests this goal is not only unattainable but arguably strategically
misguided. To secure access to the chips that will define the next decade, Europe should
shift focus from primarily chasing manufacturing autonomy to strengthening its critical
position in the global semiconductor ecosystem.


**The threat has changed.** When the Chips Act was drafted, the primary concern was
accidental supply chain disruption: pandemics paralysing logistics, droughts affecting
Taiwanese water supplies, fires at critical facilities. Today, threats to European chip access
are increasingly deliberate and strategic. China has demonstrated willingness to restrict
[exports for geopolitical purposes, and the possibility of a Chinese blockade or invasion of](https://www.csis.org/analysis/beyond-rare-earths-chinas-growing-threat-gallium-supply-chains)
[Taiwan remains all too real. Meanwhile, US policy increasingly prioritises American access:](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12309/china-engages-in-a-blockade-against-taiwan/)
[the Biden administration's AI Difusion Framework (now rescinded) created a tiered system](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA3776-1.html)
[restricting exports of AI chips even to many allied nations, while the proposed GAIN Act](https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/gain-ai-act-will-undermine-global-competitiveness-us-ai-chipmakers)
would require US companies to receive priority access to domestically produced chips
before others can purchase them. In short, semiconductors have increasingly become a
central theatre of geoeconomic competition. Policy designed for accidental supply chain
disruptions cannot adequately address this new reality.


**Self-Sufficiency remains out of reach.** Semiconductor manufacturing is one of the most
capital-intensive and technically complex undertakings in human history, with economics
that fundamentally favour geographic specialisation. Despite committing enormous
resources to domestic manufacturing, even the United States remains critically dependent
on other nations for its chip supply. According to the Commission's own research, Europe
[will reach only 11.7% market share in chip production by 2030, far short of the 20% target.](https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/publications?ref=sr-2025-12)
[Based on estimates by ASML, reaching the 20% target would require investment exceeding](https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/asml-position-paper-on-eu-chips-act)
€250 billion, and even then Europe would remain dependent on other countries for other
segments of the value chain. Building a leading-edge fabrication facility addresses one link
in the chain while leaving others exposed. At best, partial self-sufficiency provides partial
security at high cost.


**Europe has existing strengths to build upon.** While we strongly agree with the goal of
reducing vulnerability, we argue that "increasing manufacturing capacity" is the wrong
mechanism to achieve it for leading-edge nodes. Europe will always have critical
dependencies, if not for wafer fabrication, then for packaging, design IP, or raw materials.


3


Instead of striving for autarky in one segment, Europe should leverage its control over
irreplaceable inputs to create mutual dependency. By ensuring the global supply chain
remains dependent on Europe, the EU ensures that our partners (and rivals) have a strategic
interest in maintaining our access to their chips. This helps secure access to all advanced
chip types, not just the specific nodes a European fab might produce.


**As a think tank focused on emerging technologies and Europe's long-term trajectory, the**
**Centre for Future Generations views semiconductors as foundational to European**
**competitiveness.** Autonomy in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and digital services
ultimately depends on secure chip access. Europe is widely recognised for its strengths at
the upper end of the semiconductor supply chain, but these capabilities have not been
matched by strategic thinking about how to leverage and build on them. The revised Chips
Act is a critical opportunity to fill this gap and translate these capabilities into lasting
economic security.


**Translating European strengths into economic security requires better situational**
**awareness, clearer strategy, and stronger coordination.** First, Europe needs a clearer
picture of its own position; a systematic mapping of where the global semiconductor
supply chain depends on European technology, not just where Europe is vulnerable.
Second, investment strategy should shift from pursuing volume-based manufacturing
targets toward selectively strengthening areas of genuine competitive advantage. Third,
Member States must coordinate export control decisions and develop collective response
mechanisms, rather than responding individually to external pressure.

## **II. Better Situational Awareness: Global Dependency Mapping**


[The Commission's Call for Evidence acknowledges that the EU has insufficient “insight into](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14842-Chips-Act-2_en)
the resilience of key market actors, supply chains and the overall EU semiconductor
ecosystem”. This diagnosis is correct, but the ambition should go further. To operationalise
Strategic Indispensability, the Commission’s mandate must be expanded to map
bidirectional dependencies, identifying not only where Europe relies on the rest of the
world, but also where the global semiconductor ecosystem relies on Europe.


Better insight into the global semiconductor supply chain lays the foundation for effective
strategy; without it, Europe cannot prioritise investments, calibrate responses to external
pressure, or negotiate partnerships from a position of informed strength. We propose three
specific actions to achieve this:


**1. Conduct a comprehensive supply chain audit**


The Commission should broaden its activities under Pillar III of the Chips Act to
systematically map Europe's position in the global semiconductor value chain across four
dimensions:


4


_European vulnerabilities._ Where does Europe depend on concentrated external supply?
Which dependencies pose the greatest risk if access were restricted? This analysis already
[exists in partial form but should be deepened and continuously updated.](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/factpages/european-chips-act-monitoring-and-crisis-response)


_Global dependencies on Europe._ Where do other regions, including the United States and
China, depend on European technology? This assessment must extend beyond finished
equipment like EUV lithography machines to deeper tiers of the supply chain, identifying
positions in subcomponents such as high-end vacuum valves, specialised optics, lasers,
etching gases and advanced packaging equipment that are essential to global chip
manufacturing.


_Foresight_ : The analysis should not only map current dependencies but also anticipate where
dependencies are likely to grow or diminish, and where emerging technologies may create
new opportunities for European leverage.


_Opportunities for cooperation._ Where might collaboration with like-minded partners
strengthen collective resilience or create beneficial interdependencies? The EU has already
[launched derisking initiatives through semiconductor cooperation agreements with Japan,](https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2023/0704_004.html)
[South Korea, Taiwan,](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/eu-republic-korea-digital-partnership-joint-eurepublic-korea-chips-projects-announced) [India,](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_4380) [Malaysia, and the UK, among others. These partnerships should](https://ceias.eu/from-oil-to-chips-how-the-eu-malaysia-fta-became-a-semiconductor-power-play/#:~:text=With%20a%20second%20round%20of,and%20forge%20lucrative%20semiconductor%20partnerships.)
be deepened and systematically assessed for new opportunities to diversify supply chains
and cultivate complementary strengths. Increased manufacturing capacity in allied
countries could reduce shared dependencies on concentrated supply from China. For
[instance, supporting automotive chip production in India could diversify supply for a sector](https://business.cornell.edu/article/2025/04/the-future-is-now/#:~:text=Given%20the%20government%20initiatives%2C%20infrastructure,1%20million%20jobs%20by%202026.)
where Europe remains heavily exposed.


**2. Move from voluntary to mandatory data provision**


The current voluntary information-gathering regime leaves the Commission with significant
blind spots. Key market actors should be required to provide data on critical dependencies,
including geographic revenue exposure, customer concentration, and substitutability
assessments.


Member States should play a central role in this effort, since they maintain closer ties with
domestic industries. Industry associations can play a supporting role in developing
reporting standards that ensure data quality while protecting commercially sensitive
information.


**3. Align administrative capacity with strategic ambition**


Comprehensive supply chain mapping requires deep technical expertise and continuous
monitoring, yet the EU currently lacks the human resources to execute this mandate. The US
CHIPS and Science Act allocated roughly $1 billion to administrative capacity, enabling the
[Department of Commerce to hire over 140 dedicated staff. DG CNECT operates with a](https://www.interface-eu.org/publications/europe-semiconductor-strategy)
[small fraction of these resources.](https://www.interface-eu.org/publications/europe-semiconductor-strategy)


5


Europe cannot execute a complex industrial strategy without adequate capacity. The
revised Chips Act should earmark specific funding to build a dedicated technical unit
capable of conducting and maintaining supply chain analysis, including procurement of
proprietary market intelligence from specialised data providers.

## **III. Clearer Strategy: From Self-Sufficiency to Indispensability**


**Europe cannot buy its way to complete self-sufficiency in semiconductors.** The revised
Chips Act should prioritise strategic indispensability rather than domestic manufacturing
autonomy. The Semicon Coalition's declaration argues that the current 20% market share
[target is "too broad, lacking clear strategic direction on where and why Europe should lead](https://www.bundeswirtschaftsministerium.de/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/D/declaration-of-the-semicon-coalition-calling-for-a-revised-eu-chips-act.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5)
[in the semiconductor value chain." The revised Chips Act should replace a volume-based](https://www.bundeswirtschaftsministerium.de/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/D/declaration-of-the-semicon-coalition-calling-for-a-revised-eu-chips-act.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5)
target with a strategic framework that directs investment toward areas where Europe can
realistically achieve and sustain global indispensability.


**The concept of strategic indispensability provides the organising principle for this shift.**
[In essence, it means securing Europe’s position as a non-substitutable actor in the global](https://ecfr.eu/article/chips-on-the-menu-how-the-eu-can-get-its-act-together-on-semiconductors/)
[semiconductor ecosystem, ensuring that other powers cannot aford to cut Europe out.](https://ecfr.eu/article/chips-on-the-menu-how-the-eu-can-get-its-act-together-on-semiconductors/)
[Japan’s recent semiconductor strategy is an example the EU should follow, it aims for](https://www.jiia.or.jp/en/ajiss_commentary/japans-economic-security-and-semiconductor-industry.html)
“maintaining, boosting and obtaining strategic indispensability” across the sector to resist
the loss of economic power. For the EU, holding these global bottlenecks on European soil
turns existing strengths into durable geopolitical leverage in an increasingly transactional
semiconductor landscape.


**This shift matters because Europe cannot win a subsidy race it cannot afford to enter.** It
seems unlikely that the EU would be willing and able to outspend or match the US and China
when it comes to the hundreds of billions required to develop a full-stack domestic
semiconductor industry. Moreover, such an approach would misallocate Europe’s limited
financial firepower. Instead, Pillar II of the Chips Act should adopt a strategic portfolio
approach, directing resources toward sectors where Europe can establish or maintain
irreplaceable positions in the global semiconductor supply chain, while cost-effectively
reducing our most critical vulnerabilities.


This portfolio approach requires investments in three distinct but complementary
categories:


**1. Protect existing European strengths**


**Europe already possesses several essential nodes in the global semiconductor supply**
**chain, and safeguarding them is the most immediate route to strategic indispensability.**
[ASML maintains a unique monopoly in EUV lithography, Zeiss provides the precision optics](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4354007-asml-not-just-a-monopoly-in-euv-lithography)
[that make these systems viable, and TRUMPF supplies the high-power lasers that are](https://www.trumpf.com/en_US/solutions/applications/euv-lithography/)
required for advanced chip manufacturing. Beyond equipment, Europe’s research
[infrastructure (most notably imec) functions as a global coordination point for](https://www.imec-int.com/en/press/crucial-role-imec-eu-chips-act)


6


pre-competitive R&D and next-generation process development. These are strategic
advantages that Europe already possesses, and that others cannot easily replicate. The
priority in this category is preserving and deepening Europe’s technological lead, ensuring
these firms remain globally leading, and preventing any erosion or foreign capture of the
capabilities that form Europe’s most valuable leverage in the semiconductor system.


**2. Back the next wave of high-value chip technologies**


**Europe must establish control over tomorrow's bottlenecks before others do.** The
semiconductor landscape evolves rapidly, and critical technologies shift as physical limits
are reached and architectures change. Europe therefore needs to identify emerging choke
points early, investing where well-timed support can translate existing R&D leadership into
leading market positions before these sectors consolidate.


**Advanced Packaging and Photonics represent two of the most promising bets for**
**strategic indispensability.** Advanced Packaging refers to techniques that stack and
connect multiple chips into a single module, boosting performance without requiring
ever-smaller transistors. Europe's strong position in hybrid bonding, a precision method for
connecting chip layers, through firms such as Besi and research platforms like imec, could
offer a cost-effective route to influence advanced AI hardware without attempting to build
a leading-edge logic fab. Photonics, the use of light rather than electrical signals to transmit
data, is the second promising area. Its most significant near-term application is
Co-Packaged Optics, which integrates optical components directly into chip packages to
enable faster and more energy-efficient data transfer. This is an emerging architectural shift
that could define next-generation data-centre efficiency, and where Europe has a real
opportunity to establish a control point. Dependency mapping should guide these bets,
ensuring public support targets future bottlenecks rather than legacy ambitions.


**Europe should also place a major bet on translating research excellence into long-term**
**leverage.** Europe's strongest comparative advantage lies in foundational semiconductor
[research, and institutions such as imec already demonstrate how public R&D can shape](https://www.imec-int.com/en/press/imec-ranked-number-one-start-accelerator-ubi-global)
[global technology trajectories through IP, standards influence and early-stage venture](https://www.imec-int.com/en/press/imec-ranked-number-one-start-accelerator-ubi-global)
creation. Doubling down on this strength would allow Europe to shape emerging design
spaces while they are still fluid. This could be done by expanding support for
pre-competitive research platforms, licensing models and early exploration of novel chip
architectures. As we propose below, the revised Chips Act should hardwire this link by
integrating leading research institutions into the STEP framework and launching
Coordinated Research Programs aimed at translating R&D strengths into future Strategic
Semiconductor Assets.


**3. Targeted resilience through reducing critical dependencies**


**Europe needs selective resilience, not blanket capacity expansion.** Strategic investment
in this category aims not at comprehensive manufacturing autarky, but at _selective_ capacity
building in segments where (1) European demand is substantial and persistent, (2) external


7


supply concentration creates genuine vulnerability, and (3) investment costs are
proportionate to the economic risks mitigated. Targeted support for European IDMs such as
Infineon, STMicroelectronics and NXP, firms that became central to Europe’s automotive
[supply chain during the 2021 automotive chip shortages, when supply disruptions idled](https://www.acea.auto/fact/facts-about-the-automobile-industry/)
factories across the continent, can sustain domestic capacity in power electronics,
microcontrollers and MEMS sensors essential to Europe’s automotive and industrial base.
Strategic co-investment with trusted partners, particularly Japan, South Korea and Taiwan,
can likewise diversify supply for specific chip categories while avoiding the inefficiency of
duplicative build-outs.


**Reducing Europe’s exposure to NVIDIA’s dominance in AI accelerators requires focusing**
**on the part of the stack where Europe has a more realistic chance to compete, and**
**actively empowering European design of inference chips.** AI deployment is shifting rapidly
[beyond datacentres, and inference compute is expected to account for up to 70% of total](https://www.ft.com/content/bdfd7fc6-d0df-4070-96e5-7900b0cc1204)
[AI compute demand by 2026. Unlike training, where NVIDIA’s integrated hardware–software](https://www.ft.com/content/bdfd7fc6-d0df-4070-96e5-7900b0cc1204)
ecosystem remains highly dominant, edge inference prioritises energy efficiency, latency
and reliability, areas where European industry already has comparative strengths. The
revised Chips Act should therefore prioritise support for European inference chip design
[and prototyping, for example by expanding access to platforms such as imec’s IC-Link,](https://www.imeciclink.com/en/asics-ai)
which lower barriers for European firms to design and fabricate application-specific
[accelerators. Firms such as Axelera have demonstrated commercial momentum, while the](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/dutch-chipmaker-axeleraai-gets-66-million-eu-grant-2025-03-06/)
[broader ARM ecosystem provides mature foundations for low-power architectures.](https://www.arm.com/markets/artificial-intelligence/cpu-inference)


**Empowering strategic assets: A flexible and fast support framework**


Europe’s most valuable semiconductor leverage comes from a small number of firms and
research organisations that sit at hard-to-replace points in the global value chain. To
safeguard these positions, the revised Chips Act should introduce a formal designation for
Strategic Semiconductor Assets. These are entities whose technologies, IP or research
capabilities are essential to global semiconductor production and therefore to Europe’s
economic security.


The Commission should work with Member States and industry to define criteria and
procedures for this designation. The mechanism should respect three principles:


●​ **Aligned with dependency mapping**   - eligibility should be grounded in the

bidirectional dependency analysis proposed under Pillar III of the Chips Act, so that
only assets that clearly sit on critical choke points qualify.
●​ **Objective and measurable**   - it should be possible to verify, using transparent

indicators, whether an asset meets the agreed criteria, for example contribution to
globally non-substitutable equipment, materials or research platforms.
●​ **Fast and predictable**   - semiconductor technology and market structure move

quickly, so assessment cannot be allowed to go on for months. Decisions on
Strategic Asset status should normally be taken within weeks, on the basis of
standardised information requirements.


8


This designation should trigger a tailored support framework that strengthens
competitiveness, accelerates scaling, and protects these entities from strategic capture.
Member States and the Commission should jointly assess what each asset actually needs.
There is no single template; the support required by a mature equipment monopoly differs
fundamentally from the capital-intensive scaling needs of an emerging start-up, which in
turn differs from the requirements of a legacy chip manufacturer. Strategic judgement,
informed by the dependency mapping described earlier, is needed to choose the right
combination of measures. The following tools should be considered for this purpose.


●​ **Extend Chips Act State-Aid flexibility to all Strategic Assets:** The Chips Act already

offers special state-aid flexibility for first-of-a-kind fabs. Chips Act 2.0 should
broaden this treatment to all designated Strategic Semiconductor Assets, giving
them priority approval, higher permissible aid intensities and simplified compatibility
criteria, without requiring a first-of-a-kind manufacturing project. This ensures
Europe’s critical choke-points receive the same level of strategic support as its
manufacturing ambitions.
●​ **Integrate with STEP:** Strategic Semiconductor Assets should automatically qualify

for the STEP “Sovereignty Seal” and be treated as priority projects across EU
programmes such as InvestEU, Horizon Europe, the European Defence Fund and any
future European Competitiveness Fund. Chips Act 2.0 should hard-wire this linkage,
so that once an entity is designated as a Strategic Semiconductor Asset, it is visible
and prioritised across the full economic security toolbox rather than relying on ad
hoc programme-by-programme decisions.
●​ **Strategic Permitting and One-Stop Shops:** [In line with the Semicon Coalition's](https://cdn.table.media/assets/europe/embargo-250924-final-version-semicon-declaration_250929_101528.pdf)

[declaration, these entities should benefit from "emergency permitting legislation" to](https://cdn.table.media/assets/europe/embargo-250924-final-version-semicon-declaration_250929_101528.pdf)
fast-track facility expansions, environmental review, energy grid connections, and
construction approval. The Commission and Member States should also establish
dedicated, rapid communication channels with Strategic Semiconductor Assets,
treating them as critical partners in economic security rather than generic industry
lobbies.
●​ **Use investment incentives to build the ecosystem:** To turn Europe’s incumbent

champions into engines for ecosystem growth, the Commission should encourage
Member States to introduce generous, time-limited tax incentives for capital
expenditure and equity investment by Strategic Semiconductor Assets into other
semiconductor firms.
●​ **Simplify and broaden participation in IPCEIs** : Simplify governance and procedures

[so SMEs, mid-caps and frms from smaller, less-wealthy Member States can more](https://www.epc.eu/publication/Making-IPCEIs-a-new-vanguard-for-EU-industrial-policy-650b30/)
[easily join. In line with Draghi’s competitiveness proposals, introduce a dedicated](https://www.epc.eu/publication/Making-IPCEIs-a-new-vanguard-for-EU-industrial-policy-650b30/)
“fast-track” IPCEI window for semiconductor projects with shorter approval times
and partial co-financing from the EU budget.
●​ **Launch Coordinated Research Programs (CRPs):** Europe lacks a mechanism to fund

"super-additive" research that is too complex for single labs but too risky for private
investors and start-ups. The revised Chips Act should allow for the creation of CRPs,
[modelled on Focused Research Organisations, led by empowered programme](https://www.renaissancephilanthropy.org/playbooks/coordinated-research-programs)

managers and financed through the existing Chips Joint Undertaking and Horizon
Europe. These programmes would be time-bound, engineering-focused missions
that tackle clearly identified market failures, for example pre-competitive platforms
or high-risk capability demonstrators, and explicitly aim to translate Europe’s
research strengths into future Strategic Semiconductor Assets.


The objective is establishing a flexible strategic toolkit, that can be used effectively to
support both large incumbents that need to remain strong and new market entrants that are
attempting to take on (potentially) strategically important technologies. Europe should
protect its strategic assets from capture, while ensuring they possess every advantage
necessary to thrive in their segments of the global supply chain.


**Beyond immediate sectoral support, Europe’s semiconductor strategy will have a better**
**chance of succeeding if it is grounded in the broader competitiveness reforms**
**recommended in the Draghi and Letta reports.** These reports call for a more strategic
industrial policy in key sectors, combined with large-scale and better coordinated
investment, particularly through a strengthened Capital Markets Union. They also advocate
for a leaner and more predictable regulatory framework, deeper capital-market integration
to mobilise private savings, stronger venture-capital and risk-finance ecosystems, and
policies to build and deploy a highly skilled workforce across the single market.

## **IV. Stronger Coordination: Building a Credible European** **Response**


As argued in the introduction, over the past years the primary threat to European chip
access has shifted from accidental supply chain disruptions to deliberate export
restrictions imposed by third countries. Yet today, despite controlling important leverage
points in the global semiconductor supply chain, Europe remains poorly positioned to
respond to such geoeconomic threats. Three factors explain this vulnerability:


_Fragmented European export control governance._ European decision-making regarding
export controls and technology transfer remains scattered across 27 Member States.
Consequently, decisions with European-wide consequences are taken at the national level,
often under pressure from major powers. Individual Member States can be isolated and
pressured in ways that a unified Europe could not, weakening Europe's bargaining position
in negotiations with partners and competitors alike.


_A lack of calibrated response options._ Europe's most obvious retaliatory leverage, such as
restricting exports of ASML's DUV or EUV tools, is a measure of last resort that can’t be
credibly used in most trade disputes without triggering severe retaliation. The EU lacks the
intermediate, proportional instruments needed to respond to coercion or signal resolve
without precipitating a serious escalation.


10


_An ill-suited collective response framework._ The Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) provides a
template for an EU-wide response to economic coercion, but its multi-stage process can
delay action by nearly a year, far too slow for semiconductor supply chain disruptions.
Moreover, it requires demonstrating that coercion is specifically intended to influence EU
policy, a threshold not always met in chip export restrictions. For instance, should the US
restrict exports of AI chips “on national security grounds”, it is unclear whether the ACI could
be used.


The EU’s vulnerable negotiating position contrasts sharply with that of the United States and
China, both of which possess centralised mechanisms for rapid, coordinated action on
semiconductors. Europe's fragmentation is a strategic liability, undermining both its ability
to defend against coercion and to negotiate partnerships from a position of strength. We
propose three actions to address these vulnerabilities.


**1. Coordinate export control decisions at the EU level**


The current fragmented approach to export controls has already proved damaging to
European competitiveness. For example, under the current system, the Netherlands has
effectively been forced to shoulder a large part of the economic burden of complying with
[US export controls on China: ASML’s sales to China (representing around 30% of its total](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/16/asml-2025-outlook-shows-us-chip-export-curbs-impacting-china-sales.html)

[found loopholes, and may soon receive ofcial approval, to continue selling](https://www.csis.org/analysis/insight-us-semiconductor-export-controls-update)
high-performance chips to China. While restricting China's access to advanced lithography
equipment serves legitimate Western security interests, the current asymmetry is
economically and politically unsustainable. EU-level coordination would enable Europe to
uphold security commitments while negotiating fair terms with allies and ensuring economic
costs are distributed equitably across the Union, rather than borne by individual Member
States.


[A recent study by the Chips Diplomacy Support Initiative (CHIPSDIPLO) reveals strong](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/publications/semiconductors-european-views-four-2029-tech-transfer-regime-scenarios)
industry support for a unified EU approach. In a scenario workshop involving legal counsels,
directors and compliance officers from 10 leading European semiconductor companies
and RTOs, industry experts rated the desirability of the current fragmented status quo at a
dismal 2.78/10, compared to 6.44/10 for a unified EU regime. Furthermore, respondents
predicted that centralising export decisions would more than double Europe's negotiating
leverage vis-à-vis the United States, and significantly reduce threats to European
competitiveness.


Decisions to restrict access to Europe's strategic semiconductor assets should be elevated
to the EU level. When a European company is compelled to restrict exports to serve Western
security interests, this should be a collective decision, enabling the EU to negotiate
reciprocal commitments such as security of supply guarantees.


**2. Develop a calibrated response framework**


11


Europe currently lacks intermediate options between passively accepting restrictions on its
chip access and deploying its most extreme leverage. What is needed is a range of
measures that could signal resolve and impose costs in response to coercion, but which fall
short of actions that would trigger immediate diplomatic crises.


Such options might span a spectrum of intensity: from limiting access to pre-competitive
research programmes, to restricting IP licensing, to export controls on consumables (e.g.
photoresists, etching gases) and subcomponents (e.g. vacuum valves, speciality optics), to
suspending maintenance contracts for installed ASML equipment. The appropriate
measures in any scenario would depend on where the country imposing restrictions is most
dependent on European technology, exactly the kind of insight that comprehensive supply
chain mapping would provide.


Identifying which intermediate options would be most effective, and anticipating the range
of possible counter-responses from third countries, requires dedicated expert analysis. The
Commission should conduct a systematic study to map Europe's available retaliatory
options across different chip access restriction scenarios, model likely responses, and
develop a framework that gives policymakers a genuine menu of choices. Given the pace of
technological and geopolitical developments, this analysis must be an ongoing effort rather
than a one-off exercise.


**3. Establish a streamlined response mechanism**


To overcome the limitations of the ACI, the revised Chips Act should establish a
sector-specific coordination mechanism that enables rapid collective action when
European semiconductor access is threatened. While the detailed design of such a
mechanism will require further consultation with Member States, we would encourage the
Commission to consider the following elements:


●​ **Collective Decision-Making** : To ensure Europe presents a united front, the

Commission should be empowered to develop response measures in consultation
with the European Semiconductor Board, and propose this collective position for
Council adoption. To prevent third countries from exploiting divisions within the EU,
the governance framework must insulate collective decisions from external pressure
applied to individual Member States.
●​ **Crisis-Appropriate Timelines** : The mechanism should allow for decision-making

timelines appropriate to the pace of semiconductor crises, which can unfold in days
rather than months.
●​ **Pre-Approved Triggers** : For specific, high-stakes scenarios, such as a Chinese

blockade or invasion of Taiwan, the Council should consider pre-approving triggers
that would result in an automatic response, with additional measures available as
circumstances require. This establishes clear red lines and ensures immediate
coordinated action in times of crisis.


12


●​ **Proportionality Requirements** : Governance rules must ensure responses are

carefully calibrated to the severity of the threat, maximising leverage while
minimising collateral damage to European industry.
●​ **Solidarity Mechanism** : The Commission and Member States should consider setting

up a pre-capitalised Compensation Fund to indemnify European companies for
losses incurred when response measures are deployed. This ensures that individual
companies or Member States do not bear the cost of collective European defence.


The goal is not to encourage confrontation, but to ensure Europe has credible deterrence
options. A coordination mechanism that demonstrates Europe’s ability to act swiftly and
collectively significantly strengthens Europe's negotiating position, and reduces the
likelihood that such measures will ever need to be actively deployed.

## **V. Conclusion**


**The revised Chips Act arrives at a pivotal moment for European semiconductor strategy.**
The 2023 Act's ambition to reach 20% of global chip production was a reasonable response
to the supply chain disruptions of 2020-2022, but the threat landscape has fundamentally
changed. Today, the primary risk to European chip access is not accidental disruption, but
deliberate restriction by major powers pursuing their own strategic interests. A strategy built
around manufacturing capacity cannot address a world where semiconductors have
become instruments of economic leverage. Europe must adapt accordingly.


**Strategic indispensability offers a more realistic and effective path to securing chip**
**access.** Rather than pursuing partial self-sufficiency at enormous cost, Europe should
leverage its existing strengths in lithography, precision optics, research infrastructure, and
emerging technologies like advanced packaging. This requires three reinforcing
capabilities: comprehensive dependency mapping to understand where Europe's leverage
lies, targeted investment to protect existing strengths and secure future bottlenecks, and
credible coordination mechanisms to translate that leverage into durable chip access. The
goal is not confrontation, but deterrence: ensuring that partners and competitors alike
recognise that maintaining European access to semiconductors is in their strategic interest.
By adopting this approach, the revised Chips Act can position Europe not as a laggard in a
subsidy race it cannot win, but as an indispensable actor in the global semiconductor
ecosystem.
