# Abstract

On 5 [th] September 2025, the European Commission published a _Call for Evidence for an Evaluation_
_and Impact Assessment_ concerning the review of the EU Chips Act (Chips Act 2). The initiative is
aimed at strengthening the EU’s resilience and technological sovereignty in semiconductor
technologies and applications, in particular by:




- Reducing the EU’s dependency on other parts of the world for leading-edge chips, notably

by increasing the EU’s manufacturing capacity in advanced semiconductors for critical
sectors, and

- Increasing systemic insight into the resilience of key market actors, supply chains, and the

overall EU semiconductor ecosystem to enable more effective monitoring and crisis
preparedness.



The Centre for a Digital Society (CDS) at the European University Institute (EUI) welcomes the
opportunity to contribute to this consultation. The submission addresses the three issues
highlighted in the Call for Evidence:


  - The EU’s persistent dependence on non-EU suppliers for sub-10 nm chips;

  - The erosion of Europe’s competitive edge in essential and mainstream semiconductors;

  - The limited visibility over the resilience and vulnerabilities of the semiconductor

ecosystem.


Our analysis aims to support a forward-looking policy debate by identifying institutional,
economic, and governance gaps that hinder the effective implementation of the Chips Act and by
outlining evidence-based options to strengthen the framework. In evaluating the Commission’s
policy options, the CDS identifies targeted amendments to the Chips Act (Option 2) as the more
effective and strategically coherent avenue for addressing Europe’s structural vulnerabilities.


In its conclusions, the CDS recommends:




- Designing targeted instruments to secure EU’s access to leading edge chips for strategic

sectors and participation in their manufacturing while safeguarding competition and
innovation;

- Reinforcing long-term support for Europe’s competitive strengths in essential and

mainstream semiconductors;

- Establishing a structured, proportionate, and enforceable EU-level data gathering

framework, integrated with Member State and selected firm-level reporting to improve
ecosystem mapping and risk assessment.

Florence, 28 [th] November 2025

On 5 [th] September 2025, the European Commission launched a Call for Evidence for an Evalua`on
[and Impact Assessment concerning the review of the Chips act (Chips Act 2). The Centre for a](https://www.digitalsociety.eui.eu/)
[Digital Society](https://www.digitalsociety.eui.eu/) (CDS) at the [European University Ins`tute (EUI) welcomes the opportunity to](https://www.eui.eu/en/home)
contribute to this important consulta`on and to share its academic insights in the field.

This contribu`on builds upon the CDS’ engagement with regula`on, innova`on compe``on, and
industrial policies, and digital markets. These lines of research, together with the Centre’s
interdisciplinary exper`se in law, economics, and poli`cal science, underpins the CDS interest to
contribute to policymaking discussions concerning Europe’s evolving technological landscape.

The Centre for a Digital Society is funded by the European Commission (via structural funding,
service contracts and grants, awarded via compe``ve tender procedures), other public
ins`tu`ons, and market donors. In accep`ng private funding, in the form of unrestricted
contribu`ons to the CDS budget, the Centre observes the highest academic standards, in terms of
intellectual rigor and independence.

Through this Posi`on Statement, the CDS seeks to contribute to the policy debate on the future
of Europe’s semiconductor strategy, suppor`ng a debate that is analy`cally grounded, forwardlooking, and reflec`ve of the diverse industrial and ins`tu`onal reali`es across Member States.
The CDS remains at the European Commission’s disposal for any further ques`ons, and is ready to
jointly organize workshops, engage in research collabora`on or other ac`vi`es that may assist in
designing a more robust semiconductor framework for the European Union.

# 1. Introduction and Rationale


Semiconductors have become a central concern of European economic, technological, and
security policy. As the EU prepares its mandatory 2026 review of the Chips Act, the Commission’s
Call for Evidence comes at a moment when the global industry undergoes profound geopoli`cal
realignment, especially in view of the rapid deployment of AI, the accelera`on of highperformance compu`ng, the growing semiconductor intensity of sectors such as defence, space,
and automo`ve, and the impact of trade restric`ons. More than EUR 80 billion in announced


4


semiconductor investments and recent State aid approvals for first-of-a-kind facili`es underscore
the strategic weight aeached to this policy domain. The Chips Act itself acknowledges that “no
single geography dominates all steps of the value chain”, poin`ng to the structural
interdependence that characterises the semiconductor value chain.

The Commission’s Call for Evidence highlights three persistent challenges:

a) Europe’s dependence on external suppliers for advanced-node chips (<10 nm);
b) Pressures on its leadership in essen`al semiconductors; and
c) The absence of a sufficiently granular insight into supply-chain vulnerabili`es and

technology-leakage risks.

This Posi`on Statement examines the challenges iden`fied in the Call for Evidence against the
evidence emerging from recent policy and academic analysis, available mapping exercises, and
market analyses.

The analysis moves from a diagnosis of the most apparent vulnerabili`es of the Chips Act,
informed by an overview of recent policy and academic contribu`ons. As is well known, the Chips
Act was adopted in response to several crises: Europe reacted to the COVID-19 supply shocks, to
simultaneous U.S. industrial policy ini`a`ves, and to what the CDS believes to be an inaccurate
poli`cal narra`ve emphasizing that Europe share of global chip manufacturing declined
significantly. The CDS therefore considers this review as an important opportunity to improve a
trajectory shaped by emergency responses and poten`ally misinterpreted benchmarks, and to reanchor policy in a more realis`c assessments of Europe’s structural posi`on in the global value
chain.

Europe retains globally indispensable strengths in semiconductor equipment and specialised
industrial inputs, where it is a net exporter with low exposure to foreign supply. By contrast, the
EU has limited domes`c capacity in logic and memory chips, with extra-EU imports accoun`ng for
nearly 60% of supply and severe concentra`on in certain World Semiconductors Trade Sta`s`cs
categories (JRC, 2025). Moreover, Europe’s semiconductor demand is structurally dis`nct:
automo`ve and industrial users absorb the majority of shipments to Europe, with the automo`ve
sector alone accoun`ng for 37%, thereby shaping the con`nent’s vulnerability profile and its
opportuni`es for strategic specialisa`on.

A credible strategy requires, first, a granular understanding of Europe’s domes`c
semiconductor ecosystems . As Kleinhans (2024) notes, while the United States has on several


5


occasions requested informa`on and conducted surveys to map its semiconductor capabili`es,
most EU Member States have not carried out comparable exercises. The Commission’s own
mapping remains insufficiently detailed to inform strategic decision-making, in part because
na`onal ecosystems differ significantly: some Member States have substan`al manufacturing
capacity, while others host important research and technology organisa`ons and equipment
suppliers. Without Member-State-level ecosystem data intelligence, it is impossible to formulate
meaningful long-term objec`ves or to design interven`ons that could lead to genuine compara`ve
advantage.

Second, Member States and the EU must have a clear understanding of why they support this
sector and what long-term outcomes they pursue. Industrial, foreign policy and economicsecurity objec`ves presently differ across Member States; without explicit co-ordina`on of
na`onal aims, Europe risks policy fragmenta`on and inconsistency in the response to shiqs in the
U.S.-China rivalry.

Third, aeen`on should be paid to ensure adequate resources to the EU administra`ve
capacity . At present, apparently only a handful of officials at a single Directorate (DG CNECT) work
full-`me on semiconductors, while most Member States have minimal dedicated governmental
capacity, despite the complexity of the value chain and the scale of the policy challenges
(Kleinhans, 2024). A credible long-term strategy requires the development of a greater analy`cal,
technical, and geopoli`cal exper`se within both the Commission and Member States.

# 2. Problem-Structured Analysis


Semiconductor markets are characterized by steep but also highly differentiated barriers to entry:
the resource intensity, technological complexity, and economies of scale required vary
significantly across segments of the value chain. These structural differences mean that Europe’s
opportunities and vulnerabilities are not homogenous but segment specific. This section therefore
examines the problems identified in the Commission’s Call for Evidence through two distinct
lenses:


  - Europe’s dependence on non-EU countries for leading-edge chips, and

  - The preservation of Europe’s competitive edge in mainstream and essential

semiconductors.


6


Treating these problems separately reflects the markedly different industrial dynamics, policy
levers, and strategic risks associated with each segment of the semiconductor value chain.

### 2.1. Europe’s dependence on non-EU countries for the supply of leading-edge (<10 nm) chips


Europe’s continued dependence on non-EU suppliers for the most advanced <10nm chips reflects
a deep structural misalignment between the requirements of advanced-node manufacturing and
the EU’s economic, institutional, and industrial conditions. Activities across the semiconductor
value chain demand very different types of inputs: some segments, such as pre-competitive R&D,
chip design, and equipment production, are knowledge- and innovation-intensive, whereas
others, notably front-end wafer fabrication, are capital- and labour-intensive. As these stages draw
on distinct resource endowments, countries tend to specialize where their labour markets, capital
availability, and institutional settings allow them to compete more efficiently. Differences in
resource intensity therefore play a central role in shaping the global distribution of semiconductor
activities (An and Yin, 2025).


The location choices of semiconductor manufacturers are also strongly influenced by proximity to
major downstream end-user markets. The U.S. reins in logic chip design (especially those used in
ICT and large PCs), East Asian countries dominate memory chip design and assembly, test, and
packaging (ATP) operations (fundamental for smartphones and other consumer electronics), while
Europe specializes in chips used for automotive and industrial manufacturing, which mirrors its
own industrial strengths (An and Yin, 2025).


Finding effective solutions to Europe’s dependence on non-EU countries for the supply of leading
edge <10 nm chips thus requires understanding structural limits that this demand profile places
on Europe’s ability to sustain certain areas of production domestically.


First, Europe lacks a large consumer-electronics sector that could generate the scale of logic- and
memory-chip demand that anchors such facilities elsewhere. Second, advanced node fabs require
massive, continuous throughput to amortise high capital costs. This mismatch is compounded by
the extreme capital intensity of front-end fabrication: in 2020, 64% of global semiconductor capital
expenditure was concentrated in wafer-fabrication facilities, [1] while combined R&D and capex
oscillated around 35% of semiconductor sales between 2021-2023 (SIA, 2025). For more than
twenty years, U.S. semiconductor firms have sustained capital expenditures above 10% of sales in



1 Draghi Report (2024), ci4ng _Capital IQ, 2020. Gartner, 2020._



7


nearly every year (except for 2009-2010), and R&D expenditures above 15% of sales for twentyfour consecutive years (SIA, 2025).


The structural demand constraints imply that moving into advanced-node fabrication in Europe
would require high volumes of mid- to long-term, high-risk capital. However, Europe’s financial
system may be not yet be providing the amount of capital and risk-tolerance needed to support
such investment at scale, making adaptation necessary if Europe aims to compete in advancednode fabrication.


Survey data from the EIB (2023) show that access to finance remains a major constraint for EU
firms, particularly SMEs, and that European firms rely far more on bank lending than on equity or
bond markets. Also, Europeans have important savings, but 31% of EU-27 household assets remain
in currency and deposits, compared with 12% in the US, leaving only 35% of savings available for
risk-bearing investment, versus 54% in the U.S. (Marcus and Rossi, 2024). [2] This weakens Europe’s
capacity to mobilise long-term, high-risk capital.


Third, labour market conditions, which also play a relevant role in semiconductor firms’ investment
decisions, further constrain Europe’s competitiveness. Even with subsidies accounted for,
Europe’s operating cost for a standard mature logic fab are comparable to U.S. levels but
significantly higher than those in Taiwan or China, driven by labour costs that are 2-3x higher than
in Asia and utility prices that are 2x those in the U.S. Furthermore, European construction timelines
(40-50 months to reach volume production) are far slower than Taiwan’s 28-32 months, reflecting
qualified labour shortages, lower productivity, and protracted timelines for obtaining permits
(McKinsey, 2025).


Finally, semiconductor production is also cyclical, characterised by alternating periods of capacity
shortages and oversupply. It is thus important to understand the financial impact of cyclical
downturn on EU-based facilities. During downturns, when utilisation rates may fall sharply, fabs
must absorb substantial fixed costs. These cycles can create strong asymmetric pressures across
regions if capital, labour markets and regulatory environments differ significantly in the extent to
which they allow flexibility in adjusting capacity utilisation.


Geopolitical analysis reinforces these structural constraints. Wong et al. (2024) show that
advanced-node manufacturing operators under a highly cumulative technological regime in which
process knowledge, yield optimisation, and organisational learning compound over decades.
Leading-edge fabs integrate over 1,000 interdependent process steps and rely on a handful of
critical tools, most prominently Dutch ASML’s EU lithography machines, that operate as global
chokepoints. Latecomers face not only capital constraints but also restricted access to lithography,
deposition, inspection equipment and EDA tools due to U.S.-led export controls. Despite

markets, heterogenous na4onal regula4on, persistent Single Market fragmenta4on.

exceptional policy support, China – possessing the world’s largest domestic semiconductor market

- remains two to three generations behind the global frontier in advanced logic and memory
(Grimes, 2022). SMIC’s limited progress beyond 28nm and the continued dominance of Taiwan
and Korean at <10nm illustrate how first-mover advantages and cumulative tacit knowledge lock
in the technological leaders. Taiwanese and Korean firms increasingly pursue a ‘high-end at home,
lower-end abroad’ strategy, maintaining cutting-edge production domestically


All these structural realities underscore why Europe’s gap cannot be easily closed through
subsidies or isolated national investments. Europe’s dependence on non-EU suppliers for <10nm
chips is not merely a function of insufficient demand or short-term cost disadvantages; it reflects
systemic limitations. Limited domestic demand, insufficient capital-market depth, labour-market
rigidity, and the absence of cumulative learning process represent a series of decisive factors that
market forces alone cannot overcome.


The structural constraints identified above, however, could be affected and probably alleviated by
recent technological trends in advanced-node manufacturing. Even for frontier producers such as
TSMC and Samsung, continued ‘planar scaling’ has entered a phase of sharply diminishing returns.
Industry analyses show that node shrinkage in the 5nm, 3nm, and 2nm progression is
characterised by escalating current leakage, thermal-management difficulties, more challenging
yield control, and increasing per-transistors cost despite non-linear performance gains (Ma et al.,
forthcoming, 2026). These technological and economic dynamics indicate that the economics of
leading-edge logic have fundamentally shifted: the traditional assumption that smaller nodes
automatically improve cost-performance ratios no longer holds.


In this context, attempts by latecomers to replicate frontier logic production face not only
structural disadvantages but also enter a segment whose cost curve increasingly favours
incumbents with deep cumulative process knowledge. Particularly, considering that global
innovation trajectories are moving away from pure planar scaling toward ‘system-level
collaboration’: chiplet architecture, 3D stacking, and heterogenous integration capable of
delivering performance improvements without relying on ever finer lithography. These
developments could enhance Europe’s existing comparative advantages in upstream equipment,
advanced materials, power electronics, as well as its strong position in system-level integration for
automotive and industrial applications. The technological shift towards system coordination
seems to reinforce the argument that Europe’s strategy should focus on limited missioncritical access to leading-edge capacity while deepening the technology domains where it
already possesses global strengths.


These technological dynamics have a direct counterpart on the innovation side. Patent-related
evidence, explored by CDS research, indicates that semiconductor innovation exhibits the
characteristics of a mature and path-dependent technology, with only marginal growth in
technological-class diversity over the past decade and innovation activity remaining

9


predominantly nationally concentrated rather than including international collaborations
(Pisarkiewicz et al, 2024). Leadership in the most complex semiconductor classes is held by a small
group of long-established incumbents, reinforcing the cumulative capabilities and entrenched
advantages described above and further narrowing the scope for latecomers to gain a foothold at
the frontier.


Given both the structural constraints identified above and the global shift from planar scaling to
system-level integration, Europe should carefully assess its future strategy for developing
advanced-node ecosystem that seems to be increasingly uneconomic for latecomers and
dominated by incumbents with deep cumulative process knowledge. A realistic strategy
therefore requires coordinated public intervention, strategic financing instruments, close
alignment with trusted partners, and an economic-security-driven approach to negotiating
long-term guaranteed access to leading-edge capacity.

### 2.2. Preserving Europe’s competitive edge in mainstream/essential semiconductor industry


Europe retains globally significant strengths in several segments of the mainstream and essential
semiconductor value chain: power electronic, analog and mixed-signal devices, microcontrollers,
sensors, photonics, and specialized industrial chips. These activities draw on Europe’s comparative
advantages in R&D-intensive upstream technologies, diversified industrial demand (notably
automotive and industrial automation), and deep ecosystems in equipment, materials, and design.
The Joint Research Centre (2025) notes that Europe is a net exporter of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, with global leadership in microlithography and mask-making systems,
segments that accounted for 30% of worldwide wafer-fabrication equipment sales in 2023 (JRC,
2025). These upstream strengths also underpin the competitiveness of European producers in
DOSA (discrete, optoelectronic, sensors, actuators), analog, and microcontroller chips; core inputs
for Europe’s strategic manufacturing sectors.


Yet, the sustainability of this position is under growing pressure. The Call for Evidence stresses that
Europe’s competitive edge in mainstream chips is challenged by ‘potential non-market policies
and practices in third countries’ and warns that continuous innovation is required to maintain
security-relevant and energy-efficient components.


Several studies point to structural risks in the European industrial chain. Among these studies,
Huggins et al. (2023) show that Europe’s cluster-based semiconductor industry suffers from
fragmented innovation networks and underinvestment in open-innovation capabilities, limiting
the scaling of next-generation technologies and constraining the diffusion of R&D between
regional clusters such as Leuven, Dresden, Grenoble, and Eindhoven. Poitiers and Weil (2021)
argue that EU policy remains overly focused on advanced-node fabrication, despite Europe’s

10


limited domestic demand for leading-edge logic and its clear strengths in equipment, materials,
and mid-range manufacturing; they warn that diverting public resources towards costly advanced
fabs risks weakening Europe’s competitive position in the mainstream segments where it already
leads.


Additional vulnerabilities arise from global demand shifts and supply-chain exposure. JRC data
show that European end-users depend heavily on imports for certain memory and logic
components, with limited substitutability from domestic production; at the same time, the highest
share of chip segments to Europe goes to the automotive and industrial sectors (37%), both
structurally reliant on mainstream technologies. Xiong et al. (2025) highlight that global shocks
(pandemics, geopolitical tensions, and bottlenecks in ATP and materials) disproportionately affect
mature-node chips, which often have single-sourced supply chains and long recovery times,
increasing Europe’s exposure to disruptions in Asia-centred ATP networks.


While an EU-level chips strategy is indispensable, its effectiveness ultimately depends on fully
understanding the heterogeneity of structural weaknesses that exist within individual Member
States. As Pierleoni (2023) notes for the Italian case, a significant limitation is the shortage of largescale applied-research centres. This challenge is not unique to Italy. Some recent national
assessments, such as Poland’s 2025 semiconductor Strategy (Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs,
2025) similarly highlight gaps in front-end and back-end infrastructure, limited pilot-line capacity,
and fragmented national data on semiconductor capabilities, despite areas of excellence in design,
photonics, and materials. Recognising these heterogenous national constraints is essential for
designing a long-term European chips strategy that strengthens Europe’s collective capabilities
while supporting Member States in overcoming existing deficits that impede the emergence of a
competitive European semiconductor ecosystem.


A forward-looking strategy, therefore, suggests to concentrate policy and resources with the
aim to reinforce Europe’s long-term comparative advantages in the areas of consolidated
excellence.

### 2.3. Supply-chain resilience and economic-security risks: mapping and monitoring tools


The current monitoring framework under the Chips Act remains limited in its capacity to provide
the EU with continuous, granular insights into vulnerabilities across the semiconductor supply
chain. As the Court of Auditors (April 2025) notes, although the Chips Act mandates a strategic
mapping of Europe’s strengths and weaknesses (Article 19) and monitoring (Article 20), it did not
include a clear timetable for the implementation of these actions. Preparatory work began only
after the Act’s entry into force in September 2023, and its operationalization depends on external
technical expertise that seems to not have yet been procured at the time of the audit (Court of
Auditors, 2025, para. 85). However, the importance of the assessment contained in the JRC Report


11


‘EU’s strengths and weaknesses in the global semiconductor sector’ published in March 2025 must
be mentioned in this regard. [3]


Another gap concerns the Commission’s limited visibility over public and private investments.
Financial support for semiconductors flows through a wide range of EU and national channels (EU
Horizon programmes, ESIF, InvestEU, EFSI, EIB lending, national grants, tax incentives, and the
Recovery and Resilience Facility; Court of Auditors, 2025, para. 36). Yet, the Commission cannot
form a complete picture of total funding, because Member State contributions and private
investment decisions are only partially visible, and many funding streams fall outside the
Commission’s direct oversight (Court of Auditors, 2025, paras. 37-40).


This visibility gap extends to implementation. The Commission does not receive systematic
reporting on FOAK or IPCEI projects. It had limited information on semiconductor-relevant projects
for the 2014-2020 period (Court of Auditors, 2025, para. 63). Although DG CNECT’s involvement
in state-aid assessments increased in the 2021-2027 cycle (para. 64), there are still no
requirements for national authorities or beneficiaries to report progress or results to the
Commission (para. 66). For the Chips Act itself, information on expected FOAK investment is
derived largely from “press releases, negotiations underway, and notifications from national
authorities” (para. 45). This leaves the Commission without structured, recurrent access to
information that would allow it to monitor risks in real time or assess how State-aid-funded
projects and new manufacturing investments contribute to resilience.


Furthermore, the report highlights several geopolitical and regulatory risks that affect the EU’s
access to critical technologies and materials and therefore fall squarely within the economicsecurity concerns that a monitoring system should capture. Geopolitical tensions, including
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, have already disrupted supplies of neon gas essential
for lithography (para. 109). Export controls imposed by third countries may “limit access to critical
materials and advanced technology” (para. 110), raising costs and delaying access to key
equipment. Negotiations on such export controls often occur at the Member States rather than
EU level. The recent example of the United States, pressuring the Netherlands to restrict ASML’s
exports to China, well illustrates how external decisions can directly affect the EU’s technological
position.


Although the Call for Evidence does not explicitly refer to risks such as intellectual property theft,
forced technology transfer, or economic espionage, these forms of unauthorized diffusion of
know-how fall squarely within the broader category of vulnerabilities that the Commission seeks
to address through enhanced monitoring and economic-security analysis. The Chips Act
Regulation itself recognises in recitals 27 and 43 “practices aiming to misappropriate confidential
information, trade secrets, and protected data, such as IP theft, forced technology transfers and



3 See also OECD (2023), [Vulnerabili4es in the semiconductor supply chain.](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2023/06/vulnerabilities-in-the-semiconductor-supply-chain_f4de7491/6bed616f-en.pdf)



12


economic espionage” as a threat to Europe’s R&D efforts. In segments where Europe retains
critical strengths (particularly equipment, materials, power semiconductors, sensors, and
photonics) or is heavily investing to develop new ones, unauthorized transfer of know-how would
erode or put at risk Europe’s competitive edge and conversely deepen strategic dependencies on
non-EU suppliers. In this regard, it is worth to point out that the SCAN methodology used to map
trade dependencies (JRC, 2023, 2025), while useful at the product level, is not designed to detect
vulnerabilities linked to proprietary process technologies or exposure of strategic intellectual
assets. Also, as the authors of the report themselves emphasise, customs classifications used in
the SCAN methodology suffer from several limitations, including limited granularity and noise
information that lead to potential challenges when interpretating the data.


Addressing the variety of risks faced by the semiconductors ecosystem requires a monitoring
framework that is not only sufficiently granular, continuous and coordinated across Member
States, but also capable of integrating multiple forms of vulnerability: supply-chain disruptions,
chokepoints in materials and equipment, exposure of proprietary process technologies, and the
impact of foreign direct investment and merger-related remedies. Crucially, as the JRC (2025)
underscores, such a framework depends on systematic input from field experts to validate product
relevance, and on structured cooperation with Member States to ensure comprehensive coverage
of the value chain.


For example, competence centres (Article 11 of the Chips Act) could play a structured role in
addressing existing intelligence gaps. Their technical expertise, proximity to industry, and ability
to gather specialised knowledge communities could allow them, if adequately equipped, to
support the Commission and Member States in validating SCAN-based mappings and interpreting
technological developments that are not captured by trade data. If integrated into a formal
monitoring architecture, with clearly defined analytical tasks, reporting channels, and
confidentiality safeguards, competence centres could contribute to the continuous, more granular
technical insight required to assess supply-chain choke points, technology leakage risks, and
emerging sights in the semiconductor landscape.


The weaknesses of the current monitoring framework also seem to contrast with two examples
of EU oversight regimes in other critical sectors, where the EU has imposed compulsory,
structured, and recurrent data-gathering duties on private actors for the purpose of risk
monitoring, market surveillance, and crisis-response; functions closely aligned with what a
reinforced Chips Act may require:


  - In energy markets, the REMIT Regulation obliges all wholesale market participants to

provide standardized, continuous transaction-level data to ACER for real-time market
integrity surveillance. (See Regulation EU No. 1227/2011 on wholesale energy market
integrity and transparency (REMIT), Articles 4, 7, 8, REMIT Annual Report).


13


  - Under the Critical Raw Materials Act, large companies manufacturing strategic

technologies must provide supply-chain, risk exposure, and supplier-concentration data to
the Commission on a compulsory and recurring basis. The mechanism is explicitly framed
as an early-warning economic-security tool and allows the Commission to request data
from specific firms when supply-risk conditions emerge. See Regulation (EU) 2024/1252,
Articles 20-23.


These frameworks demonstrate that when systemic risks and cross-border interdependencies
justify intervention, the EU already operates by creating binding and enforceable data collection
architectures.


Drawing on Article 24 of the Critical Raw Materials Act, the revised Chips Act could introduce a
proportionate, company-level risk-preparedness obligation for large and strategic firms in the
semiconductors supply and value chain. Periodic assessments of the critical semiconductor
dependencies would provide the Commission and Member States with structured and recurring
insights. Any obligation should be designed to avoid undue administrative burden - applying only
to firms whose scale and/or systemic relevance justify such reporting - respect existing corporate
risk-management processes and remain strictly proportionate.


Finally, beyond addressing present-day supply-chain vulnerabilities, an effective monitoring must
incorporate a structured horizon-scanning function, similar to the exercise carried out by the UK
CMA (2023) in its [Trends in Digital Markets: A CMA Horizon Scanning Report. Semiconductors](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/657ad2ab254aaa0010050d0c/__Trends_in_Digital_Markets__.pdf)
evolve along technological trajectories where critical inflection points, such as breakthroughs in
patterning, materials, or lithography, can rapidly alter cost structures, competitive positions, and
the geographical distribution of manufacturing. For example, Hung (2024) discusses innovations
such as multiple patterning or potential particle-accelerator-based lithography, which seem to
have the capacity to reshape future lithography roadmaps and shift chokepoints within the value
chain, directly affecting Europe’s strategic strengths in equipment and advanced materials.
Without a forward-looking analytical capability, the EU risks basing policy on today’s bottlenecks
while missing emerging technological transitions that could determine future dependence or
competitiveness. Integrating ‘horizon scanning’ methodologies into the Chips Act monitoring
architecture would therefore align with the economic-security objectives, identified by the Court
of Auditors, filling the current gap between reactive crisis-oriented data collection and the
anticipatory intelligence required to guide long-term strategic investment, supply-chain resilience
planning, and capability development.


In summary, the current monitoring system is fragmented, incomplete, and overly dependent on
voluntary or ad hoc information flows. A revised Chips Act should therefore establish
continuous, proportionate, and compulsory data collection, integrated with early-warning
indicators and a horizon-scanning capability. Only with an efficient, complete, and mandatory


14


information tool can the EU aim to anticipate supply shocks, evaluate the effects of public
investment, identify emerging technologies and their impact on the current supply chain, and
support a durable and strategic semiconductor policy framework.

# 3. Assessment of the Commission’s policy options


The Call for Evidence presents two distinct options for the revision of the Chips Act. Their feasibility
and desirability depend on Europe’s structural position in the semiconductor value chain and the
shortcomings identified in the current framework. The CDS considers that each option addresses
parts of the problem, but their effectiveness diverges substantially given economic, institutional,
and geopolitical constraints.


3.1. Option 1: Maintaining the current framework


Under this option, the regulatory structure and the state-aid principles established in the Chips
Act would be preserved, without additional investments from the EU or enhanced mandatory
monitoring regime. Data gathering from private actors would remain voluntary (except in crisis
situations under Article 25 in relation to Article 23).


Option 1 risks preserving the weaknesses already identified (limited impact on leading-edge
dependence, insufficient monitoring capability, and a strategic framework too weak to guide
future interventions). Also, evidence from the Court of Auditors confirms that the current
voluntary and fragmented data-gathering system leaves the Commission without the complete
information set needed to implement the Act effectively. Under Option 1, these structural
deficiencies would remain unaddressed.


3.2. Option 2: Targeted amendments to the Chips Act


This option would amend the Chips Act Regulation to (i) elevate the strategic nature of both
leading-edge and legacy manufacturing; (ii) define strategic projects and selection criteria; (iii)
expand future funding possibilities beyond State aid, and (iv) introduce enhanced, potentially
mandatory, data-gathering tools for resilience and economic-security monitoring.


  - _Greater realism and strategic coherence:_ Unlike Option 1, this solution seems to better

reflect that Europe’s vulnerabilities extend beyond dependence in terms of leading-edge
chips to critical legacy nodes. A revised Act that would foresee strategic projects could


15


focus support where Europe has a plausible comparative advantage and avoid
misallocation toward structurally uncompetitive advanced node fabs.

  - Scope for differentiated interventions: Option 2 explicitly allows for tailored instruments,

from small-scale, security-oriented production for defence, space, and automotive, to
(where justified) participation in high-volume advanced-node projects. This flexibility aligns
with the CDS’ view that Europe’s requirements for leading-edge chips are mission-critical,
and sector-specific, but most importantly relatively low-volume, and hence largely
incompatible with a purely commercial big foundry model. The case for Option 2 is further
reinforced by the market heterogeneity of national semiconductor ecosystems, briefly
recalled in section 2.2. A framework built around strategic projects and differentiated
instruments is therefore better suited to Europe’s existing heterogeneity.

  - Strengthening monitoring and economic-security intelligence: Introducing improved,

potentially mandatory, data collection could be a significant impactful improvement as it
would address the core weakness identified throughout section 2.3: the absence of
continuous, structured, and Member-State-integrated intelligence necessary for resilience
and economic-security assessments.


Option 2, therefore, seems to be more suitable for correcting the structural weaknesses identified
in the current Chips Act.

# 4. CDS Recommendations


The revision of the Chips Act should strengthen Europe’s semiconductor strategy by combining
greater industry initiative with more strategically targeted public intervention. Europe’s
semiconductor capabilities must be developed not in isolation but as part of a broader, layered
digital ecosystem: from raw materials and energy, through chips, networks, connected devices,
cloud infrastructure, software, data, and AI. Strengthening any one layer depends on coordinated
progress across the others. This perspective, which illustrates the vast need for future investment,
reinforces the view that while Europe must enable its industry to act with greater autonomy and
ambition, public resources must be deployed where market forces alone cannot deliver the
necessary capabilities.


Our recommendations are threefold:


First, the revised Chips Act should adopt a realistic approach to leading-edge logic. A credible
European strategy for advanced nodes must be grounded in the structural realities that have
shaped the evolution of the global semiconductor supply and value chain. As section 2.1.
explained, successful participation in leading-edge manufacturing depends on cumulative process
know-how, high-volume demand, specialised labour, deep capital markets, and secure access to


16


critical materials and tools. Investment in advanced nodes is possible, but only if it is paired with
an industrial and economic-security strategy that addresses these underlying conditions, builds
the necessary complementary capabilities, and secures strategic partnerships that mitigate
structural constraints. A revised Chips Act should therefore support advanced-node
investments only where technically and economically justified, while ensuring that they are
embedded in a broader strategic framework that reflects the full complexity of leading-edge
manufacturing.


Second, as discussed in Section 2.2, a revised Chips Act should explicitly recognise the
heterogeneity of national semiconductor ecosystems, so that public resources (both national and
EU) can be deployed more effectively. Deploying Chips Act instruments aligning them with these
heterogenous conditions would ensure that funding, state aid, and EU-level support reinforce
national strengths and avoid distributing resources thinly across areas where complementary
capabilities are missing and where their development requires substantial investment over a
sustained period of time. In particular, an effective and forward-looking strategy should
concentrate available EU resources, and guide member states efforts, towards the areas
where Europe’s long-term comparative advantages are at the same time strategic and
realistic.


Third, a revised Chips Act should establish a structured, proportionate, and compulsory EU-level
data-gathering framework. As discussed in Section 2.3., voluntary reporting has left the
Commission without the complete information required for risk assessment, investment
monitoring, or crisis preparedness. Drawing on mechanisms foreseen by the REMIT and the Critical
Raw Materials Act, the improved monitoring framework could integrate SCAN-based mapping,
with firm-level reporting for large and strategically relevant actors, complemented by structured
cooperation with Member States and competence centres. Without an improved mapping and
monitoring framework, other policy interventions risk being misaligned or misallocated.


The overarching message is that Europe’s semiconductor policy must combine a more active
industry with a more strategic state. Industry must act, and must be enabled to act, but public
resources must be directed where they can have the greatest impact, informed by a much clearer
picture of Europe’s and its Member State’s position in the global value chain, and by a monitoring
framework capable of informing long-term strategic decisions rather than simply reacting to crises.
