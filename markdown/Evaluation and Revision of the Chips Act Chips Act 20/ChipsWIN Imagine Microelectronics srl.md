feedback: The actions implemented in the Chips Act till now appear to be very much
  top-down driven by large corporates and/or large RTO's and the role of SME's and
  smaller organizations appears to have been overshadowed by those big players. At
  ChipsWIN (the Walloon Chips Competence Centre), we think that SME's and startups
  are an essential part in reviving the semiconductors in Europe. They will provide
  the local anchoring which big players fail to provide as they consider their playing
  fields as the global market. In our consultations we have seen that SME's and startups
  experience high (financial / investments) thresholds when wanting to bring an innovation
  to the market. Solutions are needed enabling a ramp-up from few prototypes as pilot-lines
  and RTO's may support, to larger numbers necessary to convince bigger players to
  adopt / support the innovative process or design. Access to shared infrastructures
  allowing SME's or startups to run proprietary processing or testing for a time at
  a limited cost is seen as an important enabler.
