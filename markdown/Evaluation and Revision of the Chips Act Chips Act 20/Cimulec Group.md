feedback: The objective of the European Chip Act reflects a strong desire to strengthen
  the independence of Europe's electronics industry. Within this value chain, the
  PCB is one of the most critical links. This product, which defines all the electrical
  connections that link each chip and component, embodies a significant portion of
  the expertise of design offices. Each PCB is linked to a single function, and therefore,
  even though PCB factories employ only 14,000 people in Europe, they are directly
  connected to all electronics design offices. We are beginning to see significant
  growth in Asia in the supply of pre-wired printed circuit boards (PCBs + PCBAs),
  suggesting an increase in the added value of electronic functions. This strategy,
  which we've seen in the telephony and solar panel sectors (now almost entirely manufactured
  in Asia), risks being repeated. The difference will be that we'll be dealing with
  sectors such as our defense, healthcare, and mobility electronics industries. It
  is imperative to integrate PCBs and PCBAs into the European Chip Act 2 if we don't
  want to miss the objective of strengthening our electronic independence.
