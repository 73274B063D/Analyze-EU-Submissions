feedback: 'The revision of the Chips Act represents a decisive step toward consolidating
  Europes technological autonomy. However, for the goal of semiconductor sovereignty
  to become truly attainable, the European strategy must address a structural vulnerability
  that the first Chips Act did not adequately consider: the absence of a dedicated
  industrial policy for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and Printed Circuit Board
  Assembly (PCBA) value chain. Without a strong, competitive and technologically advanced
  European capability in this field, the substantial investments allocated to semiconductor
  manufacturing risk remaining incomplete, because chips only become functional when
  integrated into physical substrates, interconnections and assembly processes that
  today depend almost entirely on non-European markets. Global PCB production is overwhelmingly
  concentrated in Asia, resulting in a loss of European skills, competitiveness and
  industrial resilience, and this dependency concerns not only finished products but
  also the upstream materials essential for PCB manufacturing laminates, resins, treated
  glass fibers, copper clads and other semi-finished products. The absence of a strategy
  for PCB manufacturing constitutes a fundamental industrial risk. Europes most strategic
  sectors defense, aerospace, space systems, AI, secure communications, medical technologies
  cannot rely on components that are neither produced nor controllable within the
  Union. High-reliability boards embody unique know-how, intellectual property and
  manufacturing processes; the outsourcing of such capabilities compromises both competitiveness
  and security. For this reason, Europe should also actively support European companies
  that already supply not only the strategic sectors mentioned above but are also
  capable today of providing advanced and complex technologies, including rigid-flex
  and HDI thereby enabling the development of the next generation of technologies
  such as future UltraHDI structures and IC substrates. Chips Act 2.0 is therefore
  the opportunity to correct this strategic oversight. The European policy must evolve
  from supporting the silicon-centric phase of the value chain to recognizing and
  strengthening the entire ecosystem that makes semiconductor functionality available
  in sophisticated electronic systems. The PCB and PCBA value chain must be acknowledged
  as an essential pillar of Europes technological sovereignty. For these reasons,
  the Commission is strongly encouraged to formally recognize PCB and PCBA manufacturing,
  together with the associated materials and production equipment, as strategic assets;
  to allocate dedicated funding and to promote an industrial policy consistent with
  Europes wider technological sovereignty ambitions. Only through an integrated and
  forward-looking approach will Europe be able to build an electronic ecosystem that
  is truly autonomous, resilient and globally competitive.'
