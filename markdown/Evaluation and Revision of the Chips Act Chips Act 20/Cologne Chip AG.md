feedback: The Chips Act has the problem not to include the chips customers (device
  making industry) and there is no or too few co-investment from public money investors
  involved. Furthermore the process is two slow and has much bureaucracy. Most important
  is that compared with USA there is no Build EU/ Buy EU act is in place. Nobody in
  the chips using industry is redeveloping a device with EU components when the original
  component is available. So the good idea of supply chain resilience is not transformed
  into reality.
