# **Chips Act 2.0: From emergency response** **to strategic industry development**

## **Executive summary**


The next European Chips Act must evolve from an emergency response into a strategic industrial
policy that makes Europe competitive, indispensable and resilient within the global semiconductor
ecosystem. It should be guided by realistic, market-driven objectives and strengthen the entire
semiconductor value chain.


Geopolitical tensions over semiconductor technologies and critical inputs have increased and threats of
supply disruptions persist, as the Nexperia case illustrates. [1] Projects under the existing Chips Act [2] have
advanced unevenly, funding is still fragmented and business conditions in Europe remain challenging for
critical parts of the semiconductor value chain. Other regions – especially the US, Japan, South Korea and
China – now combine vast incentives with clear industrial strategies.


Europe needs a bold Chips Act 2.0 that fully aligns EU and Member States’ efforts to make Europe an
attractive destination for global semiconductor investments and meet expected demand. Industry strongly
supports Member States’ call for an ambitious revision of the Chips Act to revitalise Europe’s semiconductor
ecosystem. The Semiconductor Declaration’s three strategic priorities – prosperity, indispensability,
resilience – provide a solid foundation for this renewed ambition. [3]


Europe’s objective cannot be self-sufficiency but must be indispensability: becoming a global leader that
the world relies on for critical technologies, skills and innovation. Europe should invest where it already
holds a competitive edge or can realistically catch up. For this, a centralised EU financing instrument for
strategic semiconductor projects is essential to boost the EU’s future competitiveness and security. Where
direct competition with global market leaders is not viable, the EU should build reliable partnerships globally
to secure access to key semiconductor technologies and supplies. [4]

To achieve prosperity, indispensability and resilience, the next Chips Act should be guided by five priorities:


**Smart investment and speed** : Pool EU, national and private funding to mobilise €200 billion for

semiconductor investments by 2035, whilst cutting approval times for strategic European projects
to under seven months. Establish a central EU semiconductor budget line of at least €20bn under
the European Competitiveness Fund to ensure critical mass and coordination. [5]


**Demand creation and scale:** Shift from a supply-driven approach to a long-term strategy that

addresses actual market demand for semiconductors and builds on Europe’s existing strengths in
the microelectronics ecosystem. By 2030, launch five semiconductor alliances linking chip makers
with key sectors to stimulate demand, investment and innovation in coordination with downstream
industries such as industrials, automotive, energy, defence, healthcare, telecoms, data centres, and
AI applications, including industrial and edge AI.


**Global indispensability** : Focus investment and support on areas where Europe can lead – for

example, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, innovation at mature node sizes, chiplets,
photonics and advanced materials – whilst expanding partnerships with trusted economies and
investing strategically in underdeveloped yet promising areas to leap ahead (e.g., quantum chips). [6]


**Skills and framework conditions** : Make Europe an attractive destination for semiconductor

investments. Introduce coordinated, EU-wide tax incentives, train and attract the people needed to
fill Europe’s semiconductor workforce gap, and ensure fast-track permitting, affordable energy and
infrastructure.


**Sustainability** : Make energy-efficient chips and circular manufacturing Europe’s hallmark

contribution to the global industry.


Success should be measured not in global market share, but in Europe’s relevance to the world, its ability
to innovate, attract investment, meet demand, shape standards and lead in technology deployment. With
clear objectives that reflect the needs of both the semiconductor ecosystem and downstream sectors, a
second-generation Chips Act can turn Europe’s semiconductor policy from a defensive subsidy scheme
into a forward-looking industrial strategy that drives competitiveness and resilience across value chains.


Europe has the ideas, expertise and industrial potential, but lacks focus, scale and speed.
**DIGITALEUROPE’s European AI and Tech Declaration** shows that with strong public-private
partnerships, Europe can lead globally in critical technologies like semiconductors. [7] The next Chips Act
must replace aspiration with execution – coordinating investment, tightening governance and linking
innovation directly to industrial demand.


5 COM(2025) 555 final.

partnerships globally to secure access to essential semiconductor technologies and supplies. See

## **Lessons from the first Chips Act**

The first Chips Act injected political momentum to realise Europe’s semiconductor ambitions but failed to
create the coordinated industrial strategy that global competitors for semiconductor investments already
had. [8] Its emergency-era design revealed structural weaknesses now impossible to ignore.


The EU adopted a top-down target of 20 per cent of global manufacturing capacity in value in the Digital
Decade. [9] It has become clear that we remain far off this goal, and that we do not have an action plan based
on industry needs to achieve it. [10] Consequently, Member States have recognised that the target is both
‘unrealistic and too broad, lacking clear strategic direction on where and why Europe should lead in the
semiconductor value chain.’ [11]


Across all analyses of the Chips Act runs a single message: Europe has ideas, expertise and industrial
potential, but lacks focus, scale and speed. The next Chips Act must replace aspiration with execution –
coordinating investment, tightening governance and linking innovation directly to industrial demand.


We urge the European Commission to co-develop this strategy together with the semiconductor ecosystem
and the involvement of sectorial end-users. A successful European semiconductor strategy must be
grounded in real demand, reflect the realities of global production, avoid fragmentation, leverage Europe’s
competitive advantages and make Europe a leading hub for semiconductor investment and talent.

### **European Court of Auditors findings**


The auditors’ special report on the EU Chips Act finds that, whilst the Chips Act has provided new
momentum for Europe’s semiconductor sector, it is highly unlikely to deliver on its headline goal of reaching
20 per cent global market share by 2030. [12] The Chips Act lacked a demand analysis and was drafted without
a full impact assessment. The Commission controls only a fraction of available funding (about €4.5 billion)
whilst Member States managed the bulk through insufficiently coordinated state aid. This fragmentation
dilutes scale and leaves the EU without a clear picture of where investments were going.


According to the auditors, implementation progress is mixed: Pillar I (research and innovation capacity) is
advancing but faces some delays. [13] Pillar II (FOAK manufacturing) has seen slow uptake and some
setbacks, with seven FOAK projects approved so far, totalling €10.2 billion in state aid and €21 billion in
private investments. The framework for Pillar III (monitoring and crisis response) is not fully operational and
faces significant implementation challenges. [14]


8 See US CHIPS Act and RAPIDUS Project in Japan, which successfully attracted private investment

and built manufacturing capacity by offering incentives through subsidy schemes, tax incentives and
direct public support, or by forming industry consortia.


9 Decision (EU) 2022/2481.


10 The Commission’s most recent forecasts (COM(2025) 290 final) suggest only a modest increase

from 9.6 per cent in 2022 to 11.6 per cent by 2030.

### **Council position and Semiconductor Coalition**

The Declaration of the Semiconductor Coalition, adopted by Member States on 29 September, demands a
‘strengthened, second-phase EU Chips Act’ grounded in three strategic objectives of prosperity,
indispensability and resilience.


Member States stressed the need to align national, European and private funding streams, speed up certain
funding decisions, improve access to funding for startups and scaleups, and mobilise more private capital.
However, there is no commitment on the size of a new EU-level semiconductor budget, only the ambition
to ‘ensure that the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) as of 2028 reflects the importance of
strategic sectors and technologies such as semiconductors.’ [15]


Member States proposed a balanced approach that supports the development of cutting-edge chips (a ‘EU
semiconductor value chain for AI’), while also addressing industrial demand for innovative foundational
microchips that are critical to sectors such as mobility, energy, defence, and the green transition.
International partnerships with like-minded countries would be ‘crucial to ensure an open, connected and
secure semiconductor supply chain and strengthening the innovation ecosystem.’ [16]


EU governments also recognised necessary pre-conditions for the EU semiconductor industry (including
permitting, nitrogen supply, grid access, power supply, housing and infrastructure). They committed to
explore emergency permitting legislation to fast-track strategic investments (such as via a new, fast-track
Important Projects of Common European Interest mechanism). They also recommend the launch of a
European Chips Skills Programme and to further develop the EU Chips Design Platform.

### **Recommendations in the Draghi report**


The 2024 Draghi report also called for a more strategic European approach to reduce dependencies on
semiconductors and strengthen capabilities in areas where the EU has or can build a competitive edge. [17]
The report proposed an expanded Chips Act with a larger and centralised EU budget, tax incentives for
design capabilities and fabless companies, subsidies for foundries in strategic segments (especially in
larger nodes for automotive, manufacturing and network equipment), and support for innovative production
stages like back-end 3D advanced packaging, advanced materials and finishing processes.


Draghi also recommended a new fast-track IPCEI for chip-related projects, supporting European
consolidation and leadership in semiconductor manufacturing equipment (lithography, depositions, etc.), a
friendly EU-wide permitting regime, a long-term EU quantum chips plan, a ‘Tech Skills Acquisition
Programme’ featuring special visas for skilled professionals, EU-wide scholarships and early-industry
placements to build and retain world-class expertise in advanced electronics and semiconductors.

### **DIGITALEUROPE assessment of the Chips Act**

The Chips Act laid important groundwork by enabling state aid for strategic projects and launching the
FOAK (first-of-a-kind) framework, which helped catalyse investment into both leading and mature nodes.


However, the Chips Act’s design and implementation revealed several shortcomings:


Industry was insufficiently consulted in its development. As a result, key challenges such as high

operational costs, demand forecasting and dependencies on upstream inputs were overlooked.


The focus was put on increasing manufacturing capacity as a percentage compared to other regions,

rather than boosting innovation and strengthening European competitiveness.


Cooperation across Member States has been slow, and both the Commission and the

Semiconductor Board lack the authority to ensure proper alignment or set strategic priorities.


Available funding has been too fragmented and modest to match global competition. The state aid

process proved too complex and slow to deliver timely support.


Differences in national procedures and approaches taken by Member States to support Pillar II

projects added complexity and led to delays in the Commission’s approval of state aid.


The FOAK scope was narrowly designed, excluding key parts of the value chain such as upstream

materials and chemicals, critical design capabilities, printed circuit board manufacturing,
downstream packaging capacities and systems integration.


Even though the Design Centres of Excellence represent a promising idea, their role remains

underdeveloped and relevant delegated acts have not been adopted.


Efforts to build reliable partnerships with trusted third countries – to coordinate support measures,

address supply chain vulnerabilities, and pursue joint R&I objectives – have fallen short amid
heightened geopolitical and trade tensions.


Overall, targets were vague and unrealistic. This created difficulties in steering the implementation

of the act, defining strategic projects and coordinating Member State action.


A revised Chips Act must directly address these challenges to ensure Europe becomes globally competitive
and, as a result, an indispensable player in the semiconductor ecosystem.

## **New targets for a revised Chips Act**


The first Chips Act measured progress by a single, misleading number: 20 per cent of global market share
for Europe until 2030. [18] Europe needs a more practical compass. The EU’s next targets must reflect
strategic relevance, not production quotas. Progress should be measured by Europe’s ability to innovate,
attract investment and talent, and shape global semiconductor networks – indispensability, not isolation,
defines success.


18 Member States have recognised in the _Declaration of the Semicon Coalition_ that the target is both

‘unrealistic and too broad, lacking clear strategic direction on where and why Europe should lead in
the semiconductor value chain.’

## **DIGITALEUROPE Recommendations**

### **Boost smart and strategic investment**

Europe’s semiconductor funding landscape remains fragmented, slow and modest compared to global
competitors. The US, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China have launched long-term programmes
combining massive incentives with predictable governance and tax frameworks. [20] By contrast, the EU still
relies on uncoordinated national subsidies, complex state-aid procedures and limited central resources. [21] If
Europe wants to be an attractive location for chip research, design and manufacturing, investment must be
faster, larger and strategically directed.


Investment decisions must build on Europe’s existing strengths rather than duplicating efforts. In this
context, the European Commission’s envisioned focus on ‘AI chip’ production in Europe raises concerns,
particularly if it implies subsidising European production of GPUs in the range of below 5nm. Such an
initiative would require very large public investments as well as attracting leading foreign companies willing
to grow their manufacturing capacity. It would also require nurturing an advanced manufacturing ecosystem
in Europe to provide key inputs, which increases the complexity, costs and related investment risks.


The EU currently does not have a strong internal market for chips with the smallest node sizes because
sectors such as automotive, energy and industrial automation rely primarily on mature chips, typically 28nm
and larger. Accordingly, the supply disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic were not caused by shortages
of cutting-edge chips but by a lack of mainstream chips in the 65-90nm range. Survey data from 2022 to
2024 confirms that most projected demand remains for mature nodes above 28nm. In addition, over 30 per
cent of mainstream chips are currently imported from China, and the Joint Research Centre has identified
a trade deficit of around six billion euros in both advanced and mature chips, a gap that is expected to widen
given their importance in green transition technologies. [22]


To transform Europe into a top destination for international semiconductor investment, DIGITALEUROPE
recommends:


**Member States need to allocate at least €20bn to a centralised EU-level semiconductor**

**budget under the next Multi-annual Financial Framework (2028-2034),** integrated within the
European Competitiveness Fund and Horizon Europe and drawing on all four envisioned technology
windows to reflect the cross-cutting, foundational nature of chips. [23] The budget would enable the EU
to match Member States’ investments, as is already the case in the context of the Chips Joint
Undertaking. This co-funding approach should be expanded to Pillar II projects, allowing the EU a
bigger stake in funding strategic semiconductor projects across Europe.


20 The US Chips and Science Act allocates around €267 billion over ten years; Japan’s RAPIDUS aims

to produce 2 nm chips by 2027 and Taiwan targets 80 per cent of global advanced semiconductor
manufacturing by 2033. Many of these strategies include substantial tax incentives, which the EU
currently lacks.

21 According to the European Court of Auditors, the Commission directly controls only €4.5 billion of

Chips Act public funding, whilst €21.9 billion is managed nationally for FOAK facilities and €8.1 billion
through the 2023 IPCEI on microelectronics. This fragmentation limits scale and coordination.

**The** **centralised semiconductor budget needs to prioritise strategic European projects,**

**aligned with national and private funding streams** . Crowding-in of private investment is key for
Pillar II projects aimed at increasing European manufacturing capacity to meet projected demand.
Funding should be allocated based on demonstrated excellence and strategic relevance. This
includes doubling down on EU strengths across process technologies (e.g., lithography, atomic
layer deposition), chip design (e.g., SoCs for 6G and edge AI), MEMS (e.g., sensors), advanced
materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes and high-frequency, high-voltage, non-fossil and biocompatible
materials), photonics (e.g., laser and XR technologies) and analogue technologies.


**Broaden the innovation concept** : The Chips Act 2.0 must broaden what counts as innovation on

‘novel chips’ beyond the pursuit of ever smaller node sizes. Increasing energy efficiency at mature
node sizes, novel chiplet architectures as well as quantum, neuromorphic and photonic chips should
be supported in Europe all the way to industrial adoption. Enabling further scaling down of chiplet
technologies to lower complexities at competitive price points for heterogeneous integration and
industrial applications (even in edge computing) could boost EU competitiveness.


**Centralise, simplify and speed up funding decisions:** Long wait times for funding decisions

decrease the EU’s attractiveness as an investment destination. The next Chips Act needs to cap
approval times for strategic projects, particularly under IPCEIs and FOAK projects, to 7 months from
the submission of applications for Pillar II projects to the signature of the state aid agreement.


**Expand the scope of First-of-a-kind (FOAK) projects:** The narrow definition of FOAK has

contributed to the delays in approving state aid projects. Eligibility for FOAK projects should
therefore be expanded. EU competitiveness and resilience can only be strengthened through a
resilient upstream supply chain (e.g., chemicals, equipment and materials suppliers). The same
applies downstream (e.g., printed circuit board manufacturing) and assembly, testing and packing.
In addition, Pillar II state aid should also be available for the modernisation of European fabs (e.g.,
through the deployment of industrial AI to improve productivity, quality and green production).


**Investment tax credits and targeted tax breaks:** To compete globally, the EU must complement

grants with coordinated tax incentives for operational costs and capital expenditures. These
incentives are proven instruments to unlock large-scale private investment. In June 2025, the US
increased its semiconductor investment tax credit to 35 per cent (from 25 per cent) for new fabs
breaking ground before 2026, a key driver of private investment. [24] The EU has no equivalent.


**Make better use of existing funding mechanisms** : The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the

European Innovation Council (EIC) need to play a bigger role. This includes larger funding
envelopes, expanded funding eligibility and simplified application procedures. Both institutions have
proven valuable in providing loans, equity investments and advisory services to the semiconductor
sector, but their impact has been limited by rigid risk criteria and complex applications.

### **Encourage demand and scale**


The European electronics systems market is fragmented, with no single player generating the market
demand to attract sustained semiconductor investment. To secure its place in global value chains, Europe
must better link the semiconductor ecosystem with high-volume industrial demand. This means coupling
innovation in chip design and manufacturing with the needs of end-users and system makers, ensuring that
investment risks are shouldered together and semiconductor breakthroughs translate into commercial
success in downstream sectors.


24 The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1) raised the advanced manufacturing investment credit from 25

per cent to 35 per cent. The legislation also restored full deductibility of domestic R&D expenses and
made permanent the modified deduction for foreign-derived intangible income.

Fostering demand creation and early adoption of innovative chips made in Europe is key to overcoming the
return on investment dilemma. The Commission and Member States need to support industry-led vertical
alliances and consortia that bring together chip providers and end-users, enabling co-development and
rapid scaling of next-generation technologies.


**Launch** **five European industry alliances by 2030** that connect the semiconductor ecosystem

with key verticals (automotive, energy/renewables, defence and connectivity). These alliances
would serve as platforms for co-innovation and anchor demand, aligning chip manufacturers, system
integrators and end-users to accelerate the design and adoption of advanced European chips. [25]
Each alliance should be designed to stimulate demand, ensuring a stable market pull for new
semiconductor technologies developed in Europe. These alliances can bridge the pillars of the Chips
Act, linking research (including by imec, CEA-Leti and Fraunhofer) with manufacturing capacity.
Dedicated clusters of industry experts associated with the Design Centres can support these
consortia. Joint purchasing mechanisms should be avoided because the high differentiation of
semiconductor products will make this demand aggregation challenging, slow and uncompetitive.


**Create a dedicated funding instrument for chip-to-system acceleration.** A key gap between

Pillar I and II of the Chips Act is the lack of a dedicated funding instrument to bridge innovation within
the semiconductor ecosystem and commercialisation in downstream sectors. The Commission
should extend existing funding programmes to include ‘chip-to-system acceleration’ projects that
take ideas the full way to industrial deployment. This also requires addressing chip design not in
isolation but as part of systems design and reflecting this broader challenge in the setup of the
Design Centres.


**Strengthen chips pilot lines through involvement of downstream sectors:** Current pilot lines

are predominately labs used for research and predevelopment, rarely supporting small volume
production series. A seamless link to industrial mass production remains tentative at best. A genuine
‘lab-to-market’ concept requires the involvement of the industry all the way to large-scale chip users
(across industrial, automotive, mobility, energy, digital infrastructure and other key sectors).


**Facilitate the formation of strong verticals by supporting further investments in digital thread**

**technologies** . Digital thread technologies ensure the availability of trusted data along the
semiconductor value chain, which is key to boost both productivity and resilience. Yet, this
technology requires significant investment in data integration, analytics and collaboration tools
(covering all sites, chip and PCB design, manufacturing and customers).

### **Make Europe indispensable in global value chains**


The renewed Chips Act’s guiding principle should be indispensability: ensuring that Europe’s strengths are
essential to the global semiconductor ecosystem. Indispensability means being globally competitive and
leading in technologies and capabilities without which global supply chains cannot function.


To apply this principle, Europe must take a strategic and positive approach to global value chains. Instead
of reacting to vulnerabilities and choke points, policy should focus on building European assets that the
world depends on, turning interdependence into influence. Member States should therefore clarify the roles
of the public and private sectors in strengthening Europe’s semiconductor position, supported by a
comprehensive mapping of existing strengths in research, manufacturing, equipment and design to inform
where Europe can lead.


25 The Semiconductor declaration called for ‘strong complementary European industrial alliances’ to

support commercialisation and strengthen EU competitiveness.

Europe’s ambition should target long-term leadership in globally relevant and specialised technologies,
those that combine scientific excellence, industrial scale and sustainability advantages. The revised Chips
Act should:


**Prioritise support for areas** **where Europe is or should become indispensable**, such as chip

design (e.g., edge AI and 6G chips), electronic design automation (EDA) tools, foundational
semiconductors (e.g., MEMS/sensors), semiconductor manufacturing equipment (lithography),
advanced materials and process innovations (e.g., atomic layer deposition), as well as specialised
chips for key applications such as mobility, industrials, AI, aerospace, medical and electrification.


**Protect Europe’s strengths in mature node manufacturing,** which underpins automotive, energy

and defence sectors. European producers have come under increasing competitive pressure from
non-market policies and practices in third countries. If Europe fails to invest in its existing strengths,
it risks losing an important foothold in the semiconductor ecosystem and the associated industrial
know-how in the value chain. The next Chips Act must improve conditions for the design and
manufacturing of mainstream chips, recognising them as an asset for European resilience and
competitiveness across downstream sectors, including their essential nature for defence
applications.


**Accelerate the development of chip design ecosystems.** Build design capabilities and

intellectual property by supporting fabless design business models. Leverage competence centres
to better connect existing European design clusters. This requires expanding the scope of Design
Centres of Excellence, ensuring the participation of startups, SMEs and large companies focused
on state-of-the-art chip design and architecture and EDA tools. [26]


**Finance the increased use of AI for chips design** . Increasing productivity when it comes to chips

design is also critical to meet the challenges of skills shortages and the growing cost of design and
verification of leading-edge chips designs. The integration of AI in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) and Electronic Components and Systems (ECS) tools is one of the key enablers to
successfully meet these challenges and should therefore receive EU funding support.


**Provide increased funding support for disruptive technologies** like neuromorphic, photonic,

quantum or memristor technologies that can make Europe indispensable in future markets. Chipletbased architectures should be further developed and supported beyond the actions already in place
in the EU Chips Act.


**Develop strategic advanced packaging capabilities.** Europe currently does not have substantial

advanced assembly and packaging capabilities, creating dependencies as revealed by the Nexperia
case. This requires increased automation to overcome labour cost differentials. [27] The EU needs to
support R&I, capital investment and operational cost during a starting period to incentivise
investments in Europe. These facilities need to collaborate closely with end-users to ensure that
developments reflect market needs.


**Support the development of green chips and sustainable manufacturing techniques.** This

should include R&I and deployment incentives for energy-efficient chips, green energy applications,
circularity, integrated photonics, heterogeneous integration, sustainable materials, renewable
energy use, safer substances and resource efficiency across the value chain.


26 Positive examples include the Bavarian Chip Design Centre, part of the Fraunhofer network.


27 The labour-intensive assembly, test and packaging market segment is concentrated in low-cost

areas of the world (predominately Taiwan, China, South Korea and Malaysia), meaning only
increased automation can bridge the cost gap.

### **Enhance coordination, governance and industry engagement**

The next Chips Act must streamline decision-making on semiconductor policy. Governance remains
fragmented across multiple actors and fora, diluting the impact of EU policy and funding.


Member State experts meet in the Semiconductor Board, which has faced significant challenges in
coordinating national and EU-level initiatives. Industry is supposed to feed into the Board via the Industrial
Alliance on Semiconductors, which has not been an effective instrument for stakeholder consultation. The
main vehicle to administer EU-level funding under Pillar I is the Chips Joint Undertaking. Yet, Member
States and regions make their own decisions on projects to support with national funds. State aid decisions
under Pillar II fall under the authority of the Directorate-General for Competition. IPCEIs have their own
coordination mechanisms. The European Investment Bank Group and European Innovation Council, which
provide funding support, have separate processes.


Effective governance and implementation should include:


**An empowered Semiconductor Board to ensure real coordination across Member States** .

Considering Member States’ shared ambition, coordination mechanisms need to be strengthened
to better align national chips plans. [28] The EU needs increased pooling of national funding to achieve
critical mass for projects of strategic relevance for Europe, increased collaboration to avoid
additional regulatory burdens. A consolidated and transparent overview of all semiconductor
investments and funding options across the Union is needed. Current arrangements leave the
Commission with only partial oversight of funding.


**Strengthen and broaden the Industrial Alliance on Semiconductors.** Industry must play a

central role in advising on priorities, informing strategic choices and guiding investments, potentially
via direct representation at the Board. The Industrial Alliance on Semiconductors needs to be made
more relevant, including by including end-user industries.


**Streamline and simplify complex approval and permitting procedures** . Differences in national

procedures to support Pillar II projects add complexity and delay the allocation of state aid. A better
aligned or centrally coordinated, fast-track permitting process for strategic EU investment projects
could reduce time-to-market and thereby better position Europe in the chips investment cycle.


**Reconsider implementation of Pillar III and new data-gathering tools.** New measures must

avoid additional reporting burdens. DIGITALEUROPE strictly rejects mandatory information sharing
from undertakings along the semiconductor supply chain to public authorities, noting the risks of
sharing confidential and sensitive business information such as detailed supply and demand
planning. More fundamentally, we question the purpose of providing information such as the
proposed ‘early warning indicators’ mentioned in the Call for Evidence (percentage increase in lead
times, specific price thresholds, or the unavailability of a non-substitutable component), and how
public authorities would be able to interpret such complex and highly context-specific market signals
in order to determine appropriate policy interventions.


**Ensure regulatory coherence** : The drafting and implementation of the Chips Act should align

closely with other EU legislation such as the upcoming Quantum Act, Advanced Materials Act,
Cloud and AI Development Act and defence initiatives to guarantee a smooth interplay and strong
complementarity across policy domains.

### **Strengthen reliable international cooperation and security**

Semiconductors are the most globalised industrial ecosystem in existence. No region possesses end-toend capabilities. Europe’s competitiveness depends on remaining deeply connected to trusted partners
whilst managing security and resilience risks intelligently.


The EU should deepen semiconductor partnerships with trusted economies – the US, Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan and India – linking joint R&I, reciprocal market access and coordinated investment-screening and
export-control regimes. The revised Chips Act should:


**Lay the foundations to agree at least 5 new strategic technology partnership agreements**

**with key international partners until 2035.** New and more ambition partnerships are needed to
promote co-investments and joint ventures with global leaders in line with the principle of open
strategic autonomy. This could, for example, include closer collaboration with Japan on the
RAPIDUS project to diversify supply and guarantee future access to cutting-edge semiconductors.


**Ensure a harmonised and well-coordinated EU approach to export controls, investment**

**screening and trade defence to prevent fragmentation** . Divergent national rules deter investors
and fragment markets. A single EU approach under the Dual-Use Regulation, aligned with allies,
can protect sensitive technologies without stifling trade. [29]


**Lead the development of international standards**, rather than taking unilateral EU action. The

development of harmonised standards should follow an inclusive and technology-neutral approach
without undermining market access.


**Enhance the role of semiconductor related activities in the context of G7, OECD and World**

**Semiconductor Council**, providing frameworks to align policies, drive digital innovation, and
strengthen critical infrastructure and supply chain resilience.

### **Cultivate skills, infrastructure and framework conditions**


Europe needs to ensure the right enabling conditions for the semiconductor industry, ranging from energy
and raw material to talent. If the EU’s semiconductor ambitions are to be realised, this requires a substantial
expansion of the skilled labour pool. Europe already suffers from structural skills shortages and ‘the current
talent gap in the EU semiconductor industry is expected to widen annually by 2030’ because the number of
graduates entering the EU semiconductor industry is not expected to accelerate significantly. [30] The
European Chips Skills Academy estimates that even moderate growth of the European semiconductor
ecosystem would result in 271,400 job openings until 2030.


**Launch a European Chips Skills Programme** aligned with the goals of the Chips Act, the Union

of Skills and relevant actions under Erasmus+ and the DigitalEurope programme. This should
leverage Chips Competence Centres to promote STEM education, vocational training, upskilling
and reskilling initiatives and aim to scale existing public-private collaborations between the
semiconductor industry and educational institutions.


**Improve Single Market mobility for key talent.** As the European Chips Skills Academy

recognised, countries like Spain, Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, and Croatia have a surplus of


29 Regulation (EU) 2021/821.

electrical engineering graduates relative to their semiconductor ecosystems. [31] Member States need
to ensure that these professionals do not face hurdles when trying to relocate to high-demand
regions because of bureaucracy, diverging labour and social security requirements and inconsistent
recognition of professional qualifications.


**Create incentives for talent attraction and retention** by quickly implementing the Blue Carpet

initiative and Choose Europe campaign. The EU also needs to think bigger and introduce incentives
to attract, grow and retain key talent in Europe: coordinated EU-wide talent visas, simple and
transparent rules for cross-border remote work, harmonised treatment of employee stock options
and coordinated tax incentives across Member States.


**Attract leading researchers and build industry-academia joint curriculum activities** . The EU

should use Erasmus+ and other EU funding tool to support the development of new academic
degrees specialised on the next chips technologies, including industry-led modules provided by
industry professionals and time spent in the semiconductor sector.


**Support operational costs of semiconductor manufacturers** : High energy costs remain

challenging for manufacturers in Europe. The EU should explore coordinated, EU-wide tax
incentives for the European semiconductor industry and targeted state support to counteract
Europe’s high energy prices. Ensuring operations are competitive is key to attract investment for the
next round of global capacity building.


**Access to critical raw materials:** Current developments on export controls show that Europe

remains dependent foreign actors for access to critical raw materials. While primarily addressed by
the Critical Raw Materials Act, a dedicated Chips Act R&I stream focused on substitute materials,
material innovation and advanced recycling for semiconductors could help reduce reliance on critical
minerals from foreign sources and strengthen Europe’s sustainability and strategic autonomy. This
should include tangible rewards for adopting sustainable chips production methods in Europe to
ensure quick scaling.
