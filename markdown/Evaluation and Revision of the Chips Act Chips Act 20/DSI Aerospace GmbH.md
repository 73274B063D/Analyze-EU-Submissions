feedback: 'The EU Chips Act is an important step towards keeping Europe competitive
  in the global electronics landscape. But focusing on semiconductors alone wont be
  enough to achieve real technological independence. Between the semiconductor and
  the finished product lies a crucial gap one where Europe is still heavily dependent
  on Asia: the PCB and PCBA sector. In this area, Asian manufacturers not only dominate
  in terms of volume, but in many cases also set the benchmark for technological capability
  and production efficiency. Europe, on the other hand, still struggles to scale up
  and compete in advanced, high-density PCB technologies. To truly strengthen Europes
  position in electronics, we need a holistic approach that covers the entire value
  chain from semiconductor design and manufacturing to PCB production, assembly, testing,
  and system integration. Only by reinforcing every step of this process can Europe
  build a resilient and competitive electronics ecosystem. DSI Aerospace supports
  the EU Chips Act and proposes the outlined expansion of its scope to secure Europes
  supply resilience and technological independence.'
