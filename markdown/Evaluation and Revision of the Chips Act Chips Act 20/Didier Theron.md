feedback: Being involved in research in microelectronics for many years, we need a
  strong European industry in this field, to train a young generation of engineers
  and select among them some talents for research. Research is strongly dependent
  of industry being located in Europe. Microelectronics is a driver for many other
  industry and also our defense end security. Asia and America will not be keen to
  help us in case of crisis. It is essential to ensure our autonomy as much as possible
  within Europe. Tariffs may also be used if necessary to protect our industry.
