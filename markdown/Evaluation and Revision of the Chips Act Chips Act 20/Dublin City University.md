feedback: 'I welcome the opportunity to provide input to DG CONNECT regarding the
  ongoing implementation and future evolution of the EU Chips Act. I would like to
  express strong support for the objectives of the Act and specifically to acknowledge
  the significant progress already achieved under Pillar 1. The establishment of the
  EU Pilot Lines will substantially strengthen Europes semiconductor research and
  innovation ecosystem, enabling advanced prototyping, accelerating technology readiness,
  and supporting industrial uptake. Likewise, the creation of National Competence
  Centressuch as Irelands I-C3will deliver essential technical capabilities, training
  resources, and shared infrastructure that support start-ups and SMEs across the
  Union. Building on these achievements, a key structural constraint must be addressed
  to fully realise the impact of the Chips Act: the acute shortage of skilled personnel
  in integrated circuit (IC) design and semiconductor manufacturing. Despite strong
  ecosystem growth, the supply of graduates, engineers, and researchers remains significantly
  below current and projected industrial demand. Given DG CONNECTs mission to strengthen
  Europes microelectronic leadership, digital autonomy, and support for strategic
  technologies, resolving this skills gap must be a central priority for the next
  phase of the Chips Act. Addressing this constraint is also essential to enhance
  Europes future connectivity and AI capabilities. The following measures are recommended:
  1. Strengthening Semiconductor Education Pathways DG CONNECT should support Member
  States and universities in expanding dedicated IC design and microelectronics pathways
  within engineering programmes. Recommended measures include: a. Funding to develop
  focused undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in IC design and semiconductor
  technology. b. Modernising laboratory and teaching infrastructure. c. Ensuring broad
  access to state-of-the-art electronic design automation (EDA) tools. d. Providing
  funding for undergraduate tape-outs to deliver authentic design-to-silicon experience.
  e. Developing micro-credentials aligned with industry needs. f. Establishing higher-level
  apprenticeships co-developed by universities and industry partners. These initiatives
  will significantly improve student preparedness, increase the attractiveness of
  semiconductor careers, and support DG CONNECTs aims in digital capacity-building
  and technological sovereignty. 2. Expanding Europes Research and Innovation Base
  Sustained support for PhD training and postdoctoral research is critical to maintain
  Europes long-term innovation capacity. Expanded funding streams would: a. Enable
  research groups to grow and strengthen European semiconductor research. b. Attract
  and retain global talent. c. Foster multi-disciplinary teams at the intersection
  of IC design, semiconductor manufacturing, AI applications (cloud, edge, and physical
  systems), and advanced communications technologies. These capabilities align directly
  with DG CONNECTs strategic priorities, including next-generation computing, AI hardware,
  and secure connected systems, and can leverage existing infrastructure such as pilot
  lines and National Competence Centres. 3. Supporting Talent Retention in the EU
  Given global competition for semiconductor expertise, DG CONNECT could encourage
  Member States to consider targeted tax incentives or equivalent retention mechanisms
  for graduates entering the European semiconductor sector. Such measures would help
  retain talent and support the sustainable growth of Europes semiconductor workforce.
  Collectively, these actions will enhance the effectiveness of investments made under
  Pillar 1, strengthen Europes semiconductor talent pipeline, and ensure long-term
  strategic autonomy and competitiveness in microelectronics. I thank DG CONNECT for
  the opportunity to contribute to this consultation and fully support the continuing
  development of the Chips Act.'
