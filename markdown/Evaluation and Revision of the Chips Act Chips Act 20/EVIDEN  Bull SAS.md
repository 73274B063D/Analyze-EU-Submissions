EVIDEN/Bull S.A.S answer


Eviden/Bull S.A.S. – Call for evidence for Chips Act 2.0 – November 2025 1


**Disclaimer**

The purpose of this document is to answer a public consultation initiated by
the European Commission related to the Chips Act 1.0, in order to prepare
the Chips Act 2.0 and with a focus on Advanced Chips.

With a 50 years legacy in making chips and systems, Eviden/Bull is not only
the biggest system integrator in EU, delivering the fastest HPC & AI Super
Computers in Europe, but is also a design house, engineering advanced
chips, notably for High Speed networking, but not only.

The following answer to the call for evidence, is focusing on advanced node
chips for the AI related markets, from the perspective of a System Integrator
and also a Chip design house which has direct access to these markets and
an interest in increasing EU sovereignty in that space.

# European Chips ACT

**Abstract**

The EU Chips Act Package (a.k.a. Chips Act 1.0) was an answer from EU to the
COVID 19 crisis on chips shortage and its impacts on Europe’s economy,
especially on the car ecosystem, and an evidence of an unacceptable
dependency on foreign companies or even geo-political wills.
In that respect, the Chips Act 1.0 Pillar 1 was focused on re-enforcing or
improving EU offering capabilities on the full chain, from design to back-end
to become sovereign as much as possible.
Its main market and the principal target was to reinforce the mature node
ecosystem (65 to 90nm and later 20-29nm), serving the industrial markets in
Europe, principally the car industry, for which European demand was really
existing.
In other words, increasing EU sovereignty through the Chips Act 1.0 by
enabling investments in the Mature Nodes manufacturing offering
ecosystem could have been impactful – ONLY because there was local
demand for locally engineered chips AND because there was a local demand
for them.
The net conclusion is that increasing the manufacturing offering
ecosystem, with the massive investments needed (in tens of Billions €) to
become sovereign is impossible if there is no local demand for EU born
technologies, especially for advanced node chips.

The advent of Generative AI, starting 2022, the current race to AGI, all the
geo-political battles on Chips, have completely obsoleted all existing
thinkings on what needs to be done, especially in advanced node chips, as
levels of investments in advanced node chips are skyrocketing and are
putting EU in a trailing position (in 2022 US was already investing 7X more in
micro chips than EU, and China 16X more than EU).
This completely new dynamic must trigger a completely new approach to
making EU sovereign, especially because if advanced node chips are
prevalent in Data Centers generative AI workloads, they are becoming the
de facto requirements to power the “Software Defined Cars” era (initiated by
Tesla and the Chinese car makers). It would partly putting at risk investments
made recently in EU on mature node offerings (65-90 and 20-29nm).

This document aims to explain why the EU Chips Act 2.0 should consider
focusing on developing the EU based demand for Advanced Node chips,
privileging European born/engineered technologies rather than focusing
first on developing the corresponding manufacturing ecosystem offering.

If the demand for advanced node chips comes from European design
houses, it will enable the current (mature node) European ecosystem to
invest in the corresponding technologies, i.e. the (local) demand is creating
the (local) offer, not the reverse.

**The 2022 findings leading to the Chips Act 1.0**
The Chips act 1.0 was introduced by the EU in February 2022 to respond to
the global supply chain disruptions seen during the COVID 19.

It’s important to note that while the disruptions seen during the COVID 19
have affected many of the industries relying on semi-conductors in Europe,
ranging from DataCenter, networking (Phones), robotics and the Car
industry, some of the production centers were in Europe but lacking raw
materials or even discrete, very cheap components coming from far east.
At the end of the day, stopping car production because of a missing 0.002$
component sourced in far east or because of a EU made mature node ASIC
has the same impact.

Net result was reflected in the European Chips Survey to prepare the Chip
[Act 1.0 (https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/89124),](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/89124)
which, with 141 answers, was the basis of the recommendations of the Chips
Act 1.0. In short the pooled responders, mostly suppliers or the EU industry,
directed their findings towards the increase of the semi-conductor back-end

ecosystem in EU, mainly for
(very) mature nodes
(65-280+nm).

Not surprisingly, the
responders, European
suppliers to the industry and
producing In Europe were
focused on increasing the
manufacturing offering of
their existing lines of
products, i.e. making more
mature node chips.

Thus, the Chips Act 1.0, without better or clearer targets, enabled the mature
node Chip ecosystem to increase their production or to increase their
productivity with post Covid 19 incentives.

In summary, the Chips Act 1.0 pilar 1 has had positive effects on the mature
node ecosystem and on the industries relying on the mature node semiconductors, generally speaking for EU sovereignty.
The focus made in the Chips Act 1.0 on developing the offering was probably
the good answer because and only because there was a strong demand for
locally engineered and manufactured microchips, notably by the
Bosch/NXP/Infineon chip manufacturers for the European Car industry.

In other words, if these companies hadn’t developed the corresponding IPs,
focusing the Chips Act on the offering (grow the manufacturing ecosystem
capacity) wouldn’t have had the same effect.

**The 2022 sudden AI rise market dynamics changed dramatically the**
**landscape. It must change the Chip Act 2.0 focus.**

As said above, back in 2022, the Chips Act 1.0 was not specifically targeting
the advanced microchips. In fact the surveys showed that most respondent
did not see any demand for advanced node microchips (=<7nm).
It’s probably hard to anticipate a wave like the AI wave, but it is also highly
likely that none of the respondents were in the Datacenter business as even
in 2022, most of the chips used in that market were already using or
targeting the advanced node chips, at least using nodes <17nm.

The generative Large Language AI Models advent and the chock produced
by OpenAI ChatGPT, the consequent in-interrupted rise of AI since, have
increased the race towards the more Advanced Node chips, bringing this
segment to ~22% (growing) of the foundry’s businesses in 2025, while the
mature nodes (the 28nm suite spot), where most of the market capacities
lies, represent ~25% (~45% if combined with up to 65nm).

In brief, at the same time as TSMC is shifting away from mature nodes
towards the most advanced nodes, the European ecosystem has
(over?)capacities in the mature node market, but has almost no ecosystem
for the Advanced Node Chips that are required for AI.

If we set apart the backend ecosystem on which most Advanced node chips
designers (Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, etc…) are relying on, i.e. TSMC, Samsung,
SMIC, Global Foundries, etc… the main difference between the mature
ecosystem and the advanced node ecosystem is the design houses and the
IP they generate. We have the design houses and the final customers in EU
for Mature Nodes, but we only have a few design houses (Eviden being one
of them), not the critical mass for Advanced Nodes, while a significant
market exists and fulfilled mostly by US companies.

As interim conclusions,

  - we could say that while there is demand (est. ~35B€ in 2025) for

advanced chips in EU, especially for AI, we don’t have yet the design
houses that could fulfill this demand from European companies.

  - Creating or increasing the backend OFFER for advanced node will

likely not help IF there is no EU company capable of competing with
US or Chinese Advanced Chips/AI accelerators as an example.

  - Recent history shows that it’s difficult for TSMC or Intel to justify a

50+B$ investment in more capacity in Europe if there’s no local
customers for it.

Hence, a Chip Act 2.0 strategy that would focus only on creating more
Advanced node back end offering is likely to again reinforce existing back
end providers, including foreign ones through joint ventures, while not
answering the main problem: who’s creating the advanced node chips final
products in Europe?

The following paragraph provides options to address this challenge.


Eviden/Bull S.A.S. – Call for evidence for Chips Act 2.0 – November 2025 5


**2026-2030: addressing the AI challenges and EU sovereignty.**


As expressed in previous paragraphs, the market landscape has dramatically
changed in the last years, from a microchips market in which EU was globally
quite well established, on the biggest segment in volume and revenue
(mature nodes), with local customers e.g. the car industry driving the
specifications, and a complete ecosystem responding to them, and even
exporting outside EU.

The advent of AI is not only hurting our capabilities to fulfil the DC space (we
lack most of them) but is also likely to hurt the European mature node
ecosystem because the Car industry is about/already changing it’s paradigm
from the platform based cars, to the Software Defined Cars, in which the
focus is set on EV, autonomous driving, and user experience, with AI
everywhere, requiring Advanced node chips, like in DC systems, drastically if
not totally removing mature nodes requirements in cars.

In this situation, not only Europe is lacking many capabilities for Data Center
AI, but all the mature node ecosystem will tomorrow lack advanced node
design capabilities, hard and soft IPs, back end and advanced packaging, i.e.
previous investments made through Chip Act 1.0, increasing the offering for
mature nodes will shortly be obsoleted.
As an example of this forced mutation, for SW defined cars, some German
car makers have been condemned to buy the HW and SW platform from US
makers, such as Qualcomm, removing part of the market of EU mature
nodes firms.

What should we do from now?


1. **Increase the demand for EU-born technologies, especially when**

**public money is at stake** . As demonstrated previously, the demand
for Advanced Node chips is already high in Europe, and is going to
continue growing at a faster pace than any other segment due to AI
requirements, and is almost totally fulfilled by US or far East
companies.
While it is impossible to replace for the moment companies like Nvidia
in this market, EU should put in place a legislation that promotes,
incentivize or enforce the use of EU born technologies (by companies
headquartered in EU) for each and every € invested with public
money.
When public money is used in Public-Private Partnerships, the
investment made into EU-born technologies should correspond at
least prorate to the public money invested into the PPP.

The intent here is to incent startups and existing companies in this
space to invest in cutting edge technologies knowing there will be a
ROI, and helping them grow to a critical mass.


Eviden/Bull S.A.S. – Call for evidence for Chips Act 2.0 – November 2025 6


**2.** **Increase dramatically the investment made in the ecosystem and**

**focus on high TRL and Fabless products.**

As stated earlier, EU is lagging behind US, China and other Asian
countries.


**In 2022,**
**US was**
**forecasted to**
**spend almost 7X**
**EU Capex in**
**semiconductors,**
**ASIA/China 16X**
**EU Capex**
**expenditure, and**
**has probably**
**increased since.**

While the level of investments needed for advanced node chips is
increasing exponentially, the EU, the member states and the
ecosystem of companies in that space will need to choose where the
investment capacities need to go first and where they have the better
leverage for the future.

Our thinking, a first argument, is that the best leverage for the future
is to invest in Intellectual Property differentiation with high TRL,
mainly because higher IP differentiation = better margin = better
research loop = more wealth creation and sovereignty for EU.
The second argument is that enabling the creation of Advanced node
chips for AI or related workloads, will trigger the transformation from
mature node to advanced node of the existing European companies.
Growing IP is the never ending story of this industry.
Chips Act 2.0 could notably turn Europe’s hardware IP fragmentation
into an unmatched advantage, by fostering the development, piloting
industrialization of a standardized, adaptative chiplet platform and
marketplaces. This can be achieved by gathering the EU world-class
RTOs (CEA, IMEC, Fraunhoffer) with innovative chips startups and an
industrialization arm such as Eviden, around a collaborative multi-year
research, development and industrialization project.

In summary, Chips Act 2.0 should incentivize massively the creation
of high TRL products, mainly targeted at fabless design houses &
startups, because it has the potential to leverage/or trigger the rapid
transition of the existing (mature node) ecosystem.
In comparison, the investment needed to create an advanced node
fab in Europe, with not enough local market to be sustainable will not
have the same impact on all the European Chips Ecosystem.

Concerning the size of the investment needed to enter this market
and to stay in it, the Nvidia example is self-explanatory:
130.5B$ of revenue in 2025 (FY closing in June 25), 75% gross margin,
an operating net income of 62% (81.4B$), 42B$ of available cash, and
finally, Nvidia invested 13B$ (10%) in R&D.
A single company (yet the market leader) has invested 13B$ alone in
high TRL products, in one year.

With Chips Act 2.0, the EU commission should set the ambition to the
level that meets the unprecedented challenge that the AI revolution
poses to the world, to Europe and its 450M citizens economy, finally
our potential downgrading in the worldwide economy.

EU should take a more active stake of a larger investment, directed
towards EU born/headquartered companies or organizations with
high TRL – in line with the Draghi report recommendations – which
would translate into a direct contribution of 40B€ to 50B€ of new
money provided through the Chip Act 2.0, for the period 2026-2029,
representing 30% of fundings leveraged (plus 30% from member
states and 40% from private investments) representing potentially 130
to 160B€ investment in 3 years.

Funding should be available to projects supported by European
companies. Eligibility criteria could be inspired by the rules enforced
in the framework of instruments such as the European Defence Fund
(EDF) and the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP).
In summary:

   - Public money should be invested first in technologies that have

direct impacts on citizen wealth, employment, security and
living standards, in extenso, EU or member state money shall be
used to grow the EU based Chips ecosystem, prorate to public
money share when investing for instance in advanced AI
systems (e.g. AI & Giga factories).
Act for a “Buy European” change of directions, in line with the
Draghi report recommendations.

   - Because the Advanced Node challenge, triggered by AI is

exponentially increasing the investment required to keep up in
this race, the EU should lead and increase its own investment,
through the Chips Act 2.0, to a minimum of 50B€.

   - Last, it is highly envisioned that the European startup/ScaleUp

ecosystem, who currently has difficulties to raise funding
through the private VC channels, will be able to leverage largely
a “Buy European” initiative in which public money is serving EUborn products.
This would be an extremely important booster over the current
situation in which a CY2025 +20B$ market for GPUs in Europe, is
partly paid by EU/Member state public money, going directly to
US GPU or cloud market leaders.

**Summary**


1. Eviden, as an integrator of advanced super computers for AI and High

Performance Computing, but also as an Advanced Node design house
(notably for BXI network interconnect), is willing to act as a strong
actor in this ecosystem, in France, in Europe, with Germany as a close
partner, for our common sovereignty.

2. With the AI industrial revolution, the EU and the commission, have a

strong drive and responsibility in enabling the conditions for European
companies and member states, not only to keep up the extremely fast
market dynamics coming from USA and far Asia, but to leapfrog it, by
aggregating the fantastic European research and growing
startup/companies ecosystems onto a common goal.

3. Because there is no company who can afford developing a product

without a market, and because the advanced node spendings in
Europe are going to products and services in USA and Asia, the main
focus of the Chips Act 2.0 should shift from increasing the
manufacturing offering ecosystem to enabling first the fabless high
TRL or final products companies & startups doing Advanced Node
designs. If they have access to a market in Europe for their products,
they will in turn drag behind them the rise of a local Advanced node
ecosystem (potentially raised from the Mature Node existing
ecosystem). In other words, a local market demand, fulfilled by local
fabless design houses will enable the underlying ecosystem, from
manufacturing to raw materials and equipment suppliers. Not the
reverse.


4. Finally, the EU commission, for the Chips Act 2.0, should put in place a

legal framework that enables the direct and mandatory use of public
money on EU born technologies when available, a “EU Technology
first” regulation, enabling the demand for Advanced Node Chips for
European Companies. Moreover, a direct and larger (50B€)
investment of new money coming from EU, representing 30% of the
total leveraged investment, is needed to stay as much as possible on
par with the new AI industrial revolution, to face the potential
downgrading of Europe.
