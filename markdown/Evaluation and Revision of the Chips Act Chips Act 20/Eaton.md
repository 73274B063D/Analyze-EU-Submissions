feedback: Eaton welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the European Commissions
  review of the European Chips Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/1781). We recognise the strategic
  importance of strengthening Europes semiconductor ecosystem and fully support the
  objectives of resilience, competitiveness, and technological sovereignty outlined
  in the Act. We endorse the key messages and recommendations from the Irish Department
  of Enterprise, Tourism and Employments stakeholder briefing, particularly 1) the
  need for broad stakeholder engagement in shaping the future of the European semiconductor
  sector, 2) the importance of ensuring Irelands interests and opportunities are reflected
  in the revised Chips Act, and 3) the value of collaborative feedback to inform a
  robust national position. We support the Acts focus on reducing dependency on non-EU
  sources for leading-edge chips and increasing transparency and resilience across
  supply chains. Eatons technologies, especially in energy optimisation and efficiency,
  align with the EUs goals for green and sustainable innovation We advocate for continued
  and expanded funding for collaborative research projects, enabling industry, academia,
  and SMEs to co-develop innovative semiconductor solutions. Eaton is actively engaged
  in collaborative initiatives and welcomes opportunities to participate in EU-funded
  projects Eaton is committed to supporting the European Chips Acts objectives and
  to working collaboratively with Irish and European stakeholders. We believe that
  a resilient, innovative, and sustainable semiconductor ecosystem is essential for
  Europes technological future. We appreciate the opportunity to contribute and look
  forward to ongoing engagement as the revision process advances.
