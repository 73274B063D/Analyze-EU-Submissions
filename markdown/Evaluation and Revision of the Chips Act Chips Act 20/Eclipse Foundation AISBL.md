# Eclipse Foundation Feedback for revision of the Chips Act


Open hardware (specifications, designs, and code) is a foundation of semiconductor

knowledge that is guaranteed to be available for any purpose. It can be used as-is for

fabricating chips in the EU. It can also be modified to match the various semiconductor

needs of the EU, or to optimise production based on the raw materials available or other

constraints. The EU is already using open hardware in some situations to increase resilience,

foster innovation, and provide multiple economic benefits, but there are many more

opportunities that are not yet being used.


We thank the European Commission for this opportunity to participate in the revision of the

Chips Act. Below are our recommendations for how to achieve the Act's goals.

## RISC-V


RISC-V is an example of an open hardware ecosystem which is already providing benefits

and also clearly has further potential to foster innovation and to grow production capacity

and businesses in Europe. Many of the leading researchers on RISC-V are in Europe.


We recommend looking to RISC-V for ideas on how the European Union can form an

ecosystem of communities and businesses.

## Valuing resilience, security and sovereignty


Chips made from open hardware can contribute to European objectives of resilient supply

chains, increased security, and digital sovereignty. But, Europe needs to greatly increase

production and that will require investment, which in turn requires customers and demand. If

purchasers in Europe take a short-term view and only look at price and technical

characteristics, Europe will continue to finance the chip production of other countries and

create more dependencies in its supply chains.

Open hardware is an opportunity for Europe to build capacity and expertise and secure its

strategic needs in the increasingly important semiconductor market. The EU, as a political

entity, has a long-term view and values resilience, security, and sovereignty. EU legislation

should look for opportunities to ensure that the full value of open hardware is taken into

account during public procurement, and should consider if there are situations where

cybersecurity, or other values, requires open hardware. And more broadly, to lead this work

toward becoming a self-financing market, investments should be made when opportunities

are spotted to remove anything that is blocking the growth of the supply or the demand.


With chips getting more specialised, and products and services becoming increasingly

dependent on the availability of specific chips, the issue of chip availability is more

important than ever for supply chains. This trend is likely to continue. If digital sovereignty is

not given sufficient priority today, it may be more complicated in the future.

## Detailed study of Europe's semiconductor needs


The EU needs a detailed analysis with two focuses. The first should be on what chips are

needed by Europe, to guarantee the functioning of not only Europe’s IT systems but also all

the industries which rely on availability of chips as components of what they produce. This

data could be used to stimulate supply by giving clarity on what types of chips are in

demand in Europe. The EU could also use this to identify which situations have greater

impact on resilience, security and sovereignty.


The second focus should be on the designs and specifications that Europe needs for the

local production of what is needed. This data could be used to check whether open

hardware exists for Europe’s various needs. When a need is not currently covered by open

hardware, this may be an opportunity for an EU project to create something of value (e.g.

interfaces such as PCIe, Ethernet, and PHYs). Where open hardware exists but is not being

used, there should be a check to see if there is sufficient awareness and readiness.

## A review of funding


There is a perception that EU funding mechanisms in this domain are not efficient enough.

First, a lot of EU funding might be going to international companies (or their European

branches) who have many goals other than what is in the European Chips Act. Second, a lot

of EU funding, regardless of which companies it is granted to, might subsequently be used

to make purchases from non-EU companies.


This is a perception, but if it's correct there would indeed be a failure which would need to

be addressed. It would be useful to review the end points of current EU funding in this

domain. Consideration should be given to funding strategies which would direct funding

towards open technologies which will be forever available for use in the EU, and to local

research and fabrication capacity with a strategy to ensure the funding supports open

technologies.

## Fostering an ecosystem


In our discussions with stakeholders, we heard many comments about the costs of

collaboration in the EU and a lack of opportunities to form networks. If the Chips Act could

help to fill this gap, it would benefit students, start-ups and SMEs, and could also provide a

venue where larger companies and investors could meet these other categories. This could

be done in many ways, including digital innovation hubs, local networks, online knowledge

sharing portals, and online meetings and events.

## European Starting points


There are already European projects making significant progress. Projects such as Tristan or

Rebecca have been trail blazers and encouraged many, from SMEs to established

companies, to take a more detailed look into RISC-V and the related semiconductor

ecosystem. What is still missing is deeper exchange and more partnerships between SMEs

and big players that share Europe’s goals. Open hardware should be the basis for a

significant ramping up of chip production that aligns with the EU’s short- and long-term

goals. Europe already has a lot of expertise in RISC-V and Europeans are established in the

RISC-V ecosystem. This should be supported and used as the basis for a robust

semiconductors strategy for the EU.

Eclipse Foundation has over 20 years of experience in building project ecosystems. For

open hardware and especially for RISC-V we have several European initiatives such as the

PULP Platform by ETH Zurich in academia or the OpenHW Foundation (part of the Eclipse

Foundation) that hosts collaboration on production ready RISC-V Cores. Having a vendor
neutral, open hardware platform provider which provides a place to develop common

building blocks collaboratively would be the easiest and fastest way to improve our access

to important hardware designs and know-how. With the huge European user and contributor

base of CVA6 (an application-ready RISC-V core, capable of running Linux), or the CVE4

family (which run inside a microcontroller unit), we have already created value that is in

constant use by large companies and SMEs.


To build on these existing projects and to foster a business ecosystem in Europe, it would be

useful to find ways which encourage more use in commercial products. There may also be

benefits to convening European semiconductor companies for discussion on this topic so

that experts can demonstrate the quality level of the existing building blocks and discuss

questions which companies may have.

## Conclusion


We remain at your disposal for further discussion or to provide implementation details for

any of the above and we look forward to working with you in the elaboration of this

legislative text.
