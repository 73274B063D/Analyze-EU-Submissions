feedback: 'As a teacher and researcher who designs and submits chips for fabrication,
  I see a significant gap that could be addressed by Chips Act 2: as far as I am aware,
  there are currently no European programs that fund chip fabrication for universities.
  All of the chips I submit must be financed through individual research project budgets,
  which means that only designs from PhD students or research engineers are ever manufactured
  never those from bachelors or masters students. When I was a graduate student, I
  had the opportunity to fabricate a 180 nm chip through the MOSIS Education Program.
  As a microelectronics student, being able not only to simulate but also to fabricate
  and test my own design made a big difference. It was highly motivating and enriched
  the learning experience. I am referring to initiatives using standard industry CAD
  tools, as our goal is to train engineers who are ready for the semiconductor industry.
  I believe the European Chips Act could meaningfully improve in this area. If a similar
  educational fabrication program already exists in Europe, I would be very interested
  to learn about it; otherwise, I see this as an important opportunity to strengthen
  microelectronics education and training. Additionally, open calls for funding to
  support summer schools and related educational initiatives would be highly valuable
  and greatly appreciated. EUROPRACTICE is highly valued by our community, especially
  for its mini@sic initiatives. The trainings it provides are consistently high-quality
  and remain accessible and affordable.'
