feedback: Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBAs)
  are crucial within the electronics ecosystem but with an underrated and not-so-visible
  role for the general public. Both of them are of dramatic interest and must be part
  of the Chips Act 2.0 as well as their contributors such as suppliers of materials,
  specific consumables and others. For example, delivery of high reliable sub-systems
  and systems to the defense and aero-space domains implies a strong and full ecosystem
  for a sovereign Europe and PCBs are a pillar of this ecosystem. Including both PCBs
  and PCBAs into a Chips Act 2.0 appears as a pre-request for a more independent and
  a stronger European system acting now and for the future.
