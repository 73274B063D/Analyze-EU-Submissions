# EU chip act versus a true EU electronics act


**Dear European policymakers and officials,**


Allow me to offer my contribution to strengthening Europe’s resilience in electronics. The
views below are my own, but they are grounded in experience and in plain common sense. I
also start from the assumption that everyone involved is acting in good faith and genuinely
wants the best for the European project.


Over the past two years I have spent considerable time thinking, discussing and writing about
this topic. To avoid needless repetition, I refer to some of my earlier work where relevant.

## What went wrong with the chips act 1.0?


In truth, we have achieved very little in ten years. In fact, across all areas of electronics, we
continue to lose global market share. The first thing we must do, in my view, is define clear
objectives that reflect the real needs of our society.


This also requires everyone to stay within their domain. It is like preparing a fine dinner with
your partner on a Saturday evening: if you both grab the same pan by the same handle,
nothing good will come of it. You will end up ordering Chinese takeaway or McDonald’s.
Coordination works only when each person knows their role.


Over recent decades this has not been our strength. Take, for example, the ambition to
achieve mobility without fossil fuels and without CO₂ emissions, a noble goal for engineers to
work on. But too often legislators have taken it one step too far by prescribing that this
challenge must be solved exclusively with electric motors. If engineers were to invent a
combustion engine powered by a cheap, non-fossil, environmentally neutral fuel, emitting
neither CO₂ nor harmful substances, that solution would be lost to us because policymakers
overstepped into the engineers’ domain.


We made the same mistake with the Chips Act 1.0.

## What must be done instead?
### Define clear goals of societal importance


Europe needs reliable electronics for defence, space and avionics, infrastructure, medical
applications, data centres, everything our society fundamentally depends on. What “reliable
electronics” should mean is not a political question. It is a question for Europe’s industrial
and engineering community.


An engineer does not need to be told that a chip cannot function alone and that a full value
chain is required to produce robust electronics. Nor does an engineer need to be instructed
which chips must be developed to meet the goals listed above. They already know.


### Policymakers must make entrepreneurship possible, simple and fair

Entrepreneurs are not asking for endless subsidies. They want a clear, broad framework
within which they can operate. I have written about this in What Needs to Happen?


Businesses also need administrative simplicity. Governments may demand information and
transparency, but they must first think about how this can be achieved in a simple way. I
proposed one idea in Creation of an EU Electronics Raw Materials Database.


A fair and level playing field is something every entrepreneur expects. It is self-evident that
this is essential, and I wrote about it in Why Make Things Complicated When Simplicity
_Works?_


A predictable and meaningful market outlook is the key motivator that drives entrepreneurs to
invest. This, too, is something policymakers can influence. I explained this in Retain Public
Funds within the EU Economy.

### What can policymakers no longer a;ord?


**naivety**


Europe’s unrestrained pursuit of globalisation over the past 30 years has gone too far. If there
is one thing that truly distinguishes the EU from the two major global players, China and the
United States, it is our naïvety. It makes us likeable, but also extremely weak. Both China and
the US have taken full advantage of this.


In electronics this is painfully clear. We must face the fact that even the electronics for
defence we produce in Europe is not free from Chinese PCBs. The consequences for your
application can be serious, as demonstrated by the recent cases of compromised solar
inverters, drones in Norway, electric buses in Norway, and many other examples. I wrote
extensively about this earlier in Smart, Cunning and Extremely Dangerous based on the The
study _“Analysis of Hardware Manipulations in Distributed Manufacturing Processes”_,
conducted by IPH GmbH on behalf of Germany’s “ _Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der_
_Informationstechnik (BSI)”._


I also fully support the position submitted by IPC: _POSITION PAPER — Review EU Chips Act:_
_Europe Needs a Chips Act Plus_ . Personally, I would state the case even more firmly. Unless
we draw a clear line in the sand, Europe’s electronics industry will have little meaningful
future left in five years.


With the greatest respect for your work, even if it does not always bear fruit, we are
determined to give this a real second chance.

# The Electronics Market in Europe in 2025 Dirk Stans


# INTRODUCTION

Europe’s electronics industry stands at a critical crossroads. As global competition intensifies
and international players strengthen their positions through coordinated industrial strategies,
Europe must re-evaluate its role in the technological value chain. This document brings
together a series of practical, experience-driven proposals aimed at restoring the
competitiveness, resilience, and strategic independence of the European electronics sector.


At the heart of the analysis is a clear call to action **:** Europe must stop being reactive and start
shaping its own industrial destiny **.** The EU Chips Act is a promising starting point, but it
remains insu\icient unless the entire electronics value chain, from raw materials and chip
production to PCB assembly and final integration, is supported holistically. Without this
complete ecosystem, Europe's ambitions risk being reduced to isolated achievements with
limited systemic impact.


Drawing on over three decades of entrepreneurial experience and active leadership within
European industry federations, I have identified key structural challenges and proposed
realistic solutions requiring minimal budgetary investment but promising maximum returns.
These are not abstract policy ambitions; they are concrete, executable ideas **,** tested against
the everyday realities of doing business in Europe.

## Why this document matters


The proposals here address five core areas where strategic action is urgently needed:



1. **Fair trade enforcement**



Europe must reintroduce fairness and enforceability into its trade systems. Companies
wishing to sell into the EU must establish a legal presence here and comply with the
same standards as EU-based firms. This is not protectionism, it is common sense,
aimed at ensuring transparency and accountability.

2. **Retention of public funds within the EU economy**

European tax money, especially under large subsidy schemes like the EU Chips Act
and Draghi Plan, must benefit European stakeholders. The principle of “EU Origin First”
should be formalised into law to ensure a minimum threshold of EU-added value in
publicly funded projects.

3. **Creation of an EU electronics raw materials database**



In response to increasing regulatory burdens stemming from the Green Deal, this
centralised database would eliminate redundant reporting by requiring manufacturers
to register materials once, thus saving the industry billions in unnecessary
administrative costs.

4. **Simplification and harmonisation of industrial standards**



Europe’s regulatory landscape is overly complex, particularly for SMEs. Streamlining
overlapping standards would reduce compliance costs and level the playing field
across the continent, without compromising quality or safety.


5. **Reframing the narrative on value and competitiveness**

Cheap imports from outside the EU often mask deeper risks, data harvesting,
intellectual property loss, and long-term technological dependence. It is time to
challenge the logic that price alone defines value. Europe must reclaim its belief in
ethical production, technical excellence, and local accountability.

## A European electronics strategy rooted in pragmatism


These proposals do not seek more funding, nor do they rely on visionary but vague blueprints.
Instead, they o\er practical next steps, measures that are technically feasible, cost-e\ective,
and politically realistic. The goal is simple: restore Europe's ability to design, produce, and
scale world-class electronics within its own borders.


Europe has the talent, the infrastructure, and the industrial legacy to thrive. What’s missing is
decisive action and the political courage to simplify where possible and protect what matters.
Whether it is a matter of fair trade, industrial investment, or educational integrity, we must
recognise that the time for gentle warnings has passed. The urgency is real. The risks of
inaction are immense.


Let us move forward with a renewed focus on practical sovereignty in technology, a
sovereignty built not through slogans or subsidies alone, but through thoughtful, decisive
action that places Europe back in control of its own future.

Of course, if anyone has an even better solution, I wholeheartedly welcome it. After all,
practical willingness paired with a moderately good idea beats endless criticism paired with
no alternatives every time.

With motivated regards,

# Tomorrow's challenges for the European Electronics market

_24 April 2024_
## The situation today.

In 2020, economists predicted an annual growth rate of 7 percent for the European
electronics production market until 2030, highlighting the sector's essential role in economic
expansion. In 2022, European Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) production amounted
to approximately 154 billion euros. Of this, nearly 52 billion euros were generated by 2,200
Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies, and around 81 billion euros by Original
Equipment Manufacturers (OEM).

For this European PCBA production, we require about 9.25 billion euros worth of Printed
Circuit Boards (PCB). The remaining 170 European PCB producers manufacture only 1.76
billion euros worth, indicating that we are more than 80 percent dependent on PCB imports.

Since 2020, the European Parliament and the European Commission have been working on
the European Chips Act. Their objectives include strengthening EU leadership in research and
technology, building and enhancing EU capacity to innovate in designing, producing, and
packaging advanced, energy-efficient, and secure chips, establishing an adequate framework
to significantly increase EU production capacity by 2030, addressing the acute skills
shortage, attracting new talent, supporting the emergence of skilled labor, and developing a
comprehensive understanding of global semiconductor supply chains and taking appropriate
measures where necessary.

Specifically, this means scaling up chip production from approximately 10 percent of the
world's production volume in 2020 to about 20 percent by 2030. During this period, the
market will grow by 97 percent. Therefore, the volume of European chip production in 2030
will need to be nearly four times that of 2020, presenting a significant challenge. Additionally,
a chip requires the entire electronics value chain to function.

In addition to these challenges, new regulations such as the European Circular Economy
(Green Deal) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) are imminent. Developers will need
to create designs that are repairable and recyclable, while companies will need to submit
CSR reports and provide products and services with CO2 impact indicators.
## What is needed to address these challenges?

Governments must emphasise the importance of the industry, not only to the general public
but also to academic institutions. EU industries should regain priority in the allocation of
public funds or government-subsidised funds. We could establish EU databases for
components and raw materials and mandate their use by manufacturers, leading to
harmonisation and availability of crucial data. A European Electronic Computer-Aided Design
(E-CAD) package for PCB and PCBA would be the final piece in this puzzle.

Promoting technical studies, offering training programs, and involving the industry more
closely in education are crucial. Financial support for educational institutions offering
electronics programs is essential.


Creating a level playing field for our industry is also important. This can be achieved by
abolishing import tariffs on necessary raw materials and investing in a local raw materials
industry. Examining import tariffs for finished products, monitoring the market, and
encouraging financial institutions to make capital available are also crucial. Promoting and
mandating EU origin of products and services in purchases with public funds. Keeping energy
affordable and readily available. Implementing a streamlined and digital government
administration. Additionally, smart investments should focus on education, electronic
component and application development, the development of an E-CAD package and EU
databases, chip production and packaging, chiplet production, PCB production, and PCB
Assembly.
## Conclusion

Europe must work hard to strengthen the electronics industry, not only out of strategic
necessity but also as an economic and social priority. Creating a resilient and sustainable
electronics market will not only contribute to economic growth but also maintain a leading
position on the global stage.

# EUROPEAN SILICON TO SYSTEMS ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING STRATEGY

_13 June 2024_

All those I am addressing with this message are active participants in the European
electronics industry. It is therefore relevant to all of us, considering the subject I intend to
discuss with you. Recently, I wrote the previous article above.

Today, I wish to expand on this topic with two very important and compelling documents that
were published this week. Over the past year, I have collaborated intensively on these
documents and have given them my full support.

Since the initial meeting, held on 19th April 2023 and organised by IPC Europe in Brussels, a
working group has been formed. This group consists of individuals from European companies
within the electronics sector, collaborating to develop a well-founded report for the European
Commission. Our goal is to convince them of the significance of our industry — its scale, its
strategic indispensability, the pressures it faces, and the necessity of considering the entire
value chain to achieve the desired outcomes of the European Chip Act.

As you might expect, this is a long-term endeavour. It needs to be supported by reliable data
and include a thorough analysis that not only addresses the concerns and perspectives of the
Commission but also reflects what we as an industry deem important.

Throughout the year, several papers have already been presented, including a SWOT analysis
and data illustrating the scope and current state of our industry.

  - [This week, we have released a broadly aligned call to action.](https://emails.ipc.org/links/CalltoActionElectronicsManufacturing.pdf)

  - [And a comprehensive report detailing what must be done to ensure the long-term](https://emails.ipc.org/links/IPC-Securing-Europe-Electronics-Ecosystem.pdf)

[relevance of our industry.](https://emails.ipc.org/links/IPC-Securing-Europe-Electronics-Ecosystem.pdf)

This entire analysis is based on our knowledge from 2023. The critical issues have been
identified, the remedies defined, and now it is time to begin the treatment. Therefore, I seek
your support in endorsing, disseminating, and advocating these reports to all those who can
influence policy. Public endorsement can be shown by contacting Alison James from IPC
[(AlisonJames@ipc.org) and sharing your logo. She will then include your company or](mailto:AlisonJames@ipc.org)
organisation in the list of supportive entities, which will be visible at the end of the call-toaction document.

Today, in mid-2024, with new experiences and a world that looks di\erent from 14 months
ago, our work is far from complete. We have new urgent and pertinent topics that the working
group will address. Thus, although the previous reports are significant and represent an
important initial step towards recovery, they are not the only actions required. We will
continue our e\orts but now depend on your support for the published documents.

Thank you in advance for your commitment to preserving and strengthening our indispensable
electronics industry.

**Dirk Stans**

# What Needs to Happen?

_19 February 2025_


The EU Chips Act was introduced in several phases to the wider public from 2021 onwards
and, following approval by the European Parliament and the Council, the regulation came
into force on 21 September 2023.


To recap, the Chips Act will be supported with over €43 billion in policy-driven investments
until 2030, complemented by a similar amount of private long-term investments.


The Chips Act aims to:


  - Invest in next-generation technologies

  - Ensure access across Europe to design tools and pilot lines for the prototyping,
testing, and experimentation of advanced chips

  - Establish certification procedures for energy-e\icient and reliable chips to guarantee
quality and security for critical applications

  - Create a more investment-friendly framework for setting up production facilities in
Europe

  - Support innovative start-ups, scale-ups, and SMEs in accessing equity financing

  - Promote skills, talent, and innovation in microelectronics

  - Develop mechanisms to anticipate and respond to shortages and crises in the
semiconductor sector, ensuring supply security

  - Establish international partnerships on semiconductors with like-minded countries


By 2030, these efforts should lead to a European market share of 20% in global chip
production.

## Key Questions from the Electronics Sector


Following the introduction of the Act, industry players immediately raised fundamental
questions:


  - Which chips will we manufacture, and for what purpose?

  - What happens to the entire electronics production value chain? Will we only produce
chips while outsourcing the rest of the value chain?


These concerns prompted European industrial leaders to join forces, and under the initiative
of IPC Europe, an initial meeting took place on 19 April 2023 to discuss the necessary actions.
The market was mapped out, and projections were made up to 2030 and even 2035.

## Key Findings


From these discussions, the following conclusions emerged:


  - The Chips Act is meaningless without considering the entire value chain since a
functioning electronic application requires the full ecosystem.


  - Critical parts of this value chain are missing or barely present in Europe, preventing full
independence in delivering functioning applications.

  - The entire political spectrum must be made aware of the precarious situation of the
European electronics industry.


Many of my colleagues and I have written extensively about these concerns. Here are a few
examples:


  - [Tomorrow's Challenges for the European Electronics Market](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tomorrows-challenges-european-electronics-market-dirk-stans-dq8me/)

  - [Avoiding an Electronics Ice Age in Europe](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/european-silicon-systems-electronics-manufacturing-strategy-stans-1tahe/)


After two years of persistent efforts to raise awareness, we now find ourselves in a crucial
[period where reports by Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi emphasise the vital role of industry in](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf)
Europe and outline the necessary steps for industrial progress. The time has come to move
beyond raising awareness and to propose practical, actionable measures that require
minimal budgetary impact yet yield significant positive outcomes.

## What Can Governments, Member States, and the EU Do to Improve Europe's Competitiveness?


As a business leader and chairman of the FHI Federation of Technology Branches, I work
closely with technology and industrial companies that play a vital role in our primary
economy. These companies generate primary added value, the foundation of our prosperity.
However, the technological and manufacturing industries face enormous pressure due to a
wide range of challenges. So, what must be done?

### Priorities for a Stronger Industry


  - **Enhancing the Industry’s Image** : We must reposition the technology and
manufacturing sectors as attractive and indispensable pillars of society.

  - **Investing in Talent** : The industry needs a forward-looking strategy to educate and
attract the workforce of tomorrow.

  - **Creating a Level Playing Field** : Our industry must be able to compete fairly, both
within and outside the EU.

  - **Targeted Investments** : Smart and strategic investments are essential to drive
innovation and growth.

### The Role of Government: Supporting Entrepreneurship and Reducing Bureaucracy


To compete, businesses must first be able to operate efficiently. Entrepreneurship requires a
supportive framework, which the government can facilitate by making regulations simpler,
more effective, and less bureaucratic.


### Key Government Actions:

_Reducing Bureaucracy and Increasing ERiciency_


  - **Deregulation and Digitalisation** : Simplify administrative processes and implement
digital solutions to reduce the burden on businesses.

  - **Stop Complex Implementation of EU Rules** : Local governments must apply EU
regulations directly and without unnecessary complications.

  - **AJordable Energy** : Ensure stable and cost-e\ective energy supply, which is crucial for
competitive manufacturing.

  - **Accessible Industrial Space** : Encourage a\ordable business premises and
reasonable permitting rules that foster entrepreneurship.


_Addressing Competition within and Outside the EU_


**Within the EU:**


  - Maintain free movement of trade and capital, avoiding internal trade barriers.

  - Use influence in the European Council and Parliament to eliminate trade obstacles.


**Outside the EU:**


  - Ensure a level playing field. Companies exporting to the EU must adhere to the same
standards as European businesses.

  - Strengthen the role of customs and border enforcement to ensure compliance.

  - Respond swiftly and decisively to unfair competition caused by foreign state subsidies
or unethical working conditions by imposing import tari\s or granting tax benefits to
local businesses.

## European Measures for a Strong Future


To advance quickly, as today's world compels us to act decisively, we must start by
implementing quick wins, measures that are low-cost, relatively easy to introduce, and yield
maximum results. Here are three priority actions:



1. **Retain Public Funds within the EU Economy** : For public funded projects, at least



60% of the added value must remain within the EU. In other words, the known principle
of European Origin First.
2. **Centralised Digital Databases** : Establish EU-wide platforms for transparency in raw



materials and essential resources.
3. **Standardisation** : Simplify and harmonise industrial standards and regulations to



enhance competitiveness.
4. **Transparency** : If you want to trade in the EU, be established in the EU, and play by the

same rules. It’s not about protectionism, but about fairness, transparency, and
enforceability.



Each of these measures is detailed in individual reports to clarify their objectives and
implementation.


By implementing these targeted actions, European authorities can not only strengthen the
competitiveness of European businesses but also contribute to an innovative and
sustainable industrial sector.


Take this for what it is worth, but in my view, the time for action has long since arrived.
Endless discussions without decisions are no longer an option.


With motivated regards,


**Dirk Stans**

#EUChipsAct #ElectronicsIndustry #EuropeFirst #TechPolicy

### COMMENT


After years of raising awareness among key stakeholders in industry and politics, we can safely
assume everyone is now sufficiently informed about Europe's situation. Or, put another way, those
still unaware have had their heads buried where the sun does not shine.


It is time to change our approach. Colleagues, we must stop repeating ourselves and instead
define concrete proposals that policymakers can act upon to drive real change.


We must view both local and European politicians as partners in solving these challenges. Industry
holds the knowledge; they have the power to implement change. We must translate this knowledge
into practical proposals they can act on.


My proposals are just a starting point, and I hope many more follow, always pragmatic, aiming for
maximum impact with minimal effort.


I expect politicians to step up as true partners, ready to take action to strengthen Europe's
industrial position. In the short term, this should mean European regulations that are half as
complex and twice as effective.


Europe has not faced such pressing challenges in a long time. The time to act is now.


# Retain Public Funds within the EU Economy

_19 February 2025_


I propose formalising the "EU Origin First" principle into a binding directive, ensuring that
public funds consistently circulate within the EU economy. For years, the European
Commission has led by example, prioritising products and services with at least 60% EUadded value when allocating public resources. This approach helps ensure that EU funds,
particularly those partially derived from public subsidies, remain within our economy.
However, to maximise its effectiveness, this principle must transition from a
recommendation to a legally binding directive, requiring all member states to integrate it into
their national legislation.


Moreover, this must happen now, before deploying the €43 billion allocated to the Chips Act
and the €800 billion foreseen in the Draghi Report. Establishing a clear framework will provide
the certainty our industry needs to invest confidently in Europe’s technological future.

## Goals and Rationale


The core objective of this directive is to ensure that EU tax money and public funds remain
within the EU, directly reinforcing economic growth and strengthening European industries.
Retaining these funds within the EU contributes significantly to the economy, particularly in
critical sectors such as electronics. This is increasingly urgent as several key industries face
external threats, often from foreign players receiving substantial state subsidies to
undermine European businesses.


This challenge is particularly evident in the electronics sector. Today, many European
electronics engineering graduates complete their studies without ever working with a
European-made PCB, often unaware that such manufacturing even exists within the EU. The
same applies to assembled PCBs, fostering a generation of professionals who wrongly
assume that electronics production is an exclusively non-EU domain.


For the past two decades, this misconception has extended beyond individuals to SMEs,
gradually eroding Europe’s internal market. This runs counter to the spirit of the Green Deal,
as it is neither sustainable nor economically viable to manufacture PCBs outside the EU and
ship them 10,000 km at dubious prices. These imports often fail to meet EU environmental,
labour, and ethical standards.


By formalising the "EU Origin First" principle, we can put an end to this damaging trend while
fostering fair competition for European manufacturers. This will also benefit educational
institutions, enabling students to work with EU-made components, strengthening awareness
and confidence in Europe’s industrial capabilities. This, in turn, will support the development
of a stronger internal market and equip the next generation of European professionals with
direct exposure to high-quality European products.

### A Concrete Example: The Intel Chip Factory in Germany


A striking case study is the planned Intel chip factory in Brandenburg, Germany, which is set
to receive €8 billion in subsidies. If the EU Origin First principle were already in force,


European machine builders could compete for these investments. However, under current
rules, nearly all funds—except for building infrastructure and a few ASML machines—will flow
to Intel’s non-EU suppliers.


While this proposal may come too late for this specific project, its adoption would empower
European companies to compete for similar opportunities in the future, strengthening
confidence and encouraging further industrial investment.

## Feasibility and Implementation


This proposal is straightforward and cost-effective, requiring only political will and
determination.


Until recently, the political climate may not have been favourable to such an initiative.
However, global events have reshaped perspectives, making this the right time to act. Some
may argue that WTO agreements could pose barriers, but it is unrealistic to suggest that the
WTO dictates how member states spend their own tax revenue. Moreover, this would imply
that the EU Commission’s long-standing preference for EU-origin products has been
incorrect, which is clearly not the case.


A binding directive would safeguard the future of the EU electronics industry while delivering
broader benefits to other sectors. By ensuring that public funds stay within the EU, we provide
essential support for European industries, enabling continued innovation and sustainable
growth.


The availability of European alternatives for non-EU products, particularly in electronics,
further justifies this measure. Our students and professionals deserve access to these
resources, fostering stronger engagement with the European industry from the start of their
careers.

## Costs and Timeframe


This directive involves no direct financial costs. On the contrary, it has the potential to
generate billions of euros in economic value for the EU. By implementing "EU Origin First", we
foster local industries, promote sustainable production, and uphold ethical standards
aligned with the Green Deal.


The timeframe for implementation is favourable, as existing tracking mechanisms for EUorigin products are already in place. The necessary legislative adjustments would be
relatively simple.

## Conclusion

Formalising the "EU Origin First" principle into a directive is a practical, cost-e\ective solution
that supports Europe’s long-term economic and environmental objectives.

It reinforces ethical standards, aligns with the Green Deal, and strengthens Europe’s internal
market by directly supporting European industries and education.


The benefits are clear, and the implementation path is straightforward.

I firmly believe that this proposal, like many others, is a logical, necessary step that will deliver
significant advantages for the EU and its citizens.

Take this for what it is worth, but in my view, the time for action has long since arrived. Endless
discussions without decisions are no longer an option.

With motivated regards,

#EUIndustry #EuropeFirst #PublicFunds #Manufacturing #TechPolicy

### COMMENT


What are public funds? Many seem to have forgotten. They are tax money collected from
businesses and individuals to shape society according to our democratically set values. In Europe,
this system works reasonably well, better than in most of the world.


Taxes from businesses, workers, and retirees should fund initiatives that benefit all. Yet when
subsidies are allocated, this principle often becomes unclear. At times, it seems more transparent


to write a cheque directly to a non-European government or company, but would any policymaker
dare tell taxpayers their money is leaving the EU?


It is simple: public funds should return value to the society we are building. What’s clearer than
ensuring they are spent on EU-origin goods and services?


A stadium announcer could explain this to 50,000 football fans in ten minutes and have them doing
a Mexican wave in agreement. It’s pure common sense, so why are EU member states still not
applying it?


# Creation of an EU Electronics Raw Materials Database

_19 February 2025_

I propose the establishment of an **EU Electronics Raw Materials Database** to address the
increasing administrative burdens associated with the Green Deal, while also promoting the
digitalisation and automation of processes within the electronics industry. This proposal
aligns with the European Commission’s stated goal of reducing administrative burdens by
25% and streamlining reporting requirements for companies across the EU.
## Goals and Rationale

The primary goal of this proposal is to significantly reduce the administrative workload that
will inevitably arise due to the reporting obligations imposed by the Green Deal. While the
Green Deal’s environmental objectives are vital, without this database, I foresee a substantial
increase in administrative complexity for electronics developers, resulting in an estimated
250% rise in associated reporting burdens. This would come at a considerable financial cost
to the industry, far outweighing the intended benefits of the policy.

Currently, developers are required to document in great detail the raw materials used in their
designs, ranging from electronic components to printed circuit boards (PCBs), and provide
precise information on the CO2 impact of each component. Given the scale of this
requirement and the number of developers involved across the EU, this task will involve
hundreds of thousands of developers spending countless hours gathering data. With an
estimated average hourly cost of €50, the total expense could run into the billions annually, all
with little added value.
## Proposed Solution: Centralised Database

The solution I propose is straightforward. The detailed information that developers need to
report already exists with the manufacturers of these electronic components and raw
materials. Rather than tasking every developer with gathering this data individually, we should
require manufacturers to register all relevant components and materials in a **centralised EU**
**electronics raw materials database** . This digital database, defined and maintained by the
EU, would serve as a single, standardised source of information for all developers. This would
eliminate unnecessary duplication of e\ort, ensuring that all developers have access to
accurate and comprehensive data while dramatically reducing the time and financial costs
currently projected.
## Feasibility and Implementation

This is not a speculative or complex undertaking. A similar database model has been in use
for the past 15 years and is already being expanded to meet the detailed requirements of
Green Deal reporting. The project is being overseen by the **EDM group**, a branch of **IMEC-**
**Leuven**, with which we are closely involved. Key figures, such as **Geert Willems**, have been
managing the development of this system, and many major companies are already using it for
their component tracking. The groundwork is already laid, and the expansion of the database
to meet Green Deal requirements can be implemented swiftly.

Convincing manufacturers to participate should not pose significant challenges.
Manufacturers would naturally seek to have their products registered in this database, given
that it represents a gateway to one of the world’s largest markets, the European Union. With


the EU’s substantial influence, this proposal o\ers both a practical and strategic opportunity
to enhance transparency and e\iciency across the industry.
## Additional Benefits

Beyond its immediate value in reducing administrative burdens, this database will o\er
several collateral advantages. It will provide EU developers and manufacturers with access to
**scientific tools** for performing reliability assessments, first-pass yield calculations, and other
essential analyses with minimal additional e\ort. This would not only raise the standards of
EU manufacturing but also present the EU with a competitive advantage on the global stage.

Moreover, such a database would provide EU policymakers and administrators with
unprecedented insights into the state of electronics within the Union. This knowledge could
be leveraged to enhance the EU's negotiating power in global trade discussions. To my
knowledge, no similar database exists elsewhere, making this a unique tool for the EU to lead
by example in both sustainability and industrial transparency.
## Costs and Timeframe

The costs involved in this proposal are minimal, given that much of the necessary
infrastructure is already in place. The database can be integrated and expanded with relatively
low financial investment, leveraging existing platforms. The timeframe for implementation is
equally favourable, as the groundwork has already been laid by the EDM group and its
partners.

In terms of potential savings, this initiative would save the electronics industry billions of
Euros in avoided administrative costs, while adding immense value through streamlined
processes and increased competitiveness.
## Conclusion

In conclusion, the creation of an EU Electronics Raw Materials Database represents a highly
e\icient, cost-e\ective solution that directly addresses the challenges posed by Green Deal
reporting.

It would enable the digitalisation of our industry, reduce administrative burdens by more than
25%, and provide policymakers with the data they need to make informed decisions.

The benefits are clear, and the implementation process is straightforward. I believe this is an
initiative that both the industry and policymakers should support wholeheartedly.


I am confident that this proposal will contribute significantly to the success of the EU's
environmental and economic objectives. Take this for what it is worth, but in my view, the
time for action has long since arrived. Endless discussions without decisions are no longer an
option.


With motivated regards,

#Electronics #GreenDeal #Digitalisation #EUIndustry #Manufacturing

### COMMENT


The Green Deal and CSRD are great ideas, but their implementation is chaotic. Why? Because
while governments demand a lot, they have not streamlined how we collect the required data.


The solution lies in digital-first principles: a single source of truth and doing everything just once.
This applies across industries. A uniform digital database for raw materials and components,
aligned with Green Deal reporting, would digitalise consultation, reporting, and communication,
maximising insights with minimal effort.


Currently, millions of engineers research raw materials independently, wasting billions and inviting
errors. Instead, why not require manufacturers, far fewer in number, to register all materials in a
central EU database? This would lighten their workload while giving engineers instant,
standardised access to accurate data. A win for everyone.


The idea is obvious. Let’s make it happen!


# Standardising Standards to support EU industry competitiveness

_19 February 2025_

I would like to bring forward a proposal that, although venturing into somewhat unfamiliar
territory for me, addresses a growing concern across the electronics and manufacturing
industries: the overwhelming complexity and financial burden of complying with a multitude
of standards and regulations.

While I fully acknowledge the importance of these standards in ensuring product quality and
safety, the sheer number and scope of them often place an undue burden on companies,
particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which form the backbone of the EU
economy.
## Goals and Rationale

The goal of this proposal is to explore the possibility of **streamlining and simplifying**
**standards** to reduce unnecessary complexity and cost. Large corporations may have the
resources to navigate the extensive web of certifications and regulatory requirements, but for
SMEs, compliance with an ever-growing list of standards creates significant overhead costs,
often making their products less competitive. Many SMEs find themselves priced out of the
market as they struggle to keep up with these demands, while large enterprises and non-EU
businesses, where similar certifications are often easier to obtain, are able to maintain a
competitive advantage.

Moreover, while we all recognise the value of standards in ensuring quality, the question must
be asked: **Do all these individual standards truly contribute to a better product or service,**
**or are they sometimes redundant?** If certain standards overlap or add little additional value,
we may be inadvertently creating barriers for our own industries.

It is in the interest of the EU to examine this issue and determine if we can consolidate or
harmonise standards across sectors in a way that maintains quality while alleviating
unnecessary burdens on businesses.
## Proposed Solution: Establishment of an Expert Group



To address this challenge, I propose the formation of an **expert group** tasked with examining
the current landscape of standards and certifications, with the aim of identifying areas where
simplification and harmonisation are possible.

The objective would be to create a streamlined set of standards that retain the necessary
focus on quality and safety but eliminate redundancies and ine\iciencies. This group would
include representatives from across the industry, including SMEs, large enterprises, and
regulatory bodies, ensuring that the diverse perspectives and needs of the entire EU business
community are taken into account.

The potential benefits of this initiative are twofold:



1. **Cost savings for SMEs**, which would be better able to compete on a level playing field,



both within the EU and globally.


2. **Improved competitiveness for EU industries** overall, by removing unnecessary

hurdles that slow innovation and add to production costs.
## Feasibility and Implementation

This proposal does not require significant financial investment. The costs of convening an
expert group and conducting an analysis of existing standards are relatively minor, especially
when weighed against the potential savings for businesses across the EU.

Furthermore, the potential for harmonising standards is not an abstract or theoretical notion.
We already see examples of successful standardisation e\orts in other sectors, where
rationalising guidelines has led to clearer regulations, more e\icient compliance processes,
and reduced costs. The same can and should be done for the electronics and manufacturing
industries, where standardisation could yield tangible benefits without compromising quality.
## Challenges and Considerations

There may be objections from certain sectors claiming that their industries have unique
needs and therefore cannot follow simplified standards. While this is a valid consideration, it
is important to recognise that uniqueness is often a matter of degree. If an industry is 90%
aligned with common standards, it may only require a 10% exception, rather than an entirely
di\erent set of regulations.

This proposal is not about eliminating the necessary flexibility for di\erent sectors but rather
about finding common ground wherever possible.

By taking a pragmatic approach, we can work together to reduce unnecessary complexity
while maintaining the high standards that the EU is known for.
## Conclusion

In conclusion, the proposal to **simplify and standardise standards** o\ers a clear path to
reducing costs for SMEs, improving the competitiveness of EU industries, and ensuring a
more level playing field for businesses within and outside the EU.

It is a proposal that requires modest financial outlay but o\ers significant potential for
positive impact.

I believe this initiative is worth serious consideration, as it aligns with the broader goals of
enhancing the EU’s economic resilience and maintaining our commitment to quality.


Take this for what it is worth, but in my view, the time for action has long since arrived.
Endless discussions without decisions are no longer an option.

#EUIndustry #Manufacturing #SMEs #Standardisation #Competitiveness

### COMMENT


Since the Second World War and the rebuilding of our European industry, accelerated by the rapid
technological advancements of the past 35 years, standards and norms have multiplied like
mushrooms after rain. An entire industry has emerged just to explain what these standards mean
and how to comply with them.


But has anyone stopped to ask _why_ ?


All these standards are the result of extensive discussions between some of the brightest minds,
each a world-class expert in their field. However, these fields have become so highly specialised
that, in many cases, _every single product now has its own dedicated standard_ .


So, what about overlap? What about the bigger picture?


These are questions I cannot answer at this moment, but I strongly feel that beyond the many
brilliant minds with their narrow technical focus, _we also need wise thinkers with a broad_
_perspective_ . We need them to step back, see the _forest instead of just the trees_, and restore some
sanity to the system, so that companies can get back to business without drowning in complexity.


# Why make things complicated when simplicity works?

_9 April 2025_


Every day, both citizens and business leaders across Europe grapple with the unnecessary
complexity of rules governing international trade. Don’t misunderstand me: within our
European Union, trade procedures are designed to be clear and fair. However, the moment we
cross the boundary from outside to inside, issues arise that highlight serious imbalances:


   - Regulations for EU-based companies and external importers are often unequal.

   - Rules immediately applicable to EU businesses frequently come with years
long delays for non-EU importers.

   - Import controls rely heavily on local customs agencies, overwhelmed by the

sheer volume generated by the 'parcel tsunami' of online purchases originating
from outside the EU.

   - Addressing violations discovered during checks is nearly impossible, as

European authorities lack e\ective leverage over external businesses and
online platforms.

   - Citizens and entrepreneurs alike face uncertainty about their rights and even

greater uncertainty about how to enforce them when purchasing from outside
the EU.


In essence, both citizens and governments would clearly prefer trading exclusively with EUestablished businesses, ensuring equal treatment under the law, transparency, and
enforceability.


Given this straightforward preference, why haven’t we already implemented an obvious
solution? Any entity wishing to sell goods within the EU should be required to operate through
a legal presence established here. Such entities must meet the exact same standards
required of every European company. It really is that simple.


For instance, applying this logic to the electronics sector would immediately yield significant
benefits:


   - Genuine importers would finally enjoy a truly level playing field, with uniform

standards applying equally to all.

   - Customers could hold importers accountable as producers, existing EU

regulations already consider anyone importing goods into Europe as a
producer, thus assigning them clear legal responsibilities.

   - Customs agencies would become significantly more e\icient, as millions of

imported parcels could be clearly traced to specific importers. This would
empower authorities to e\ectively enforce sanctions whenever necessary.

   - Governments would finally possess the right tools to actively maintain and

regulate a fair and transparent trading environment.


It is almost astonishing that something so logical isn't already standard practice. I concede
I’m no lawyer, and certainly there may be legal and regulatory challenges to navigate. Yet,
applying simple common sense, the merits of such an approach are undeniable.


Of course, if anyone has an even better solution, I wholeheartedly welcome it. After all,
practical willingness paired with a moderately good idea beats endless criticism paired with
no alternatives every time.


With the utmost respect,


**Dirk Stans**

# Smart, cunning and extremely dangerous

_21 March 2025_


We are all familiar with Asian printed circuit board (PCB) suppliers that o\er a few PCBs for
€5, €2, or even €0! But how realistic are these prices, when producing these PCBs in Europe
would cost around €1 just for the electricity alone? Do we really believe these providers
adhere to the EU's ethical and socially responsible production standards? Frankly, it's highly
unlikely.


So why do they keep doing it? What do they gain?


For me and many others the answer is clear and not even hidden: **data** . This is simply a clever
strategy to collect vast amounts of big data about Europe’s electronics industry and our
technological capabilities.
## What is the danger?


Experienced developers have known this for some time, but recent research has now
confirmed it. The study _[“Analysis of Hardware Manipulations in Distributed Manufacturing](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Studies/PANDA/PANDA.pdf)_
_[Processes”](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Studies/PANDA/PANDA.pdf)_, conducted by IPH GmbH on behalf of Germany’s “ _[Bundesamt für Sicherheit in](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Service-Navi/Presse/Alle-Meldungen-News/Meldungen/PANDA_240604.html)_
_[der Informationstechnik (BSI)”](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Service-Navi/Presse/Alle-Meldungen-News/Meldungen/PANDA_240604.html)_, convincingly demonstrates that even PCB layout data alone
already reveals significant information (pages 18–19). This becomes even more e\icient if
combined with the component lists and placement data. With these combined details, a
substantial portion of the intellectual property behind any electronic application is e\ectively
exposed.


With thousands of orders coming into these providers weekly, they are able to gather insights
into:


 - **Which components** are popular across Europe and exactly how they're used.

 - **Which technologies** are relevant and popular in each EU country.

 - **Who the key designers and innovators** are developing cutting-edge technologies.


This data is not only commercially valuable; in the wrong hands, it could enable competitors
to directly copy or undermine European innovation. They e\ectively receive a detailed
blueprint of our future.


This is all without getting into malicious, or unintentional, supply-chain intervention, which
may result in vulnerable products, but also in loss of reputation and increased support costs.
From the BSI report linked above (page 21):


_“Designing the PCB can be done by the “system development entity” or may be_
_subcontracted to a third party specialised on PCB design. Here unintentional mistakes_
_or simply bad design or designs realised without sophisticated know how on issues_
_such as side channel attacks may make a design extremely vulnerable. Design_
_elements that have an impact on the SCA resistance are for example capacitors. Also_
_intentional manipulations are feasible i.e. additional chips can be integrated into the_
_overall circuit. These additional ICs can fulfil diRerent functions: espionage, backdoor,_
_sabotage.”_


## Education is our greatest vulnerability

Even more alarming is how deeply these providers have penetrated Europe's educational
institutions. Our students are literally raised on their free tools, component libraries, and
addictively low prices. Encouraged by well-meaning educators and budget-conscious
administrators, who primarily use public funds, these suppliers have quietly become deeply
embedded.


**The result** is that foreign providers gain detailed knowledge about the potential of our next
generation of engineers. They know exactly which universities lead innovation and identify
talented students long before graduation. Without realising this, _we are subsidising the future_
_technological disadvantage of our own continent_ .

## Cheap can become extremely costly


Developers and industrial companies are also seduced by these short-term savings without
realising the significant risks to their intellectual property, and their reputation. Often, these
savings typically represent only minimal reductions in hardware costs (less than 10% of total
development expenses), while in reality exposing intellectual property and client information
to significant risk. Additionally, companies become locked into unique parts MPNs, severely
complicating subsequent production in Europe and elsewhere. _It’s deeply concerning that the_
_industry is willingly taking these risks for short-term savings._

## Governments, wake up before it’s too late!


Our national governments and EU institutions largely remain passive because they're
unaware of the true scale and seriousness of the issue. The sums involved appear small, so
the problem stays o\ their radar. Moreover, there’s often insu\icient knowledge, motivation,
or urgency to act.


But, like any hidden threat, the real danger only becomes clear when it's too late. Today, our
innovation, talent, and future economic power are already seriously threatened. _How much_
_longer can they aRord to ignore this?_

## Call to action


The strategic use of cheap or even free PCBs and components by foreign suppliers, often
backed by their governments, is economic espionage, ethically reprehensible, and illegal
according to European standards. Allowing this to happen, and even indirectly funding it with
taxpayer money via educational institutions, is unacceptable.


**My proposal** is to [implement a "European Origin First" policy for publicly funded purchases –](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/retain-public-funds-within-eu-economy-dirk-stans-mwh5e/)
the first step towards safeguarding our technological independence and economic future. It’s
high time for educational institutions, industry leaders, and above all, our policymakers to
recognise the urgent need for measures to protect our technological advantage, knowledge,
and talent.


_Let’s no longer be naïve:_ _**cheap can come at an extremely high cost.**_


## What about Eurocircuits?

Eurocircuits exists for, and thrives working with, European electronics designers. We
manufacture their designs here in Europe, in our own factories, delivering PCBs unassembled
or fully assembled. While quick delivery is important, it is secondary to our primary goal:
_delivering_ _**right first time, every time**_ .


To achieve this, Eurocircuits invests significant amounts of money each year in advanced
software development, making our PCB Visualizer the most reliable online design-formanufacturing (DFM) platform available. Our customers have free access to this powerful
resource via their online accounts, empowering them to create better products and become
better engineers. In fact, we have built a genuine symbiosis with some of our customers, right
from the start when they are students. As one of the few PCB manufacturers with a
[comprehensive o\ering](https://www.eurocircuits.com/for-students-teachers/) tailored specifically for students, educators, and student teams, we
actively invest in Europe's engineering future.


As a company that's 100% European at heart and in ethics, we firmly reject the questionable
[practices mentioned earlier. We were among the first to publicly introduce a "Business](https://www.eurocircuits.com/about-us/our-business-etiquette/)
[Etiquette" section on our website, complete with a self-imposed](https://www.eurocircuits.com/about-us/our-business-etiquette/) [NDA commitment.](https://www.eurocircuits.com/about-us/our-business-etiquette/eurocircuits-non-disclosure-agreement/)


The orders lost to dubious market players severely undermine the existence of European PCB
[manufacturing as a whole. Implementing a "European Origin First" strategy, as described](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/retain-public-funds-within-eu-economy-dirk-stans-mwh5e/)
above, would provide precisely the boost needed to strengthen Europe's technological
sovereignty.

Ever wondered how some Asian PCB suppliers o\er boards for prices close to the cost of the
electricity to produce them in Europe? There's more at stake here than just low prices, this is
about the future of Europe’s technological independence and innovation.

Behind these enticingly low prices hides a powerful strategy: massive data harvesting. Your
PCB designs reveal far more than you think, potentially exposing intellectual property,
innovation plans, and even personal details of engineers and developers.

It’s time to stop being naïve. Cheap can become extremely expensive.

# Let’s flip the narrative

A recurring and, frankly, rather exhausting question European electronics designers often ask:


_"How can you possibly survive in today’s PCB market against fierce Asian competition_
_with prices you simply can’t match?"_


Until now, my instinct was always to respond with clear, rational arguments about the
strengths of what we o\er. Yet, experience shows that rational answers often fall flat when the
person asking this is only fixated on unrealistically low prices from Asia.


Perhaps it's time to flip the narrative.


When asked, I now say:


_"That's indeed a fascinating question, but allow me to answer with a question: How do_
_**you**_ _, dear European electronics designer, justify your existence to your customers_
_when they can easily purchase your services, or similar products, from Asia for a_
_fraction of the price?"_


Suddenly, there's a shift, and a complete reversal in mindset.


After a moment of uneasy silence, the designer begins to defend their position:


_"Well, Dirk, you must understand, I live and work in Europe, where costs are_
_naturally higher. Plus, I'm close to my customers, speak their language, and fully_
_understand their needs and challenges. My colleagues and I maintain ethical_
_standards and quality assurances in our work that far exceed what we typically_
_see from Asia. In short, my customers get greater value, quality, transparency, and_
_above all, peace of mind."_


At this point, I acknowledge their valid points with appreciation and gently pose another
question:


_"Excellent. I fully agree and understand why these arguments place you in a strong_
_position with your customers. But given that, why wouldn't exactly the same logic and_
_standards apply to the services Eurocircuits oRer?!"_


This is when the room often falls silent. A new realisation sets in. You can almost see the
reflection happening. Why would one expect ethics, quality, proximity, local support, and
transparency to matter for their own business, yet not extend those same standards to others
operating under identical conditions?


**After all, ethics cannot be a one-way street.**


With the utmost respect,


**Dirk Stans**

### POST

It’s been a month since I stirred the pot with my article Smart, Cunning and Extremely
Dangerous.

Today, just before Easter, a time for reflection, renewal, and fresh thinking, I invite you to take
a step back and rethink a question we’ve all heard (and probably asked) too many times:
"How do you survive in Europe’s electronics industry with such fierce low-cost competition
from Asia?"

In my latest piece, Flip the Narrative, I explore what happens when we turn that question
around. What if we challenged the assumption behind it instead of answering it on its terms?
Sometimes, all it takes to shift the conversation is to look in the mirror and ask the very same
questions of ourselves.

Curious? Let’s explore it together.

Read the full article and feel free to share your thoughts.

# Introduction of Dirk Stans

Allow me to briefly introduce myself.

My name is Dirk Stans, and nearly 35 years ago, I co-founded Eurocircuits with my long-time
friend, Luc Smets. Today, Eurocircuits has grown into a company of more than 600
employees, specialising in the production of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and electronic
assemblies for prototypes and small series. With 95% of our orders coming through online
channels, we manufacture in both Germany and Hungary, and the majority of our customer
base is located within the EU. The choice of “Euro” in our company’s name was intentional,
reflecting our commitment to serving the European market.

Over the years, this dedication to the European electronics industry has led to broader
recognition. I have had the honour of serving on the board of the Industrial Electronics branch
of the FHI technology federation for 12 years, the last 7 as chairman. From 1st July 2024, I am
the chairman of the entire federation, which represents numerous technology branches in the
Netherlands. FHI is also a member of MKB Nederland, the national association representing
small and medium-sized enterprises, which accounts for 50% of the Dutch workforce,
demonstrating the importance of SMEs as the backbone of the EU economy.

In my experience, both as an entrepreneur and an industry leader, I have always valued
action, e\iciency, and straightforward communication. I approach every challenge with a
focus on finding solutions that deliver real value, without simply seeking financial support. I
believe in seizing opportunities quickly, making the most of available resources, and creating
significant impacts in a short space of time.

Today, I am eager to share my thoughts on the EU Chip Act, based on what I see as common
sense, alongside the practical experience I have gained over many years in the electronics
manufacturing industry. My proposals are not about asking for more funding, but about having
the courage to make decisions that will bring substantial added value to the industry and the
EU as a whole. These are actionable, practical solutions that, I believe, can be implemented
e\iciently.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing these ideas in more
detail.
