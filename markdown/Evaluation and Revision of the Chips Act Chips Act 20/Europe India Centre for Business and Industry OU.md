feedback: The extension of EU funding under Horizon Europe and InvestEU guarantees
  presents a significant opportunity for Indian companies to engage in joint R&D projects
  on next-generation chip architectures and process technologies. Indian design houses
  with proven expertise in analog and mixed-signal IP development are well-positioned
  to contribute to EU-led microelectronics research consortia, provided funding mechanisms
  explicitly facilitate non-EU participation and co-funding arrangements. However,
  for Indian firms, the concern we see is regarding the environmental compliance requirements
  embedded in Chips Act 2. Mandated lifecycle carbon assessments and stringent water-usage
  reduction targets will necessitate substantial investments in cleaner manufacturing
  processes and advanced effluent treatment systems. To ensure Indian suppliers can
  compete, the Commission should consider transitional support or capacity-building
  grants for technology upgrades aligned with EU Green Deal objectives. Security and
  supply chain transparency measures under the Act, such as compulsory cybersecurity
  certifications for chip design and production are welcome as it aims to demonstrate
  highest standards of trustworthiness. Nonetheless, the administrative burden and
  cost of achieving EU-recognised certifications may pose barriers for SMEs. EICBI
  recommends establishing simplified certification pathways and mutual recognition
  agreements that acknowledge equivalent Indian standards to avoid duplication and
  reduce time-to-market. Lastly, the anticipated demand for skilled engineers and
  designers in the EU semiconductor ecosystem underscores the need for collaborative
  workforce development initiatives. Indian firms stand ready to participate in exchange
  programmes, internships, and joint training curricula with the European Chips Skills
  Academy to build a talent pipeline capable of meeting Chips Act 2 priorities. EICBI
  encourages the Commission to formalise India-EU skills partnerships, including remote
  and in-person modules, to mitigate the projected shortage of 350,000 professionals
  by 2030.
