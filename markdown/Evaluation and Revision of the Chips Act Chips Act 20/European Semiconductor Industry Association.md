# **POSITION PAPER**

## **EU Chips Act 2: Europe’s path towards** **semiconductor leadership**


_Brussels, 12 September 2025_






### **I. State of play: The semiconductor industry in Europe**

Semiconductors are vital to Europe’s future, driving innovation and creating value across sectors like automotive, industrial, AI, aerospace, defense, med-tech, and clean energy. Semiconductors are foundational technologies for, among others, cars, smartphones, connected
wearables, wind turbines, and industrial robots, and are thus key enablers of the green and
digital transitions. The pervasive and multiplying effect of semiconductors fuels value creation
across the entire ecosystem in Europe. Yet, most demand growth and innovation stimuli are
happening outside of Europe. The semiconductor industry in Europe is facing fierce global
competition which is characterised by high levels of public investment and involvement.


Hence, strengthening the semiconductor sector in Europe is essential to unlock long-term
value, growth, and competitiveness. Europe is home to leading semiconductor manufacturers,
like IDMs and (specialty) foundries, equipment manufacturers, material providers, and RTOs.
Semiconductor technologies developed and manufactured in Europe include sensors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), security chips, microcontrollers, microprocessors, power
semiconductors, and silicon photonics, to name a few. Global markets and critical applications
depend on semiconductor technologies coming from Europe. They enable cutting-edge innovations at the heart of products for Europe’s strongest industry verticals and supply chain:


   - Automotive applications require functional, safe, and secure advanced sensing and
processing capabilities, including embedded AI for autonomous driving.


   - Industrial automation relies on safe, secure motor control and connectivity technology,
enabling robotics with machine learning capabilities.


   - Smart home / health applications need low-power, cybersecure solutions for domestic
appliance consumer devices and (remote) health monitoring equipment.


2


   - Data centres, energy grids, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure require large
power conversion and management solutions enabled by highly energy-efficient chips.


   - Aerospace and defence need reliable, powerful, secure, and innovative chip solutions.


   - Secure semiconductors for critical applications in bank and ID sectors are enabled by
smart and trusted chips.


   - Medical devices need semiconductors that power everything from imaging systems to
implantable devices.


   - Lithography equipment requires advanced semiconductors for the manufacturing of
foundational and leading edge chips.


The EU Chips Act has been fundamental in strengthening the semiconductor ecosystem in
Europe by reinforcing capabilities in research and spurring manufacturing capacity. It has enabled public-private investments in the semiconductor industry in Europe and helped increase
supply resilience.

### **II. Industry recommendations for the EU Chips Act 2**


The semiconductor industry is inherently global, with deep interdependencies across regions;
however, strong European technology and trading positions can and should be built. The industry’s integrated, winner-takes-all value chain offers Europe a chance to secure its relevance and capture value. To do so, Europe must act swiftly, leverage its strengths, and align
with market trends and demands. A revised EU Chips Act should focus on expanding the industry to meet Europe’s demand while reinforcing its position in the global value chain.


The evaluation and revision of the EU Chips Act, as rightly called for in, among others, Mario
Draghi’s report “ _The Future of European Competitiveness_ ” [1] and in the Mission Letter to Executive Vice-President Henna Virkkunen is an opportunity to further improve the legal framework
and strengthen the semiconductor industry in Europe. The recent European Court of Auditors
Report [2] reviewing the progress of the EU Chips Act indicated clearly that the Act was generally
a success, but is not sufficient to meet its ambitions. Furthermore, a group of Member States
founded the ‘Semicon Coalition’, seeking strong cooperation and fast-track action from the
European Commission to address the semiconductor industry as a strategic asset and necessity for Europe’s competitiveness, resilience, and strategic autonomy.


The revision should move away from arbitrary, overly ambitious political targets, such as
achieving specific marketshare milestones (i.e., 20% of global production capacity), which do
not reflect industry needs or capabilities. Instead, it should focus on aligning with industry and
end-market realities, and strengthening Europe’s position in the global value chain, rather than
pursuing isolated goals. Against this backdrop, ESIA presents its recommendations for the
EU Chips Act 2.

#### **Innovation focusing on industrial deployment**


It will be of utmost importance to set a **clear** **focus on** **industrial deployment** when revising
the research dimension of the EU Chips Act. Industry’s role in research must be strengthened


3


in order to reach the ‘lab-to-fab’ objective – i.e., today’s pilot lines – and bridge the gap between research and the market across all technology nodes, including leading-edge processes . Hence, the Chips Joint Undertaking (Chips JU) shall be continued, expanded and enhanced under the EU Chips Act 2. Today’s research should be aimed at winning tomorrow’s
markets.


Key to innovation is also strenghtening Europe’s existing research and development (R&D)
hubs. The EU should use the revision to push for coordination amongst Member States that
include R&D partnerships. Coordinated efforts among Member States should include both
focus on creating education programmes to address talent gaps in key industries, as well as
efforts to encourage knowledge-sharing across Member States. This is particularly important
in the semiconductor sector which is a critical industry with notably high R&D intensities compared to other industries and crucial for Europe’s industrial growth.


Priorities must be closely elaborated with the semiconductor ecosystem in Europe. In order to
**unleash the innovation potential** of the semiconductor industry in Europe, initiatives under
an EU Chips Act 2 must **include the entire semiconductor value chain**, including IDMs,
RTOs, foundries, fabless companies, (advanced) material suppliers, equipment manufacturers, and the printed circuit board (PCB) industry.


The revision should focus on conditions to innovate across all these segments of the supply
and value chains and strengthen the industrial innovation infrastructure. Cooperation with industry verticals must also be strengthened and significantly expanded, in order to closely align
with end-user industries on demand and market needs. **Dedicated innovation centres**
should be supported making such cooperation a reality and driving innovative product breakthroughs. The EU Chips Act 2 should make explicit competitive conditions to help the semiconductor industry in Europe thrive by jointly innovating and driving demand.

#### **Focus on EU’s unique strengths in AI**


Recent calls for a revision of the EU Chips Act, such as in the Communication of the EU AI
Continent Action Plan, put emphasis on Europe’s need to strengthen the design and manufacturing of chips for AI. It will be of utmost importance to address areas of AI where mastering
future breakthrough innovations will lead to a world-leading position of the semiconductor industry in Europe.


Therefore, ESIA calls for a two-pronged approach targeting foundational chips for AI and European leading-edge chips for AI.


First, on **foundational chips for AI**, Europe should ensure securing a leadership position in
the next wave of AI innovation, in particular **Edge AI**, also referred to as Physical AI. It refers
to AI computation being done directly on sensor systems or IoT devices, i.e., near the user or
‘at the edge’ of the network, rather than relying on cloud computing or private data centres.
Edge AI allows for real-time data processing, analysis, and decisionmaking directly on smart
connected devices at a time when latency and data security pose increasing challenges for
an ever more ubiquitous technology. It will be a key prerequisite for winning the next global
technology race in intelligent systems and robotics, and Europe already has a pole position in
necessary key components such as microcontrollers and smart sensors. The approach should
also include **powering AI**, addressing the growing electricity demand and need for energy


4


efficiencies to reduce the overall power consumption of AI server systems and data centres.
To promote foundational chips for AI in Europe, the EU Chips Act 2 should contain fit-for-purpose instruments enabling the semiconductor ecosystem in Europe to become global leaders.


Secondly, an approach to drive European **leading-edge chips for AI** should be developed to
ensure Europe’s leadership position in research, manufacturing processes, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It should also identify and address technology gaps and include
a concept to increase Europe’s tech sovereignty, in close alignment with the industry.


In addition, the EU Chips Act 2 should also address next generation disruptive technologies,
such as quantum technologies and neuromorphic computing, and build a competitive position
in next-generation AI solutions. Furthermore, the EU Chips Act 2 could accelerate international partnerships with research and industrial players globally (including advanced economies and developing countries), with the aim of securing access to knowledge in the areas
where Europe is not strong today.

#### **Fit-for-purpose instruments for technology leadership and indispensability**


To ensure Europe’s technological leadership, ESIA is convinced that a strategic shift in holistically supporting critical semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing under the
EU Chips Act 2 is required. A healthy and flourishing research and product development capacity and capability underpins any competitive manufacturing position. Only focusing on research and manufacturing alone is not enough, the whole process needs to be supported
operationally and through infrastructure.


ESIA believes that the existing funding **toolbox** for supporting highly strategic semiconductor
projects demands an improvement. To meet Europe’s technology leadership, suitable instruments are urgently needed to underpin these objectives.


The changing geopolitical environment and ever shorter innovation cycles, accelerating the
global race for technology leadership, require fit-for-purpose, agile instruments allowing for
flexibility, speed, and an ambitious industrialisation path.


Today, the toolbox consists of **pre-competitive** research and development programmes such
as the Chips JU as well as the **state aid** frameworks, Important Projects of Common European
Interest (IPCEIs), and the EU Chips Act. The Chips JU is very strongly focused on research.
The two IPCEIs on microelectronics have allowed for the _ad hoc_ implementation of research
& development & innovation (R&D&I) projects of major innovative nature. The EU Chips Act’s
FOAK framework did attract investments into chip manufacturing projects and capacity building. Even though successful within their specific scopes, the existing instruments are narrowly
tailored, scattered, and not always adequately adopted by Member States.


Consequently, ESIA calls for the creation of an **EU budget for semiconductors**, as Mr Draghi
also recommended. Such a budget would complement and stimulate national funding, i.e.,
provided as “ _top ups_ ” in IPCEIs and EU Chips Act FOAK projects (as currently proposed in
Article 19 of the European Competitiveness Fund, at least for IPCEIs). The EU budget for
semiconductors should be considered under the upcoming European Competitiveness Fund
(ECF) to enable fast funding for highly strategic projects, including joint ventures, relevant to
Europe’s technology leadership and indispensability in semiconductors. Such projects require
fast decisionmaking, centralided at EU-level as one single competent authority instead of a


5


lengthy process between the EU and Member States. They also require flexible eligibility,
ambitious budgets, and funding rates similar to many examples in other regions of the world.


ESIA calls for the following funding structure under a revised EU Chips Act:


(1) Continuation and expansion of the Chips JU reflecting the priorities of Europe’s world
leading semiconductor ecosystem to keep their globally leading position.


(2) Creation of a new EU semiconductor budget under the ECF, focusing on strategic pri
orities where EU’s industry can gain significant market share within the next three to
eight years, in areas indispensable for its strategic autonomy.


(3) Continuation of the FOAK concept under Pillar II of the EU Chips Act, to create the

industrial outlet for products developed under (1) and (2).

#### **More flexible scope of FOAK**


To maximise the impact of the EU Chips Act 2 and bolster Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem, the scope of FOAK projects should be broadened. These projects play a crucial role in
strengthening Europe’s semiconductor capabilities and resilience in the face of global supply
chain disruptions. FOAK projects should be considered a strategic industrial policy vehicle.


To achieve this, a wider range of actors in the value chain must be included. This should
encompass not only chip manufacturers, but also relevant strategical suppliers, equipment
makers, as well as joint ventures with end-users across strategic application sectors and startups, ensuring a **more integrated and comprehensive approach** to the semiconductor ecosystem in Europe. Furthermore, also research and product development facilities should be
included, as in many areas sustaining the European lead in R&D requires substantive capital
expenditures.

#### **Institutionalised cooperation with industry**


The EU Chips Act established the European Semiconductor Board (ESB), which has not entirely met its goals yet. The urgently needed high-level industry body to advise the ESB has
not yet been implemented. This means that the advisory function of the Industrial Alliance for
Processors and Semiconductor Technologies – the importance of which was emphasised several times in the Chips Act – has so far been weak, almost non-existent. Hence, ESIA strongly
recommends establishing a **regular and institutionalised high-level dialogue** between policymakers and the semiconductor industry in Europe to address Europe’s competitiveness
gap, focus on areas of European strength and identify areas of critical and strategic technologies where Europe has the capacity to contribute to global value chains. Industry is at the
frontline in participating in global competition and has a depth of understanding of global value
chains that is critical to constructive and action-oriented discussion on formulating policy that
can best support European competitiveness.


Such a dialogue must involve key stakeholders representing the semiconductor ecosystem in
Europe and be embedded in the revised governance framework of the EU Chips Act 2, ensuring timely and targeted policy initiatives. Such a collaborative approach will be crucial to develop and execute a resilient, competitive, and innovation-driven European semiconductor
strategy.

#### **Streamlining and simplification of administrative procedures**

Creating a positive business environment through the reduction of bureaucracy and complexity is a prerequisite for Europe’s competitiveness. Long permitting approval times for private
and publicly funded projects under the EU Chips Act’s Pillar II remain a competitive disadvantage compared to other regions. In the semiconductor industry, which is characterised by
ever shorter innovation cycles, these bureaucratic hurdles risk delaying innovation and manufacturing projects by years, meaning the loss of competitive edge.


Moreover, administrative procedures for all investments, and in particular for FOAK facilities,
need to be more transparent, simpler to access, faster to process, and implemented more
swiftly. Furthermore, clear timelines for, _inter alia_ permitting, are necessary. The Net-Zero Industry Act [3] is a good example for clarity in this context, where Articles 9 and 16 provide explicit
timelines for permit-granting procedures. This allows for long-term planning and legal certainty
for companies.

### **III. Conclusion**


Semiconductors are of true strategic importance and indispensable to Europe’s industrial success, the green and digital transition, as well as Europe’s resilience, technological sovereignty,
security, and critical infrastructure.


It is essential to develop an EU Chips Act 2, underpinned by competitiveness and capitalising
on the multiplying effect of semiconductors, which fosters innovation, proposes measures to
increase demand, defines clear priorities for semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and provides additional, focused public funding instruments.


Initiatives addressing the development of chips for AI must leverage Europe’s unique capabilities which are indispensable for winning the next wave of AI innovation and provide an exceptional chance for global leadership.


The priorities must be jointly developed with the semiconductor ecosystem in Europe, in close
alignment with end-user industries – i.e., industry verticals and enabling technologies – and
policymakers. Administrative procedures, such as approval processes, including for expanded
FOAKs, must be simplified.


A globally competitive semiconductor industry in Europe is a key prerequisite for a stronger
and more resilient Europe. ESIA stands ready to work with the European Commission, European Parliament, and Member States to achieve these goals.
