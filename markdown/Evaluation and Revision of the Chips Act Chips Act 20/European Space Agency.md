# **European Space Agency (ESA) feedback for EU Chips** **Act 2.0**

Microchips technology for **SPACE applications** is crucial for
Europe’s wellbeing and safety. Chips and PCBs (without printed
circuit board chips would be useless) suitable for the harsh space
environment are indispensable for European **spacecraft for**
**Earth Observation, Telecommunications, Navigation, Science,**
**Exploration and Security** .

Space microchips are made with ¨commercial¨(non-space)
microchip technologies and manufacturers but require specifc
and expensive additional design, manufacturing and qualifcation
eforts and resources.

Since 2000 the **European Space Components Coordination**
**(ESCC)** boards and working groups are defining roadmaps of
actions on multiple space microelectronics technology areas.
ESCC collects needs and development priorities from all
European space agencies, components manufacturers and
space industry. The goal is to ensure availability and sustainability
of competitive space microchip technology and products in
Europe, minimising dependence with USA and Asian suppliers.

**ESA´s space EEE Components Sovereignty initiative** is a recent
example of how ESA is requesting higher funds to all its member
states to further develop and improve the European space
microelectronics ecosystem.

ESCC and ESA are coordinating efforts and common goals with
**European Commission DG-DEFIS** and the **European Defence**
**Agency,** and it would be great if ESA and ESCC roadmaps, needs
and priorities for space microchips would be taken into account
by the **Chips JU** and the new in the making EU Chips Act 2.0.


We all see the EU Chips Act 1.0 and now 2.0 as an incredible
opportunity and necessary step to:

- put more resources into all the space microelectronics goals
mentioned above, helping to cover the special needs of the
microchips for the SPACE sector in Europe

- increase the European pool of experts in these highly
specialised fields

- reduce dependence on non-European suppliers, especially in
¨critical technologies¨ for ¨critical applications¨ that rely on
space systems.

**The main microelectronics technology areas** where the
**European space community** (agencies, fabless-vendors,
manufacturers, industry) would much appreciate support from
the EU Chips Act 1.0 and 2.0:

**Silicon:** Ultra-Deep Sub-micron (UDSM) for ASICs, FPGAs,
microprocessors => 28, 22 and 7nm ; IP Cores ; chiplets,
advanced heterogeneous packaging (2D, 2.5D, 3D SiP) GaN for
power ; power ICs

**Photonics:** Transceivers ; components for Quantum Apps ; PICs
Detectors CIS ; High end IR ; High end VI ; High end CCD ; ReadOut ICs

**Microwave:** GaN for HF ; SiGe or Si IC ; Packaging

**Passives:** RLC ; Energy & Power ; cable assemblies ; oscillators

**RF Passives:** Integrated micro passives ; switches ; RF
connectors Hybrids & Packaging Non hermetic ; High speed /
High freq. / power / photonics =>> SiP

**PCB & SMT** : Supply chain ; Base materials ; High density ; HDR &
High freq. / Power Mngt


**Radiation assurance:** Improve models ; New components ;
Methodology ; Need of new facilities
