To whom it may concern


Commissioner Mario Draghi’s report has highlighted Europe’s strengths, weaknesses
and opportunities for the next decade. Over the 328-page document, the word “space”
appears 291 times, showing how the space sector is placed at the forefront of Europe’s
well-being and future development. Thanks to its supporting space agencies and
industries, Europe is now a key player in the global space ecosystem, including
navigation, telecommunications and Earth observation.


However, to fill the gaps that have widened over the past decade, the current Chips
Act has invested heavily in building resilience and technological leadership in
semiconductors, which has directly benefited the space industry. Yet the current Chips
Act leaves critical vulnerabilities in the back end of the electronics supply chain. These
vulnerabilities leave Europe exposed to supply disruptions for critical industries such
as the space sector and to a loss of technological sovereignty and leadership. They
undermine the ability to deploy cutting-edge chips and to build electronic systems in
the region for downstream industries including space sector. While producing stateof-the-art integrated circuits is an essential objective, the current Chips Act overlooks
the fact that it is the complete electronic systems built around those chips that will
ultimately enable European space activities to remain technologically relevant. One
can argue that areas such as advanced packaging (2.5D to 3D), ultra high-density PCBs
and the associated European SMT supply chains need to be further supported.


To further pave the way for a future Chips Act 2.0, major space component players
and communities, such as the European Space Component Coordination (ESCC)
Component Technology Board (CTB), have developed an EEE and technology roadmap
delivered in 2025. This roadmap has been built with the support of the European Space
Agency, national agencies (ASI, CNES and DLR), the European Commission, the
European Defence Agency, component manufacturers and technology suppliers. ESCC
CTB is organised into working groups dealing with all topics to be covered by Chips
Act 2.0. In the following table, the main priority axes for space EEE components and
technologies for the next years are listed in the table below.

Special thanks for triggering this roadmap to former CTB Chairman Jean Louis Cazaux
during 10 years who retired August 2025. CTB deputy chair Florence Malou, all CTB
members and working group captains are also warmly acknowledged for supporting
the creation and update of this 2025 roadmap.

Sincerely,

Olivier Vendier
ESCC CTB Chair
