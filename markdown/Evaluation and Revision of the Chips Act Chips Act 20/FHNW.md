feedback: Europes semiconductor ecosystem is strongest when it reflects the diversity
  of its people, regions and institutions. Across the Union, many smaller universities,
  technical faculties, SMEs and specialised labs contribute essential expertise, train
  the next generation of engineers and address high-mix, low-volume industrial needs
  that are central to Europes identity and global competitiveness. These actors are
  not peripheral. They are part of the core that keeps innovation grounded and connected
  to real problems, real products and real regional ecosystems. Chips Act 2 is an
  opportunity to strengthen this inclusive model. However, the current implementation
  tends to concentrate funding, visibility and strategic influence within a small
  group of large incumbent RTOs and major industrial players. These organisations
  have value, but over-reliance on them risks creating a narrow and unbalanced system
  where smaller universities and SMEs become passengers rather than contributors.
  This dynamic limits innovation capacity, reduces geographical cohesion and weakens
  Europes ability to cultivate new talent and new ideas. A more resilient and sovereign
  Europe requires a broader base. Smaller academic institutions often provide the
  first contact with microelectronics for students. They are also the ones closest
  to regional industries that rely on customised, specialised solutions rather than
  commodity scale. Their contribution is vital for sectors such as automotive, aerospace,
  energy, medical devices and scientific equipment, where Europe remains strong precisely
  because it embraces complexity rather than mass production. Supporting this long-tail
  segment of the ecosystem is not a sentimental choice. It is a strategic necessity.
  Chips Act 2 should therefore ensure that smaller universities, SMEs and regional
  centres have direct, fair access to design tools, pilot lines, prototyping and collaborative
  projects without needing to be filtered exclusively through large RTOs. Public investment
  in major industrial facilities should be accompanied by clear expectations for cooperation
  with the wider education and innovation landscape. Europe will only achieve technological
  sovereignty if capacity building is genuinely distributed and if opportunities for
  hands-on participation reach every part of the continent. Europes challenge is to
  find a shared foundation despite the diversity of twenty-seven Member States and
  the broader European scientific community. That diversity can be our strength if
  the Chips Act reflects it. We should aim for a unifying, positive moment where every
  participant feels included in Europes technological future. Chips Act 2 is a chance
  to build such a moment by recognising that innovation does not come only from scale
  or incumbency, but from the collective energy of many institutions working together
  to make things function reliably and responsibly. Europe does not need to imitate
  global models built on consolidation and uniformity. Our path forward lies in embracing
  what makes us different and letting every capable contributor take part. That is
  how Chips Act 2 can create lasting value and a semiconductor ecosystem that Europe
  can be proud of.
