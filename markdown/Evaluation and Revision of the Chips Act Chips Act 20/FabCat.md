## Executive Summary


The current European Chips Act has successfully mobilized large-scale
investments in leading-edge nodes. However, a critical gap remains in the
resilience of **mature nodes** (22nm - 130nm), which are essential for Europe's
strategic sectors (Automotive, IoT, Defence, and Health). Furthermore, the
shortage of skilled workforce remains the primary bottleneck for growth.

We propose the creation of the **European Network of Semiconductor Resilience**
**and Skills Fabs (ERSFabs)** . This initiative envisions a distributed network of
approximately six mid-sized foundries across Member States. These facilities will
serve a dual purpose: guaranteeing strategic **resilience production** of mature
nodes during crises and acting as advanced training academies ( **Skills Fabs** ) to
bridge the talent gap.

### Problem Statement: The Resilience & Skills Gap


●​ **Vulnerability in Mature Nodes** : While investment flows to <2nm

technologies, Europe’s core industries (automotive, industrial automation,
defence) rely heavily on mature nodes (>22nm). Europe remains
dangerously dependent on non-EU supply chains for these essential
components​

●​ **The Talent Bottleneck** : The EU ambition to reach 20% of global market

share is threatened by a severe lack of qualified personnel, from technicians
to process engineers.​

●​ **SME Barrier to Entry** : European SMEs and startups face prohibitive costs

and lack of access to "low-volume" manufacturing capacities for prototyping
and industrialization.​

### The ERSFabs Proposal

The **ERSFabs** initiative **proposes a new instrument** for the Chips Act 2.0: a
coordinated network of " **Resilience & Skills Hubs** " located in key regional
ecosystems ( **e.g., Catalonia/Spain, Flanders/Belgium, Saxony/Germany, etc.** ).

**Key Pillars of the ERSFabs Model** :


1.​ **Resilience Manufacturing (Security of Supply)** : Each hub operates a
flexible foundry focused on mature nodes (22nm CMOS, 65nm, 130nm).​


a.​ **Peacetime Function** : Dedicated to low-volume production for SMEs,

innovation pilots (lab-to-fab), and strategic sectors (Defence/Space).​

b.​ **Crisis Function** : Mandated capacity reservation ("Priority Rated

Orders") to secure the supply chain for essential European industries
during geopolitical shocks.​

2.​ **Skills & Training (The Academy Model)** : Unlike purely commercial

foundries, ERSFabs are designed as **"Teaching Hospitals" for**
**semiconductors** . They provide hands-on training infrastructure for
**Vocational Education and Training (VET), Master’s degrees, and industry**
**upskilling**, directly feeding the European talent pipeline.​

3.​ **Democratization of Access** : Providing affordable MPW (Multi-Project

Wafer) runs and design kits (PDKs) for European SMEs and research
institutes, bridging the "Valley of Death" between R&D and
industrialization.​

### Implementation Strategy & Pilot Case


●​ **Investment Estimate:** A 10-year program with an estimated investment of

€4.8 billion for infrastructure (~€800M per hub) and €2.4 billion for
operations.​

●​ **Pilot Proposal (FabCat - Catalonia)** : We propose the FabCat project

(Catalonia) as a pilot node for this network. Located in the Southern
Europe-France corridor, it leverages a strong existing ecosystem (IMB-CNM,
BSC, ALBA Synchrotron) to establish a 22nm foundry focused on automotive
and industrial IoT resilience.​

### Recommendations for the Chips Act 2.0 Review

To enable initiatives like ERSFabs, the reviewed Chips Act should:


1.​ **Create a "Strategic Resilience Facility" Definition** : Legally recognize
mid-sized, mature-node foundries as strategic assets eligible for fast-track
permitting and funding, distinct from "First-of-a-Kind" mega-fabs.​

2.​ **Integrate Skills with Infrastructure Funding** : Allow Chips Fund resources to

co-finance operational costs for facilities that dedicate a significant
percentage of capacity to training and education.​

3.​ **Promote Trans-Regional Consortia** : Incentivize cross-border ownership and

governance of these hubs (e.g., utilizing the European Semiconductor
Regions Alliance - ESRA) to ensure they serve the wider European interest.

## Conclusion


The **ERSFabs model** offers a cost-effective, scalable solution to Europe's twin
challenges of manufacturing **resilience and talent generation** . By **securing the**
**"backbone" of our industry** —mature nodes—we ensure that the digital transition
is built on a **sovereign European foundation** .
