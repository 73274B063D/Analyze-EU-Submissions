**Position Paper on EU Chips Act 2.0**


_The German Electronics Design and Manufacturing Association (FED) represents the interests_
_of 700 members, including printed circuit board designers and manufacturers, EMS and EDA_
_companies, process and technology service providers as well as suppliers of manufacturing_
_equipment, software and materials._


FED welcomes the review of the European Chips Act. However, we believe that its current
focus on semiconductor fabrication is too narrow and leaves the EU exposed to strategic
vulnerabilities. We call for a shift from a “chips-only” approach to a comprehensive industrial
strategy that embraces the entire electronics value chain.


Semiconductors alone have no functionality and must be embedded in complete electronic
systems built on printed circuit boards (PCBs), PCB assemblies (PCBAs), and integrated by
EMS and OEMs. We warn that Europe’s neglect of these downstream segments has led to a
sharp decline in PCB, EMS, advanced packaging and IC-substrate capacity, growing
dependence on non-EU suppliers, and risks for technological sovereignty, defence readiness,
and economic security. Electronics are indispensable for virtually all key sectors, including
defence, space, automotive, industrial automation, renewable energy, and AI data centres.


Industry studies show that Europe’s share of global PCB and electronics system production
has fallen dramatically since 2000, while global demand and volumes have surged. This
erosion undermines competitiveness, increases lead times and costs, and endangers the
ability to meet defence needs and critical infrastructure requirements. Only a small fraction
of PCB companies active in Europe remain, and without a strategic response, European
market shares in advanced packaging and IC substrates are expected to decline further by
2035.


Against this backdrop, we identify critical market segments—especially defence, automotive,
industrial automation, and AI data centres—where next-generation computing, sensing,
control, communication and power electronics, are essential, together with ultra-high-density
PCBs, chiplets, advanced packaging and system integration. Focusing solely on high-end
chips risks creating “islands” of wafer capacity that cannot be efficiently integrated into
European-made systems, thereby weakening strategic autonomy and diminishing returns on
chip R&D leadership.


FED urges broadening the Chips Act’s scope by explicitly including PCB, PCBA, system
integration and advanced electronics packaging as strategic priorities, backed by dedicated
funding. We call for targeted EU and national instruments to support capacity and capability
building in PCBs, PCBAs, packaging and EMS, including minimum “European origin”
thresholds for critical sectors, streamlined procedures for SMEs and midcaps, and direct
incentives for modernising factories and adopting “factory of the future” automation.


We recommend establishing a European Electronics Strategy. This strategy should promote
end-to-end trusted value chains for critical sectors, use “Made in Europe” criteria in public
procurement, remove tariffs on PCB base materials, coordinate with trusted partners on
materials and equipment, support workforce skills in design, packaging and assembly, and
encourage tax incentives for manufacturing investments. Together, these measures aim to
rebuild a sovereign, resilient electronics ecosystem that allows Europe not only to design and
fabricate advanced chips, but also to deploy them at scale in competitive, domestically
manufactured systems.
