**The European Chips Act: An Evaluation**


The first European Chips Act was adopted at a time of global crisis, when the COVID-19 pandemic
and supply shortages had exposed the vulnerability of international value chains. Accordingly, it was
primarily aimed at overcoming supply bottlenecks and strengthening the resilience of the European
semiconductor industry. The Chips Act 1.0 provided temporary momentum and marked a significant
step toward greater technological sovereignty for Europe.


Despite positive impetus for manufacturing capacities, research, and innovation, the Chips Act 1.0
revealed significant **weaknesses in its implementation** . The targets set were not fully achieved, even
though new momentum was brought to the European microelectronics landscape. This was mainly
due to the unrealistic target of a 20 percent global production share. In addition, there was a lack of
measurable interim targets. Important user industries were not sufficiently taken into account in terms
of their demand structure. As a result, European semiconductor policy remained partially out of step
with market needs and was unable to achieve the desired competitiveness.


While China is providing around **€143 billion** in funding for its domestic semiconductor industry until
2028 and the US is investing around **$50 billion** under the CHIPS and Science Act until 2028, [1] the
European Chips Act only provides for a total volume of **€43 billion** - of which, however, only **€3.3**
**billion** comes directly from the EU budget. [2] These sums are not enough to establish Europe as a
competitive location and remain attractive for investments. Subsidies for innovation in the microelectronics ecosystem are indispensable, as companies can hardly bear the high initial costs of many projects on their own. Transparent, competitive allocation of subsidies and degressive design in the sense
of start-up financing must always be adhered to. Funding must be accompanied by significant private
investment. A global subsidy race is neither financially viable nor effective. Money alone is not enough.
What is crucial is targeted, strategic funding with a **focus on European strengths**, particularly in the
automotive, industrial, IoT, power semiconductors, and specialty chip sectors. In addition, microelectronics in Europe needs better location conditions, for example through leaner approval procedures,
competitive energy prices, and an excellent skilled workforce. This is the only way Europe can compete
globally. Projects that do not require government subsidies are ideal and should become the norm
through general improvements in local conditions.


Overall, it should be noted that the **first Chips Act laid important foundations**, among other things
by drawing **political attention to microelectronics** and **initiating processes** such as the establishment of competence centers and national clusters. Another decisive step was the creation of a state
aid framework that made it possible to subsidize semiconductor production for the first time. However,
the immense progress made by global competitors means that the share of European chips in the
global market is expected to remain well below the desired 20 percent, with a forecast of 11.7 percent
by 2030. [3] Even this forecast will only be achieved if Europe focuses its approach strategically and
coordinates it better. In particular, a significantly higher speed of implementation and decision-making
must be ensured in order to strengthen Europe's position in microelectronics in the long term. A welldesigned Chips Act 2.0 that takes into account the needs of user industries and learns from the mistakes of the first Chips Act could create new momentum and lay the foundation for a more powerful
and resilient semiconductor industry in Europe that strengthens the region's technological sovereignty.

**How will the Chips Act 2.0 succeed?**


**Industry demands for the Chips Act 2.0**


European industry supports the goal of strengthening the semiconductor industry in Europe and expanding technological sovereignty. The Chips Act 2.0 is seen as an opportunity to overcome the strategic weaknesses of the first act and establish a forward-looking, more resilient, and competitive microelectronics policy. Experience in recent years has shown that simply increasing funding is not
enough. Rather, a reorientation of industrial policy is needed, encompassing strategic focus, realistic
objectives, improved location conditions, international cooperation, and close integration with economic and security policy measures.


**Strategic focus and industrial relevance**


The industry is calling for future funding to focus on strategically relevant segments of microelectronics.
Not all areas need to be addressed equally. It is crucial that Europe invests where it can become
**indispensable in the global value chain** - for example, in AI chips for edge applications or physical
AI, chip design, quantum chips, power semiconductors, and advanced packaging. Greater consideration must be given to **industrial applications** in order to provide targeted support for innovation in key
European industries such as automotive, mechanical engineering, energy, and communications. The
development of AI chips – especially for edge AI applications, which require high energy efficiency for
local data processing – is particularly important in order to remain competitive in the face of current
technological developments. Their development should be embedded in cooperation with partners in
other regions. **Quantum computing** is also considered a necessary technology of the future that
should be specifically promoted.


Many innovative medium-sized companies are ready to develop the manufacturing technologies of
tomorrow together with large companies and start-ups. European mechanical and plant engineering
plays an important role here. This brings competitive advantages for new products, creates strategic
independence from established US and Asian manufacturers, and promotes the competitiveness of
European companies in the global market, especially when local suppliers are considered for advanced
assembly.


**Realistic objectives and measurable impact**


The target of a 20 percent global market share, as formulated in the first Chips Act, is considered
ambitious and hardly achievable under current conditions. Nevertheless, such a target can serve as a
**strategic reference point**, provided it is underpinned by **realistic interim targets** and **concrete met-**
**rics** . However, targets should not be defined arbitrarily but should be based on a realistic alignment
with industrial needs and market conditions in order to consolidate Europe's role in the global value
chain. Industry advocates a funding policy that is effective by targeting investments and making progress transparent and measurable. The strategic focus should be on areas where Europe currently
has a relevant base and can take on a leading role in international competition in the future. The implementation of the Chips Act 2.0 should therefore be strictly monitored, for example through regular
feedback from industry or scientific studies (and not through reporting requirements for industry), to
ensure that funds are used efficiently and the desired effects are actually achieved.


**Improving location attractiveness and investment climate**


Europe must become an attractive location for international companies. In 2025, global semiconductor
production will reach a volume of around **€695 billion** . Of this, around 60 percent was accounted for
by three major suppliers, only one of which invested in Europe. The EU should take targeted measures

**How will the Chips Act 2.0 succeed?**


to remedy its weaknesses as a location (e.g., in terms of energy prices, availability of skilled workers,
speed of approval, and bureaucracy) and strategically leverage its strengths, such as political stability,
industrial expertise, and the European single market. Tax incentives and political support for user industries, as successfully implemented in the US, could also be an effective tool in Europe, given that
they are coordinated and implemented in a coordinated manner at the EU level.


**Ensure the availability of skilled workers, infrastructure with sufficient energy supplies, and**
**raw materials.**


A key obstacle to growth remains the shortage of skilled workers. Industry is calling for targeted training
initiatives, international recruitment, attractive conditions, and close links with the business community.
Financial investment in training infrastructure and programs to retain skilled workers are essential,
including, in particular, the expansion of dual training structures. The energy infrastructure must also
be strengthened, in particular through investments in the storage and use of renewable energies, in
order to ensure a sustainable and cost-efficient supply. Location conditions such as energy prices,
approval procedures, and access to raw materials must be systematically improved in order to enhance
Europe's competitiveness. In addition, private and public investment can have a greater impact if location conditions enable increased value creation.


**Simplify funding instruments and make them accessible**


The existing funding instruments – both under the Chips Act and separately for IPCEIs – are considered too complex and difficult to access, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Industry
is calling for a **reduction in bureaucracy and simplification of procedures** to enable faster and
broader innovation. Funding must be more readily available, and procedures should be transparent,
digitized, and efficient. With its binding deadlines in Articles 9 and 16, the Net-Zero Industry Act offers
a good example of legal planning security and investment clarity. In addition, **project approval pro-**
**cesses must be shortened** so that innovations can generate value as quickly as possible, ideally
before the project is completed. Although the first-of-a-kind approach in the EU Chips Act sets important priorities but it should be made more flexible and extended to the entire value chain to also
include suppliers, equipment manufacturers, end-user joint ventures, and start-ups.


In addition, the industry is calling for an **EU semiconductor budget** within the EU Competitiveness
Fund, as recommended by Mario Draghi, to support strategic projects with centralized, rapid decisionmaking and flexible funding criteria. This budget would supplement national funds, for example as “topups” for FOAK projects, and focus on areas where Europe can gain significant market share within
three to eight years and which are essential for strategic autonomy. This would also significantly increase the predictability of investment measures, which is particularly important for the industry.


At the same time, **cooperation between businesses and academia** should be strengthened, for example through joint innovation forums and simplified access to research funding. The possibility of joint
projects - as practiced in the IPCEI AI - should be exploited to significantly reduce the burden on businesses. In addition, there is a need for greater coordination and harmonization of implementation by
Member States, particularly with regard to timetables.


**International cooperation and geopolitical resilience**


Geopolitical tensions show how vulnerable global supply chains are. However, completely decoupling
from third countries is neither economically sensible nor practically feasible. Instead, **targeted coop-**
**eration with trusted partners** should be sought in order to continue using globally established supply

**How will the Chips Act 2.0 succeed?**


chains in the future, avoid multiple investments in very costly technology strands, and at the same time
increase resilience to unexpected external events. Industry is calling for the design of the Chips Act
2.0 to be closely linked to measures for economic security and the protection of critical infrastructure –
for example, by integrating non-technical trustworthiness criteria into supply chain policy. New challenges such as increased export controls in the chip sector must be met with a forward-looking and
proactive political strategy.


This also includes securing the supply of critical raw materials, especially in the area of rare earths.
Here, it is important to diversify sources of supply wherever possible in order to reduce political dependencies. Raw material-rich partner countries such as Australia and Brazil are potential sources to
be tapped. However, Europe must also rebuild its own extraction and processing capacities and offer
European companies incentives to use them.


**Industrial policy integration and strategic vision**


Industry must be involved as a key partner in the objectives and strategies for achieving these goals.
Its expertise along the entire value chain is indispensable for determining the necessary measures.
The involvement of all relevant players along the value chain should be structurally anchored, for example in the form of **advisory committees and regular consultations**, whereby the establishment of
new committees should only be necessary after the efficiency of existing committees has been maximized. It is important to have an institutionalized, high-level dialogue between political decision-makers and the European semiconductor industry in order to address key issues such as Europe's competitiveness and the focus on strengths and technologies. The exchange must involve all relevant
players in the semiconductor ecosystem and be embedded in the governance structure of the EU
Chips Act 2 to ensure timely and targeted initiatives. Only through a strategically oriented and useroriented semiconductor policy can Europe secure its technological sovereignty and assert its role in
global competition.


**Political priority-setting**


In order to strengthen the semiconductor sector in the long term and make it more resilient and sovereign for the future, the Chips Act 2.0 must set clear **thematic priorities** in its concrete design. Without
prioritization, it will be impossible to keep pace with international competitors in the investment race
and achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. This includes, among other things, the targeted promotion of **promising technologies** such as edge AI, industrial AI, and powering AI. Funding must
have a clear focus on industrialization and future markets. International cooperation is becoming more
important than ever, and a way must be found to establish new, reliable partnerships. In addition, the
potential of dual use must be exploited.


**Key technologies**


Europe should specifically promote those areas that make it **indispensable in the global value chain** .
In order to continue to play a significant role in the semiconductor market and remain internationally
competitive in the future, it is particularly important to invest early in future technologies such as **edge**
**AI, industrial AI**, and **powering AI** . In this context, the accelerated transfer of edge AI microelectronics
into industrial applications should be given urgent priority – especially since Europe has particularly
advantageous and competitive starting conditions in this area, such as a strong industrial base, leading
research institutions, expertise in energy-efficient chips, and high data protection and security standards. From a German perspective, a strategically oriented funding framework should also include areas


**6**


**How will the Chips Act 2.0 succeed?**


of the **supply industry**, such as **EUV equipment**, **photonics**, **sustainable semiconductor manu-**
**facturing, metrology, intelligent manufacturing,** and **quantum chip technologies** . Investments in
both research and industrial production of important future technologies are of great relevance to ensure that Europe has a chance to compete with international rivals.


**Transfer R&D**


Microelectronics thrives on effective **cooperation between research, industry, and politics** . Research and development must be strategically interlinked with industry so that innovations can be put into
industrial application as quickly as possible and generate added value. This requires measures such
as financial and structural incentives to make cooperation between industry and research attractive for
both sides. In addition, **innovation ecosystems**, such as those already established in and around
Dresden, are important, but close networking structures, such as those at the German Microelectronics
Research Factory, are also important and worthy of support. This would facilitate the transfer to application and, in particular, give SMEs easy and bundled access to expertise from applied research. A
**European research infrastructure with a high level of cooperation, supraregional network struc-**
**tures**, and the **targeted involvement of SMEs** is also of great importance. This means that common
**standards and interfaces** must be established across Europe. The research priorities of the Chips
Act 2.0 should aim to make Europe the market leader for selected processes and technologies.


**Pilot lines**


Start-ups and SMEs need rapid access to pilot lines from a single source, as these are important for
further upscaling, as also required in the Defense Industry Transformation Roadmap, for example.
Therefore, regulations must be created in cooperation with existing research institutes to enable legally secure and flexible access from prototyping to pilot production to small series, and to make pilot
lines fundamentally accessible to key industries. The establishment of a central pilot line in which
processes and materials are developed and qualified, from design to wafer production to advanced
assembly, would be welcome. Such access is particularly advantageous for start-ups and SMEs, as
it enables them to validate their developments more quickly and bring them to market maturity. When
selecting a location, existing clusters such as Silicon Saxony should be considered as a German
showcase example and, where appropriate and necessary, the development of further regional centers should be expanded. Close involvement of industry is a prerequisite for the industrial relevance
and usability of pilot lines. Industrial needs must determine which pilot lines will be established and
promoted in the future.


**International cooperation: Prioritizing partnerships**


Due to the international investment race and the high investment costs, it is essential to rely on **coop-**
**eration with reliable partners** . Given the high volatility of trade relations, for example with the US or
China, it is more important than ever to **avoid unilateral dependencies** and build **sustainable part-**
**nerships** . Partnerships with countries such as Japan, or with countries such as Singapore, Malaysia,
Vietnam, Thailand, India, South Korea, and Indonesia should receive more attention and contribute to
the **diversification of partnerships** . The opportunity to create joint infrastructures can lead to a significant increase in value creation. In the course of this, agreements must ensure mutual access to
technologies and research as well as the protection of proprietary IP, thereby facilitating investment
and the exchange of skilled workers in practice.


The use of such partnerships is also important for the goal of creating robust supply chains. Developing
**common standards** with key trading partners would be a great help to affected companies in making


**7**


**How will the Chips Act 2.0 succeed?**


efficient use of trade relations. This would make it easier to ensure security in times of growing threats
in cyberspace. If security cannot be guaranteed, this has immediate consequences for industrial production as a whole and thus also for the economic situation of the countries affected. It is therefore
essential to consider **microelectronics and cybersecurity** together.


**Semiconductors from trusted manufacturers** strengthen the resilience of entire value chains and can
reduce dependencies. The availability of semiconductor products from such trustworthy manufacturers
in the EU or partner countries is essential for the national and economic security of Germany and the
EU. Semiconductor components from untrustworthy manufacturers in military applications or critical
infrastructures create security risks such as supply failures, cyberattacks, and quality defects. Regulations must take sufficient account of the risks posed by dependencies on components from untrustworthy manufacturers. Semiconductor products that are required for national security or critical infrastructure should be subject to stricter resilience requirements than semiconductors used for industrial
production or consumer goods. Cooperation with trustworthy international partners is essential for implementing this approach.


In order to institutionalize this international cooperation, **formats must be created or revived** that
ensure regular exchange and a certain degree of commitment. These include formats such as TTC,
Digital Trade Agreements, Digital for Development Hubs, or the Japan-EU Council, which have great
potential and should be utilized.


**Dual Use**


One of the many special features of the semiconductor industry is the wide range of applications for
its products. Semiconductors are important for **civilian use** as well as for **military applications** and
**critical infrastructure** . Under certain circumstances, combining these two areas can lead to additional value creation, as military research and technology offer untapped potential for the civilian sector that should be specifically activated. The economic impact of defense spending increases significantly when funds are invested in innovative technologies that serve both security-related and commercially successful applications. The promotion of system design centers that enable cross-industry
collaboration creates strong spillover effects by quickly transferring semiconductor innovations into
new applications and generating additional value. Such a strategic orientation not only strengthens
Europe's resilience but also its competitiveness. At the same time, EU goods lists need to be updated flexibly. These must be geared to the needs of the economy without losing sight of geopolitical
goals.


**Reducing legal uncertainties**


**Regulatory requirements** **must be clarified** particularly for research institutions and SMEs so that
they can compete internationally without encountering legal uncertainties. One example of this is the
ongoing PFAS restriction procedure under REACH. This must not impair value creation in the semiconductor industry in the future. Therefore, the Chips Act 2.0 should provide a legal framework that
helps to prevent conflicts of interest between the relevant areas of law. A potential PFAS exemption
must cover the entire semiconductor industry and its suppliers in order to have an effect.


**Capital market and innovation**


A strong, unified European capital market is crucial for Europe as an investment location. In the US,
a simpler and more uniform legal framework makes the market more attractive to venture capitalists.
In addition, institutional investors such as pension funds in the venture capital sector provide more
venture capital. In order for innovation in Europe to scale, the availability of capital must be improved


**8**


**How will the Chips Act 2.0 succeed?**


and regulatory hurdles removed. Progress in the capital markets union is crucial, especially for startups and SMEs.


**New challenges, clear answers: Strategic sovereignty and robust supply chains**


Increasing geopolitical tensions highlight how vulnerable global semiconductor supply chains are and
how technological dependencies can be deliberately used as a means of political pressure. Political
intervention and export restrictions have a direct impact on the industry's security of supply and production capacity. In order to strengthen Europe's technological sovereignty, in addition to targeted investments in key technologies, the expansion of regional innovation clusters, and the diversification of
supply chains and technology partnerships, **consolidated European response mechanisms to in-**
**admissible market interventions** must be promoted. Close **integration of economic protection,**
**economic security, and industrial policy** measures is necessary to increase resilience to external
unpredictable events.
