This document is submitted by Tamlink, on behalf of the Finnish Chips Competence Center
(FiCCC) in response to the European Commission’s public consultation and call for evidence on
the evaluation and review of the EU Chips Act (Chips Act 2), as published on the Commission’s
Have Your Say portal. Our feedback is structured to address the Act’s effectiveness, efficiency,
relevance, coherence, and EU added value, and includes forward-looking recommendations to
ensure the Act remains fit for purpose.

## **Executive Summary**

**The Finnish Chip Competence Center provides strategic feedback on the EU Chips Act,**
**emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to strengthen Europe’s semiconductor**
**ecosystem. Key recommendations include:**


  - **Intensifying efforts to attract investments and counterbalance global competition.**


  - **Strengthening fabless chip design competencies and supporting new industries**
**such as AI, robotics, and healthcare.**


  - **Scaling manufacturing capabilities while maintaining resilience across the entire**
**value chain.**


  - **Enhancing education and innovation to secure EU leadership in critical**
**technologies like cybersecurity and quantum.**


  - **Implementing Finland-specific measures to boost chip design capacity and national**
**IP ownership.**


**These actions are essential for achieving the EU’s strategic objectives and ensuring**
**competitiveness in the global semiconductor market.**

## **About Tamlink and the Finnish Chips Competence Center**

Tamlink is the coordinator of Finnish Chips Comptence Center (FiCCC) - a joint consortium
initiative by **Tamlink Oy**, **Kvanttinova Oy**, **Business Oulu** and **Photonics Finland** . FiCCC
connects Finnish and companies with the latest semiconductor research, expertise, piloting
facilities, and valuable networks in both Finland and across Europe.


FiCCC provides expert services for those looking to innovate and experiment. With up-to-date
knowledge of emerging opportunities, it also facilitates access to the expertise of other European
Chip Competence Centres, EU Chips Design Platforn and Chip Pilot lines.


FiCCC supports both European and Finnish semiconductor strategies, playing a key role in
advancing, enabling, and strengthening the resilience of this vital part of our digital lives.


The comments and recommendations of this document represent the views of the entire FiCCC
consortium.

## **1. General Context**

The global demand for semiconductors continues to accelerate, with the ambitious target of a $1
trillion market by 2030 appearing increasingly realistic. This growth is primarily driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), but other sectors such as robotics, 6G, automotive, and the Internet of Things
(IoT) also contribute significantly. However, most chip design activities are concentrated in the
United States, which is also attracting the majority of new manufacturing investments. This trend
poses a challenge for the European Union, which must intensify its efforts to attract and retain
investments within the region.


Geopolitical developments have profoundly reshaped the semiconductor industry, affecting
silicon manufacturing, raw material sourcing, and the overall component value chain. Major
economies—including the US, China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and India—are investing
heavily in this sector, with notable success. Additionally, investment interest is emerging from
resource-rich Middle Eastern countries.

## **2. The Role of the European Union**

Despite increased investments and heightened awareness, the EU’s share in the global
semiconductor industry continues to decline. While the absolute value of semiconductor
consumption in the EU is growing, it lags behind global growth rates, making the 20% market
share target increasingly difficult to achieve. The primary reason is a relative decrease in demand
within the EU, with few new companies or business sectors driving significant semiconductor
consumption.


For example, recent investments by TSMC in Europe are largely driven by automotive demand,
which relies on older technologies and is not experiencing rapid growth. Only a handful of
European companies, such as Nokia and Ericsson, utilize the latest CMOS technologies (5nm
and beyond). Furthermore, EU funding is often channeled through national mechanisms,
resulting in fragmented resource allocation that fails to achieve the critical mass necessary for
large-scale investments, such as new fabrication facilities.

## **3. Strengthening Fabless Chip Design Competencies**

All semiconductor business originates from industries that require advanced chips. Historically,
automotive and telecom have been the strongest sectors, but new industries are emerging.
However, the number of companies developing advanced CMOS designs in the EU has declined
over the past 10–20 years. The supporting ecosystem—such as IP providers and EDA tool
suppliers—remains weak in Europe, with notable exceptions like ARM (UK) and Siemens (though
Siemens’ EDA technology is developed in the US).

### **Recommendations:**

  - Support the emergence of new EU industries and companies that generate significant
silicon demand, particularly in AI, telecom, robotics, and healthcare.

  - Increase investment in universities to provide comprehensive chip design education,
covering the entire process from system design to implementation, test chips, and
validation.

  - Facilitate the creation of new chip design houses to support product companies,
especially in automotive and industrial sectors.

  - Ensure full financing and enforcement of ongoing initiatives such as the Chip Design
Platform (including IP and affordable EDA tools) and associated Design Enablement
teams, to lower entry barriers for new companies.

  - Promote the development of IP and EDA ecosystems, leveraging university and RTO
spinoffs as effective models.

## **4. Semiconductor Manufacturing in the EU**

Investments in semiconductor fabrication facilities are substantial, particularly for advanced
technologies. Achieving profitability in pure foundry operations requires large-scale, highutilization fabs—a challenge for the EU. The region remains strong in certain mature
technologies, primarily serving the automotive sector, and in companies with proprietary products
(e.g., ST, NXP, Infineon), though growth is limited.

### **Recommendations:**

  - Continue the current pilot line strategy but prioritize scaling up to volume manufacturing.

  - Focus support on existing manufacturing companies in the EU to enable their growth.

  - Encourage the development of new industries that will drive demand for advanced
technologies, without neglecting established sectors like telecom.

  - Invest in local packaging capabilities, especially multichip packaging, to enhance time-tomarket and supply chain resilience.

## **5. Enhancing Full Value Chain Resilience**

While current resilience efforts focus on manufacturing, it is essential to strengthen resilience
across the entire value chain. Chip design education and competencies are critical for fostering
EU-driven innovation. Technologies in strategic areas—such as cybersecurity, defence, and
quantum—should be developed and owned within the EU, and in some cases, at the national
level.

## **6. Finland-Specific Recommendations**

Finland’s fabless chip design sector remains relatively weak, with only 10–15 chip design-capable
companies, some of which are foreign-owned. Traditional Finnish industries—machinery,
healthcare, defence—do not yet leverage differentiated chips, which will become increasingly
important for digitalization and global competitiveness.

### **Recommendations:**

  - Develop national platforms that combine industry application expertise, university
research, and competent chip design teams to lower entry barriers.

  - Establish national IP libraries and supporting tools to facilitate chip design.

  - Ensure that critical IPs and solutions, such as those for cybersecurity, are owned
nationally.

  - Provide national funding for early-stage chip development, with increased funding limits
and extended timelines to accommodate the high costs and long development cycles
typical of proof-of-concept phase chips

## **Conclusion**

FiCCC urges the European Commission to adopt a holistic approach, strengthening both the
design and manufacturing ecosystems, supporting new and existing industries, and ensuring
resilience across the entire semiconductor value chain. Targeted investments in education,
infrastructure, and innovation will be essential for the EU to achieve its strategic objectives in the
global semiconductor landscape.
