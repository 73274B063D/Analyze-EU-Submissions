feedback: Flexiramics B.V. is a deep-tech SME working on advanced ceramic materials,
  we welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Chips Act 2 consultation. While
  much of the focus in semiconductor policy rightly centers on chip design and manufacturing,
  we believe that materials innovation, especially in hardware, deserves greater attention.
  Our work involves developing flexible ceramics that can be integrated as a reinforcement
  into laminates/substrate. The material can offer significant advantages in signal
  integrity as enabling low signal loss for high-frequency applications or better
  thermal management as improving heat dissipation. These capabilities are increasingly
  relevant as Europe scales up heterogeneous integration, chiplet architectures, and
  advanced packaging. We encourage the Commission to consider support mechanisms for
  materials-focused SMEs, including pilot lines, testing infrastructure, and cross-sector
  collaboration. We appreciate the Chips Competence Centres role in facilitating this
  dialogue and look forward to contributing to a more resilient and innovation-driven
  semiconductor ecosystem in Europe.
