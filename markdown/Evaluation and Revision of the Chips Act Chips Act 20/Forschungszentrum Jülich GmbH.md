  Juelich GmbH (FZJ) as clarification to the first statement: Forschungszentrum Jülich
  GmbH (FZJ) welcomes the initiative of the European Commission to review the Chips
  Act and to launch an ambitious Chips Act 2.0. As a member of the Helmholtz Association
  with some 7,600 employees, we conduct interdisciplinary research into a digitalized
  society, a climate-friendly energy system, and a sustainable economy. We combine
  our expertise in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence using unique
  scientific infrastructures. Currently, all AI activities are based on the same technical
  principles, primarily utilizing GPUs. From a systems perspective, this approach
  is highly power-consuming and inefficient, and it is expected that only incremental
  evolutionary improvements will be achieved in the future. For the next generation
  of AI, it is essential to give greater attention to the emerging principles already
  present in scientific research, including the utilization of novel devices, such
  as those based on neuromorphic computing. These principles open the potential for
  revolutionary AI implementations with significantly reduced power consumption. However,
  this shift also necessitates a highly specialized co-design approach, encompassing
  everything from application and training to algorithms, implementations, and specific
  technologies. Currently, these efforts are primarily driven by the scientific community,
  yet it is crucial that they are adequately represented in future European initiatives
  like ChipsJU to ensure European sovereignty in this field. To achieve this, the
  following measures are necessary (without claiming to be exhaustive): 1. Accessible
  and cost-effective access to pilot lines with feature sizes below 10nm to make these
  technologies economically viable for companies. 2. Integration of emerging devices
  (e.g., memristors, ferroelectric transistors, etc.) into pilot line processes. 3.
  Seamless transfer of experimental devices into established pilot lines. 4. Development
  of process design kits (PDKs) tailored to such emerging devices. 5. Design of functional
  libraries that provide key functionalities with these devices for use in pilot lines.
  6. Enhancement of development workflows to support these devices. 7. Development
  of co-design workflows that integrate both hardware and software considerations.
  These actions should lead to more extensive, particularly hardware-related, research
  and transfer of future AI principles. These actions are in no way intended to compete
  with the ongoing quantum computing efforts within the EU. Rather, they should be
  viewed as complementary, with the goal of leveraging Europe''s strengths in adopting
  innovative concepts, as opposed to relying on traditional ''brute force'' scaling
  methods. Quantum chip design and manufacturing are essential to the EUs technological
  sovereignty. The first Chips Act successfully launched pilot lines for quantum chips,
  laying the groundwork for competitive European capabilities in this strategic area.
  As the European Commission prepares the upcoming Quantum Act, it is crucial that
  Chips Act 2.0 both reinforces and complements these initiatives, creating a coherent
  framework that accelerates quantum-hardware development from research through to
  industrialization. Strengthening the EUs capacity to design, prototype, and manufacture
  quantum chips will be critical for securing leadership in this strategic domain
  and safeguarding the EUs strategic autonomy.'
