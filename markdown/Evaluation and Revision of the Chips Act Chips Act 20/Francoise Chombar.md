**Chips Act 2.0 Consultation**

**27-Nov-25**

Let me first express my appreciation and gratitude to the European
Commission for the opportunity to provide direct feedback towards the
Chips Act 2.0.

Signed in my personal name, as co-founder/formerCEO/now chairwoman
of Melexis, a fabless mixed signal semiconductor company; co-founder of
X-Fab, Europe’s largest pure play foundry; independent board member at
Soitec and Smart Photonics; investor into multiple semi related start-ups &
scale-ups both directly & via funds; European globalist and STEMinist.

Today, semiconductors are the world’s fourth-most-traded product after
crude oil, refined oil, and cars. In the not so distant future, the semi sector
will become the most important industry segment in the world, in
innovation, product development and added value. It is justified that it
receives the attention of the European Union’s institutions and its Member
States.

The canvas of today is a serious one. Never in my 40 years’ career in this
industry have I seen so many moving parts, never have I seen so much
chaos and uncertainty amid rapid technological advancements and
[increasing global fragmentation. What is certain, though, is that Europe](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/strategy%20and%20corporate%20finance/our%20insights/securing%20europes%20competitiveness%20addressing%20its%20technology%20gap/securing-europes-competitiveness-addressing-its-technology-gap-september-2022.pdf)
[must catch up on key technologies, or we will be vulnerable across all](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/strategy%20and%20corporate%20finance/our%20insights/securing%20europes%20competitiveness%20addressing%20its%20technology%20gap/securing-europes-competitiveness-addressing-its-technology-gap-september-2022.pdf)
[sectors on growth and competitiveness as well as security and strategic](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/strategy%20and%20corporate%20finance/our%20insights/securing%20europes%20competitiveness%20addressing%20its%20technology%20gap/securing-europes-competitiveness-addressing-its-technology-gap-september-2022.pdf)
[strength. Let’s “move fast and mend things” could be a good motto.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/strategy%20and%20corporate%20finance/our%20insights/securing%20europes%20competitiveness%20addressing%20its%20technology%20gap/securing-europes-competitiveness-addressing-its-technology-gap-september-2022.pdf)

Europe’s areas of strength in semiconductors today are in the More than
Moore areas, in compound semiconductors, in photonics, in equipments &
materials. Europe is generally strong in R&D, but lacks the culture and skill
of industrializing and commercializing. All policies should be aligned in the
first place to encourage and step up both above strengths and main
weakness.


Furthermore, 7 areas stand out in particular:


1) STEM talent & literacy:

The European semiconductor sector, including its up- and downstream
value chain and adjacent industries, stand no chance of thriving without
an exponential improvement of the quality, quantity and diversity of
expert STEM profiles, and of STEM literacy across the board. That’s
why this is point #1.
Hans van der Loo, advisor to the European Commission & initiator EU
STEM Coalition rightly stated that “our problem solving capability must
match the size of the challenges we need to overcome. STEM is clearly
the weakest link.” Today, we are not capitalizing on our potential.
Whether we are parents, teachers, entrepreneurs, C-levels, unions,
NGOs, policymakers, etc., STEM literacy should be top of mind in this
fast-paced technological world. In particular STEM education
contributes to a more tolerant and cohesive society. If people have
difficulty reading and interpreting graphs, for example, they are more
easily influenced by fake news.
Turning the tide on STEM educational outcomes requires a paradigm
shift in how we look at learning, how we organize education and how
we maximize success through equity and inclusion. I’d like to refer to
[the policy advice briefings by the EU STEM Coalition, the European](https://www.stemcoalition.eu/)
[Chips Skills Academy, the JRC, just to name a few.](https://chipsacademy.eu/)
Concrete recommendations:

    - Collaborate with the EU STEM Coalition, they have a solid

knowledge base, a broad expert network, plenty of best
practices and their members are already embedded in the
different Member States.

    - Focus on matchmaking between declining sectors and the

semiconductor industry to re-skill and re-direct talent.

     - Facilitate attracting top STEM talent from outside Europe.


2) Energy:


Energy security & affordability are the bedrock of economic prosperity
& social cohesion. The cost of energy in Europe is a multiple of the one
in US or Asia. Our energy security is flawed and not prepared for the
electrification of the world.
Concrete recommendations:

   - Technology neutrality is key. Transcend the political and

ideological dogmas and embrace scientific & economic
realities.

   - The EU must invest into nuclear, which is non-intermittent, low
carbon and recyclable, in the first place by reviving a maximum
of existing plants in a safe but swift way (LTO, long-term
operation, is the easiest, fastest and most cost-efficient
approach), second by building next generation plants, and in
parallel aligning regulations governing installation and operation
across the EU to accelerate and to lower the cost.

3) Regulatory framework:

Though mostly well intentioned, the EU overregulates and by doing so
stifles entrepreneurship, innovation, competitiveness and growth.
Compliance is killing engagement.
Also, high trade barriers within Europe are equivalent to an ad valorem
cost of 44% for manufactured goods and 110% for services according
to the IMF. These costs are borne by EU consumers and companies in
the form of less competition, higher prices, and lower productivity. The
EU could raise its GDP by 7% if it reduced internal barriers for goods
trade and multinational production by 10%, IMF research shows. There
is plenty of room for improvement by opening protected sectors,
liberalizing services, and harmonizing regulations.
Concrete recommendations:

   - Execute a great simplification as advocated by the Draghi

report which calls out the duplications, differences between and
gold-plating by member states and outright inconsistencies.
Rightsizing the regulatory framework across the EU will provide
companies (especially SMEs) with a more equal level playing
field, lower costs and less distraction.


   - Some member states have started creating their own national

export controls. Unify export control regulations for
semiconductors on the EU level, including licensing and
enforcement.

   - Policies need to complement each other in a pragmatic way.

Climate or environmental policy, for example, must not
counteract industrial policy or vice versa.

   - Just as an example, setting up FDA-like institutions i.s.o. the

fragmentation/country we have today could boost high-tech
innovation in the health sector, a traditional stronghold in
Europe. Today, however, European health tech start-ups prefer
the US as their beachhead market because one FDA approval
opens a market virtually the size of the EU. Semiconductor
demand would benefit directly and supply automatically follows
demand.

4) Demand

Creating more European micro-electronic hardware demand, through
more innovation inside existing companies and through a well-thought
through ecosystem in which start-ups can thrive and scale-ups can
survive the usual valley of death, will positively impact semiconductor
demand which can then be more easily fulfilled by European supply.
Concrete recommendations:

   - Continue to foster collaboration between academia and industry

through joint research programs and technology transfer
initiatives.

   - Have RTOs & universities adopt an IP model towards start-ups

that give them the best chances to succeed and doing so as
fast as in the US or Asia.

   - Set up a capital markets union, the semi industry (or semi

related start-ups) could be a pilot.

5) Public financing


Subsidies aren’t a panacea and come with side-effects like undesired
market concentration, straining long-term innovation and productivity,
and increasing inequality across sectors and regions.
Concrete recommendation:

   - Rethink public financing schemes and shift away from plain

subsidies to other proven instruments such as tax credits and
significantly reduced social security charges on R&D personnel.

   - Attach stimuli to organizations receiving public financing to

integrate a minimum % of European content into their
products/services/deliverables.

   - Stop infighting on all levels, instead focus on the greater good

of the EU through complementary and pragmatic policies rather
than contradicting ones. Avoid subsidy wars between countries
by rewarding initiatives that prioritize the creation of a strong
collaborative semi ecosystem across Europe. [Heed the lessons](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/chinas-real-economic-crisis-zongyuan-liu?utm_medium=newsletters&utm_source=twofa&utm_campaign=China%E2%80%99s%20Real%20Economic%20Crisis&utm_content=20240809&utm_term=FA%20This%20Week%20-%20112017)
[of China’s overcapacity: coordinate to avoid multiplication which](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/chinas-real-economic-crisis-zongyuan-liu?utm_medium=newsletters&utm_source=twofa&utm_campaign=China%E2%80%99s%20Real%20Economic%20Crisis&utm_content=20240809&utm_term=FA%20This%20Week%20-%20112017)
creates waste & debt. Do it fast and with minimal bureaucracy.
Let’s not spread ourselves too thin.

   - Encourage sovereign wealth funds to help semi scale-ups

through the valley of death, covering for investor market failure.
Hardware like semi is harder and takes longer from lab to fab
than software or AI related ventures.

6) Governance
It is unclear how the multiple initiatives are coordinated:

[- European Semiconductor Regions Alliance (https://www.esra-](https://www.esra-org.eu/#top)

org.eu/#top)

   - Alliance on Processors and Semiconductor Technologies

[(https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/alliance-](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/alliance-processors-and-semiconductor-technologies)
[processors-and-semiconductor-technologies)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/alliance-processors-and-semiconductor-technologies)

   - Semicon Coalition (https://digital
[strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/semicon-coalition-calls-](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/semicon-coalition-calls-reinforced-chips-act)
[reinforced-chips-act)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/semicon-coalition-calls-reinforced-chips-act)

  - …
Concrete recommendation:


     - Coordinate well to avoid duplication of efforts and contradictory

actions.


7) Critical materials

Pro memorie: Ensuring a free flow of critical materials for our industry
and adjacencies.

**Conclusion**

We need more Europe but a simpler, faster and future-ready one.
In any strategic policy decision around semiconductor, Europe has to enact
a smart approach; one that mainly pursues those (relevant) investment
chunks that have the best fit with the local business texture, that capitalizes
on the strengths of that texture and that fosters a future-proof renewal of
that European industry texture.
