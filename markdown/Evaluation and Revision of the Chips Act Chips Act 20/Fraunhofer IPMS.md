feedback: 'The geopolitical changes of recent years make it imperative to rethink
  the future role of micro- and nanoelectronics (MNE) in the EU and the member states.
  The reasons for this are: - Massively increasing dependence of all major vertical
  markets (automotive, medical, and space) on micro- and nanoelectronics (MNE). -
  Impending trade restrictions and even trade wars, leading to strategic dependencies
  on non-European suppliers of micro- and nanoelectronics and threatening the existence
  of industry in the EU and their menber states. - Deficits in the implementation
  of digitalization and the use of AI in administration, industry, security, energy
  efficiency, and defense. MNE is essential in eliminating these deficits. - Military
  threats to the EU member states from aggressors with conventional, nuclear, and
  hybrid warfare capabilities. Without significant efforts in the areas mentioned,
  the EU risks losing their self-determination. Prosperity, freedom, democracy, and
  peace are at risk. Micro- and nanoelectronics provide the technologies that permeate
  all areas of life and form the backbone of modern societies, all industries, and
  military defense. The EU Chips Act 1 was a big step forward into the right direction
  and many industrial investments startet already and are in the realization phase.
  For the R&D organisations the Pilot Lines of Chips Act 1 secure relevant research
  with up to date equipment. Chip Act 1 focused in the pilotlines mainly on CAPEX.
  A future Chips Act 2 should focuse on OPEX funding in order to activate the invests
  in the equipment for research and innovation which was purchased in Chips Act 1.
  The EU needs a R&D infrastructures and Pilot Lines that are capable of supporting
  and enabling the following tasks: - Reducing strategic dependencies and building
  technological capabilities that secure competitiveness in the global digital economy.
  - Developing value-oriented services that continue to enable citizens to live in
  freedom and digital self-determination. - Developing resilient technologies for
  effective and efficient military and civil security. The future EU strategy within
  Chips Act 2 should not only focus on production numbers (20% target) but even more
  on critical issues in the world wide semiconductor value chains. This must include
  advanced packaging and system aspects. Important technologies such as AI and next-generation
  computing (neuromorphic computing, quantum computing), new memories, optoelectronics,
  power electronics, high-frequency electronics, and micro systems must be covered
  and represented. R&D organisations suffered in the past increasingly from the EU
  funding conditions: The real effective project costs of modern equipped R&D infrastructures
  cause high overhead costs well beyond the actual funding rates. This problem is
  amplified by the fact that more and more national cofunding authorities copy the
  EU rules on funding and eligibility. As a consequence, the best equipped R&D organisations
  run in a financial disaster if they acquire to much EU projects. This cannot be
  in the intention of the EU. Additionally, we need more flexibilty in the eligibility
  of costs. If we start e.g. with the procurement of consumables just with the project
  start we often get them much too late. If we start before, cost will not be covered.
  Finally we suggest to focus research, development and innovation in the Chips Act
  2 on the intensive use of the Chips Act 1 Pilot Lines. Double funding and national
  parallel actions should be avoided.'
