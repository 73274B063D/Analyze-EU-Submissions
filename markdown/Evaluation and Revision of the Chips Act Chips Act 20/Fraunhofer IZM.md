feedback: Chips Act 1 has laid a strong and future-oriented foundation for Europes
  semiconductor ambitions. By prioritizing in pillar 1 the pilot lines for the challenges
  of the next decade, the role of advanced packaging, heterogeneous integration and
  substrate innovations has correctly been acknowledged, as thereby Chips Act1 has
  targeted the technologies that are indispensable for next-generation semiconductor
  systems. These capabilities in advanced packaging and heterogenous integration are
  not just peripherals they are the decisive enablers of next geration products and
  industries that will shape Europes digital economy. With the coming Chips Act 2,
  the central challenge is to transform this technological groundwork into broad industrial
  impact. To do so, the next phase must deepen the involvement of industrial stakeholders
  and create faster, more effective pathways from research to application. Raising
  TRLs and accelerating the transfer of innovations into market-ready solutions are
  crucial stepsareas where Europe has historically lagged behind global competitors
  like US and Asia. Advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration at should therefore
  remain at the heart of its innovation strategy. These technologies determine performance,
  energy efficiency, form factor, and system functionality - - and modern semiconductors
  rely synergically on such capabilities. Advanced packaging and heterogenous integraion
  innovations define the competitiveness of semiconductor-based productsfrom high-performance
  computing and communication systems to AI accelerators, automotive electronics,
  medical devices, and emerging edge applications. Without strong European capabilities
  in this domain, even the most advanced chip designs cannot be realized, commercialized,
  or secured within Europe. Recent supply-chain disruptions have shown how fragile
  global dependencies can beeven for packaging steps that are far less complex than
  the innovations Europe now aims to develop. Europe cannot afford to be exposed again.
  Building resilient, high-performance, European-based advanced packaging and heterogeneous
  integration capabilities is therefore not simply beneficial but rather essential.
  Chips Act 2 can catalyze this transformation by ensuring that pilot lines have the
  operational capacity and mandate to rapidly elevate TRLs, enabling seamless knowledge
  and technology transfer to industrial users. This will not only sustain the innovation
  momentum of Chips Act 1 but unlock the full value of Europe's research excellence
  far beyond advanced node semiconductors, but rather for all industries requiring
  electronic systems. By embracing this vision, Chips Act 2 can position Europe at
  the forefront of next-generation electronic systemsensuring that Europe designs
  them, builds them throughout the full value chain - and benefits from them. Strengthening
  advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration is one of the keys to making this
  vision a reality for the entire European electronics ecosystem.
