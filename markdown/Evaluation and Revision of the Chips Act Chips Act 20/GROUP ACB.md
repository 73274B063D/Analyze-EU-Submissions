feedback: The European Unions Chips Act has been a pivotal step in fostering semiconductor
  innovation, enhancing resilience, and securing the future of the regions digital
  economy. However, for the EU to achieve its goals of technological sovereignty and
  global competitiveness, it is critical to recognize the interdependent nature of
  semiconductor manufacturing with other foundational components of modern electronics.
  Among these, Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and Printed Circuit Board Assemblies
  (PCBAs) play a vital yet often underappreciated role in the broader semiconductor
  ecosystem. Their inclusion in the Chips Act 2.0 is not only logical but also essential
  for creating a robust, self-sustaining electronic supply chain within the EU. Incentives
  for European PCB and PCBA manufacturers should be introduced to encourage local
  production, reduce costs, and ensure that European companies are not dependent on
  foreign suppliers for these critical components. Establishing a strong PCB/PCBA
  manufacturing base is essential for the long-term health of Europes electronics
  industry. A good example of how local PCB procurement is discouraged today is the
  current custom duties regulation. The base materials (resin impregnated glass fibers,
  Copper clads,) needed to manufacture PCBs on EU soil are produced mainly in SEA.
  The PCB manufacturers need to pay custom duties on these essential base materials
  ranging between 5 and 7%. PCBs manufactured in China and imported into the EU are
  exempt from custom duties leading to an unleveled playing field and competitive
  disadvantage that discourages local EU fabrication of PCB. The defense, space, and
  aviation sectors are among the most critical industries in the world, involving
  technologies that are essential to national security, technological leadership,
  and global competitiveness. At the heart of these technologies are Printed Circuit
  Boards (PCBs), which serve as the backbone for the electrical systems that power
  advanced defense equipment, spacecraft, and aerospace vehicles. These industries
  rely on highly specialized, high-performance PCBs that must meet stringent reliability
  and safety standards. Given the strategic importance of these sectors, it is crucial
  that PCBs for defense, space, and aviation applications must be produced within
  the EU. Doing so is necessary not just for technological and industrial independence,
  but also to protect critical know-how, security, and innovation. Through the Chips
  Act 2.0, the EU should also further allocate funds for research into next-generation
  PCB and PCBA technologies, such as HDI, high-frequency, flexible, and eco-friendly
  boards. This will allow European manufacturers to lead in the development of innovative
  solutions that can address future needs in emerging sectors. Beside the capability
  development through R&D, capacity-oriented initiatives and workforce development
  initiatives will be essential in order to develop a robust electronic ecosystyem.
  Only by fully integrating the entire ecosystem (including semiconductors, PCBs,
  and PCBAs) can Europe truly build a resilient, competitive, and future-proof technological
  infrastructure for the decades to come.
