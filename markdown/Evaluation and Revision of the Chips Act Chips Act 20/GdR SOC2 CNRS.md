feedback: 'In todays rapidly evolving computing landscape, Europe must urgently adopt
  a comprehensive, integrated vision spanning the entire semiconductor value chain
  - from breakthrough materials and device innovation, through circuits and architectures,
  to the full design ecosystem including simulation, synthesis, and compilation tools.
  This vision must be truly holistic, grounded in principles of low power consumption,
  environmental responsibility, and anti-obsolescence, to ensure a sustainable future
  for Europes semiconductor industry. Regaining sovereignty over critical technologies
  is not optional but imperative to secure Europes future across AI, cybersecurity,
  embedded systems, HPC, real-time and safety-critical applications, advanced telecoms
  (6G to THz), and silicon photonics. Embracing sustainable innovation means minimizing
  energy use and environmental impact throughout semiconductor lifecycles, with proactive
  obsolescence management to extend device longevity, supporting Europes Green Deal
  and zero-carbon ambitions. Despite progress in Chips Act 1, Europe faces alarming
  and strategic gaps threatening competitiveness and autonomy, including lack of indigenous
  high-end GPUs, AI accelerators, lagging EDA toolchains, and deployment gaps at leading-edge
  nodes like 2 nm (which remains unfulfilled under Chips Act 1) and emerging transistor
  technologies such as CFETs, only forecast post-2032. The risk is existential: Europe
  is steadily losing control over key technological assets, worsened by dominance
  of non-European mobile and cloud ecosystems. Addressing this requires immediate,
  bold, and agile investment to close the gap with the US and Asia, stronger academia-industry
  partnerships, and large-scale initiatives to drive innovation and leadership. We
  propose Chips Act 2 fund and coordinate three pan-European flagship programs to
  secure Europes strategic autonomy: European Chiplet Initiative: Chiplets - modular,
  high-function semiconductor building blocks - overcome the limits of monolithic
  design by enabling scaling, yield enhancement, and flexible manufacturing. This
  initiative will establish a unified ecosystem and standardized framework to democratize
  chiplet-based heterogeneous systems design and assembly, fostering collaborative
  system-level research to integrate diverse functions rapidly. European GPU Initiative:
  GPUs and programmable accelerators power AI, HPC, real-time analytics, and immersive
  experiences. This initiative will provide agile access to pilot lines for academia
  and startups to accelerate prototyping of breakthrough high-end GPUs and AI accelerators.
  It targets angstrom-scale nodes, CFET transistors, 3D stacking, wafer-scale integration,
  and energy-efficient architectures, positioning Europe at the forefront of accelerator
  sovereignty. European EDA Initiative: EDA is the foundational gateway for integrated
  circuit design; without it, semiconductor manufacturing is futile. The EU must extend
  the Design Platform to emphasize system and design-technology co-optimization with
  robust IP-protected approaches ensuring global competitiveness. This initiative
  must extend beyond traditional boundaries to address the unprecedented complexities
  of chiplet- and 3D-integrated systems, handling millions of cores and multi-physics
  analyses (thermal, mechanical, electrical). By enabling agile co-optimization across
  device physics, packaging, and system-level functionality, it will accelerate innovation
  and consolidate sovereignty over critical design tools. Together, these flagship
  initiatives fill value chain gaps, drive excellence from research to production,
  and consolidate Europes semiconductor sovereignty amid fierce global competition.
  Success depends on deepened collaboration among academia, RTOs, industry, and policymakers
  - built on trustworthy, transparent partnerships fostering commitment, open idea
  exchange, and coordinated efforts to establish Europe as a resilient, cutting-edge
  semiconductor powerhouse.'
