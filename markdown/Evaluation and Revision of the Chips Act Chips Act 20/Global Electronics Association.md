# **POSITION PAPER** **Review EU Chips Act: Europe needs a Chips Act Plus**


Brussels, 25 [th] November 2025


The Global Electronics Association (formerly IPC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the
Call for Evidence and review of the European Chips Act.

While the Global Electronics Association welcomed the European Chips Act as a first step in
building resiliency and technological leadership in semiconductors, our Association has repeatedly
highlighted grave concern about the limited scope of the Chips Act and called for a broader
electronics industrial strategy. In particular, we recommend that the Chips Act scope be expanded
to cover the broader supply chain, including Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), Printed Circuit Board
Assemblies (PCBAs) and system integration, along with advanced electronics packaging projects.

As highlighted in the Draghi Report, European shortcomings in the information and communication
technology (ICT) sectors is a central explanation for the EU’s productivity gap in comparison with
the United States during the 2000-2019 period. However, the primary focus on high end chip
manufacturing has been an issue for our members and to the European industry at large. The
current Chips Act leaves critical vulnerabilities in the back end of the electronics supply chain. These
vulnerabilities leave the European Union (EU) exposed to supply chain disruptions for critical
industries and diminishment of technological sovereignty and leadership. They undermine the
ability to deploy cutting-edge chips and build electronic systems in the region for final industries.
While producing cutting edge integrated circuits is an essential objective, the Chips Act overlooks
that it is the complete electronic systems built around those chips that will utimately enable the EU
to remain technologically relevant. The review provides a timely opportunity to address this.

A continuing focus on semiconductor chips alone – whether high end or legacy – will not be
sufficient. We recall the essential point that semiconductors, or chips, have no functionality on their
own. They gain functionality through conductive interconnections with other components on printed
circuit boards (PCBs), assembled into electronic systems on Printed Circuit Board Assemblies
(PCBAs) and final systems by Electronic Manufacturing Service Providers (EMS) and Original
Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).

These electronic systems feature prominently in key sectors like defence and space. They are vital
to the achievement of the increased autonomy sought in the EU’s 2030 Defence Readiness goals.
They underpin Europe’s economic security ambitions. Electronics are, moreover, key to almost
every industry segment including automotive, industrial automation, and AI data centers which pose
the greatest technological challenges of next generation electronics in high volume.

European PCB and EMS companies signal that the current Chips Act has had no benefit for their
industry segments.

In this submission, we first provide an overview of the European electronics ecosystem, highlighting
the current existential challenges faced by the sector, and which should be addressed in a new and
broader iteration of the Chips Act. We then identify the critical gaps that are present in the current
Chips Act, threatening European sovereignty and resilience. Thirdly, we set out the eight individual
strategic sectors that are most dependent on electronics, and which should thus be accounted for

in the new Chips Act. Finally, we provide concrete policy recommendations to address the sharp
deline in European key electronic system manufacturing.

## **European Electronics Ecosystem**

The Global Electronics Association has provided extensive data, industry reports and positions
since the adoption of the Chips Act underscoring the urgency of a broader approach to securing
the European electronics ecosystem to secure Europe’s objectives at a time of geopolitical change.

In brief, the following reports show the concerning state of the ecosystem. The figures highlight the
decline in European shares of global production in PCBs, reductions in market share in EMS and
electronics assembly, low capacities and capabilities in organic Integrated Circuit (IC) substrate
technologies which are an evolution of PCB materials and processes and in advanced packaging.
Data and recommendations to address this decline can be found in the following :


  - 2023 Electronics Stakeholder Dialogue “Towards a Silicon to Systems Industrial Strategy”
organized by European Commission DG GROW and curated by the Global Electronics
Association (IPC) : [https://emails.ipc.org/links/Electronics-Dialogue.pdf](https://emails.ipc.org/links/Electronics-Dialogue.pdf)

_The report notes that a resilient European electronics manufacturing industry requires globally_
_competitive component manufacturers, EMS and PCB fabricators, as well as their equipment and_
_materials suppliers. A 2023 survey indicates more than 95% of companies believe a robust_
_European electronics ecosystem, including PCB and EMS industries, is critical to regional security,_
_industrial resiliency, and economic competitiveness. Nevertheless, a clear majority also believe the_
_EU lacks key PCB (88%) and EMS (61%) capabilities._

_Despite its established presence, technical capabilities, and skilled workforce, the European_
_electronics manufacturing industry faces challenges such as high production costs, lack of_
_investment, an aging workforce, and international dependencies for supply chains. However, the_
_industry can capitalize on growing demand and the trend towards advanced technology. To address_
_these challenges investment support, R&D, training programs, and greater alignment with EU_
_priorities are necessary_ .


  - 2024 Industry report “Securing the European Union’s electronics ecosystem” produced with
partners DECISION Etudes & Conseil & in4ma. This report analyses the state of the
ecosystem through the lens of the supply chains for 8 critical European sectors : aerospace
& defence, automation, healthcare, mobility, renewable energies, security, servers,
telecommunications infrastructure : [https://emails.ipc.org/links/IPC-Securing-Europe-](https://emails.ipc.org/links/IPC-Securing-Europe-Electronics-Ecosystem.pdf)
[Electronics-Ecosystem.pdf](https://emails.ipc.org/links/IPC-Securing-Europe-Electronics-Ecosystem.pdf)

_The 2024 study notes that since 2000, global PCB production has more than doubled, yet Europe’s_
_share in it has fallen from 13.8% to 2.2%. The EU is highly dependent on non-EU countries, and_
_these dependencies are expected to worsen by 2035 without a strategic response. Across eight_
_strategic sectors, the overall share of electronics systems manufactured in the EU is projected to_
_decline, falling from 16.7% in 2023 to 15% in 2035. Diminished market share threatens OEM, ODM,_
_and EMS competitiveness as companies struggle to keep pace with technological advancements,_
_cost efficiencies, and innovation, potentially leading to reduced economic growth within the EU. To_
_maintain its 2023 global market share of 16.7% in electronics systems, the EU must achieve an_
_additional 16.8% growth over the next 12 years above its projected growth, resulting in a total_
_electronics systems output in 2035 that is 11% higher than the current projection. Additionally,_


electronics.org


_without a strategic response, the EU’s ability to satisfy PCB demand through domestic production_
_will be further diminished by 2035. Furthermore, targets for Advanced Packaging and IC Substrate_
_production should mirror semiconductor goals in the EU. As of 2023, the EU’s share of the global_
_market for advanced packaging and IC substrates was 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Without strategic_
_prioritisation, the risk exists that these shares could drop to 1.4% and 0.7% by 2035_

Union’s Defence Agenda ?” produced with DECISION Etudes & Conseil.
[https://go.electronics.org/electronics-value-chain](https://go.electronics.org/electronics-value-chain)

_The report notes that EU’s electronics manufacturing base has sharply declined over the past two_
_decades, with its global production share falling from 18.6% in 2000 to just 11.6% in 2023. This_
_downward trend undermines the EU’s ability to meet its own defence requirements. The continued_
_erosion of this industrial base has severe consequences, including longer lead times, rising costs,_
_disrupted supply security, cybersecurity and trust concerns, the loss of strategic knowhow and_
_weakened supply chains. The European PCB industry, in particular, is at a critical juncture, facing_
_an unprecedented decline in production capacity and the risk of disappearing entirely from Europe._
_Today, only 12% of PCB companies that were operating in the EU in the mid-1980s remain active._

The first reports resulted in a 2024 [Call to Action for an EU Electronics Strategy and holistic](https://emails.ipc.org/links/CalltoActionElectronicsManufacturing.pdf)
approach that would enable critical electronics supply and manufacturing in Europe at a time of
geopolitical change. The Call to Action was signed by 66 companies, 17 Trade Associations across
the EU including National Associations, ASD, ASD Eurospace and the European Space Agency.
This Call remains pertinent and a high priority.

Electronics are indispensable to all industries, to Europe’s security, its digital and green transitions.
The revision of the EU Chips Act is an opportunity to strengthen the electronics ecosystem in
Europe from silicon to systems for critical industries at a time of international transformations.

That means boosting investment in semiconductor fabrication and advanced packaging
(component level), while simultaneously strengthening PCB fabrication, PCBA and systems
assembly (system level) for critical industries. Only by building sovereign, end-to-end electronics
value chains for cutting-edge technologies can Europe secure technological resilience, protect
strategic industries and stay globally competitive.

## **Gaps in the Current Chips Act**

The focus on Chip fabrication leaves critical gaps. This is critical as an increase in geopolitical
uncertainty has exposed Europe’s heavy reliance on the overseas sourcing of electronics for
systems critical to security and economic competitiveness (as explained in our 2024 report Securing
the European Union’s electronics ecosystem – see above). Evidently, secure, end-to-end value
chains from silicon to systems for critical industries are essential for European technological
sovereignty and strategic resilience.

The emphasis in the Chips Act has primarily been on investments in front-end chip production.
Nevertheless, advanced component-level packaging, PCBs, and PCBA delivered by EMS are
strategic bottlenecks for deploying advanced technologies in real-world systems in Europe. To use
an automotive analogy, a car with a performant engine but without wheels or chassis will hardly go
anywhere. Attention must also be paid to the systems in which chips are embedded.


electronics.org


Moreover, structural weaknesses persist. Europe continues to rely heavily on overseas capacity for
advanced packaging and assembly and PCB. PCB and EMS production has declined further since
the Act’s adoption, underscoring the lack of targeted incentives in these segments. Without
investment beyond fabs, Europe risks building isolated chip capacity that cannot be efficiently
integrated into final products, especially in defence, automotive, and other strategic industries within
the region – further deterioriating its attempts for strategic autonomy.

To make things worse, innovation is at risk as well. Europe’s chip R&D leadership will be
undermined if downstream manufacturing capabilities cannot support advanced electronic
packaging containing component- and system-level packaging innovation. It will further widen the
gap between European and Asian capacity and capability of the electronics ecosystem, more cost
uncertainty and vulnerability for critical sectors.

## **Critical market segments within Europe**

In our 2024 report “Securing the European Union’s Electronics Ecosystem”, we identified eight
sectors critical to the EU’s digital and green transition as well as its security for which we urged the
need for critical minimum capacity thresholds for electronics supply and manufacturing. The report
identified growing dependencies on overseas supply in key segments of the electronics supply
chain, notably PCBs, PCBAs, IC Substrates and Advanced Packaging.

In light of recent developments, we are reexamining the following critical market segments, which
are at the forefront of technological development in the areas of computing, sensing, controlling,
communicating and power:

**Defence** : Geopolitical tensions and in particular the war in the Ukraine have brought forward the
need for fast development of state-of the-art defence systems. This includes Defence in Space
(Satellite systems and networks), automated and non-automated airforce (drones, missiles and jetfighters), as well as ground defence systems (drone and missile defence systems) and more. All
those systems are dependent on next generation sense-control-communication electronics along
with high performance compute and power electronics including chips, chiplets, component
packages, ultra-high density PCBs and PCB assemblies as well as system integration. This
includes the availability of materials’ production within the region.

**Automotive** : The Automotive industry has been the backbone of the European industry for
decades. Due to electrification and automatization trends, the rapid technological race to catch-up
over developments in the last decade in China combined with an extreme cost competitiveness has
put the automotive business model in the Union under pressure. To re-establish technological
leadership, the development and standardization of automotive chiplets is required. While the
European semiconductor industry is strong and timely with the development and manufacturing of
automotive chips, the heterogeneous integration of chiplets using standardized advanced electronic
packaging technologies at component and system level are crucial needs to maintain the European
position as a major market player.

**Industrial Automation:** Europe’s industrial automation sector is central to achieving the green and
digital transition. To remain competitive globally, next-generation industrial electronics must
embrace open, software-defined architectures that allow flexibility and interoperability. Embedding
artificial intelligence requires edge computing combined with secure connectivity, ensuring lowlatency operations and resilience against cyber threats. Advanced semiconductor packaging
technologies such as 2.5D and 3D integration are needed for robotics and autonomous systems.


electronics.org


Policy actions should focus on research funding, standardization, and collaboration under a
European Chips Act Plus.

**AI Data Centers** : The European Commission has urged the introduction of the “Apply AI Strategy”
spanning a large number of industry sectors. The industrial sectors include healthcare and
pharmaceuticals, mobility, transport and automotive, robotics, manufacturing, engineering and
construction, climate and environment, energy, agri-food; defense, security and space, electronic
communications, and cultural, creative and media sectors. To enable this strategy, and to maintain
European sovereignty, it is crucial to develop the capabilities and capacities to build AI HighPerformance Compute (HPC) Centers for Cloud and Edge-Computing Applications. Significant
effort is critical to build semiconductior factories to produce the highest level next generation AI
chips as well as packaging facilities on that level. IC-substrate as well as PCB assembly capabilities
and capacities for these super advanced packages with high form factors need to be developed by
Substrate, PCB and PCBA Electronics Manufacturing Industries.

**Technological and Industrial Shifts**
Advanced Electronics Packaging (AEP) = silicon to systems integration. To be resilient, Europe
must build capabilities and capacities in component- and system-level packaging including PCB
and PCBA and final system assembly and integration beyond semiconductors and advanced
packages (AP).

To this end, the following observations must be accounted for as essential building blocks:

**Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) remain indispensable:** Printed circuit boards are the interface for
advanced packages and are critical for defense and high-reliability industries. Future
competitiveness depends on next generation PCB technologies and trusted manufacturing. Ultra
high-density interconnects (uHDI) and embedded components, as well as novel materials that meet
the requirements of next-generation advanced packages, must be widely introduced across the
European PCB industry. European PCB manufacturers need financial support to upgrade and
expand production facilities within the region.

**EMS modernisation and factory of the future** : European EMS companies need support for
automation, advanced equipment and scale to produce secure, complex systems domestically. The
technological demands for EMS are becoming far more challenging, and only a few companies
around the world are grappling with how to meet these technology requirements driven by
advancements in semiconductor technology and requirements projected by high-performance and
edge compute applications. The next generation of AI hardware uses large multi-chip modules
(MCMs) with a rapidly growing number of interconnections, with decreasing distances between
them. This presents significant challenges in terms of warpage, power dissipation, and signal
integrity, necessitating innovative materials, manufacturing processes, and testing strategies.

## **Policy Recommendations**

The sharp decline in the manufacturing in Europe of key electronic systems is fast becoming a
significant point of European vulnerability. While the European Chips Act was an important first
step, by focusing almost singularly on semiconductors, the region has not appropriately addressed
the increasing dependencies of strategically important European industries. Moreover, the
experience of Nexperia has shown that a focus on building production capacities for high end chips
alone does not equate to supply chain security for European industries.


electronics.org


The Global Electronics Association recommends a shift in policy emphasis from the Digital Decade
target of reaching 20% of global production of cutting edge semiconductors to a more holistic
approach to address the needs of critical European industries. Ensuring, in parallel, that chips
developed in Europe can be deployed in systems produced in the region.

In this context, the Global Electronics Association makes the following Recommendations :


  - **Broaden the Chips Act’s scope** from silicon to systems to reaffirm the importance of
Advanced Electronics Packaging **Explicitly include in scope PCB, PCBA and system**
**integration** as strategic priorities alongside chip fabrication and advanced packaging.
Dedicated funds for these segments and industries should be made available in the Chips
Act.


  - In general, amend the Chips Act to **support the downstream electronics value chain as**
**a whole** . This would ensure opportunities are not missed for the European industry as a
whole, which could compromise the EU’s achievement of its strategic policy objectives.


  - In the context of the Chips Act or a dedicated separate Instrument, **create targeted funding**
**for PCB, PCBA, and advanced electronics packaging projects serving critical**
**industries** to address strategic dependencies and vulnerabilities and ensure that European
companies remain viable. Moreover, there needs to be funding opportunities to support PCB
and PCBA capacities and capabilities that meet a minimum strategic threshold of European
origin to meet the required industrial autonomy. This is partly an industrial strategy choice
combined with the demand of critical industries.


  - **EU funding for electronics for strategic manufacturing projects** should also be created
to provide direct EU support in complement to Member State-level funding. It should provide
direct financial incentives for establishing and modernising key electronics manufacturing
facilities. As highlighted in the Draghi Report, a centralised EU budgetary allocation,
complemetary to Member States’ allocations and dedicated to semiconductors, is needed.
However, it should extend beyond semiconductors. Such a fund should be prioritised in the
near term and as part of the European Competitiveness Fund (ECF), in order to secure
Europe’s urgent response to its electronic manufacturing crisis. A reduction in overall
complexity and the streamlining of the administrative burden should be the hallmark as the
majority of European electronics manufacturing companies are SMEs and/or midcaps. The
complex processes they must go through constitute a competitive disadvantage and
additional hurdles standing between them and supplying Europe with the electronics it
needs.


  - **Create a Standing Dialogue** between policymakers and the European electronics
ecosystem within the governance of the Chips Act. This Dialogue should serve to identify
requirements, gaps and needs for critical industries and infrastructure and for
competitiveness in a dynamic fashion, identifying and addressing funding gaps across the
electronics ecosystem at EU level. The European electronics industry is an essential
strategic partner for Europe’s success, with dialogue playing a key role in ensuring it enables
the EU’s wider objectives as needed.


  - **Launch a European Electronics Strategy** to complement the Chips Act focused on
building trusted, end-to-end manufacturing capabilities and capacities serving critical market

segments. The strategy should contribute to the EU’s Defence Readiness 2030 plan and
economic security strategy. To this end, it should include:


§ A holistic approach to the electronics ecosystem, identifying the strategic importance of
Advanced Electronics Packaging which includes PCBs, PCBAs, and final systems in
addition to semiconductor chips, advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration
for critical European sectors.

§ Incentivising OEM participation by encouraging and incentivising sourcing and
production of trusted electronics Made in Europe for identified critical sectors. A demand
signal is key to future needed investments.

§ Supporting the introduction of Made in Europe criteria for public procurement in strategic
sectors which take into account electronics to strengthen European sourcing for defence
and critical infrastructure.

§ Accelerating the removal of tariffs on base materials for Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs).
As highlighted in our 2023 Electronics Stakeholder Dialogue, companies pay tariffs on
the import of base materials needed to produce PCBs but there are no tariffs on bare
PCBs that are imported for assembly.

§ Strengthening coordination with trusted trading partners to develop complementary
packaging and integration capacity and to address needs for raw and base materials
and equipment across the ecosystem, mapping requirements. To this end, the proposed
Standing Dialogue would also serve to identify needs in a dynamic fashion.

§ Working with industry and academia to develop a skilled workforce capable of working
across the developing requirements of design, packaging and assembly.

§ Recommending the introduction at National level of tax incentives for manufacturing
investments including for PCB and EMS companies.
