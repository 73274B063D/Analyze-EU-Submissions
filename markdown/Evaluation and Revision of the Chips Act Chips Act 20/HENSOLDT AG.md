feedback: 'HENSOLDT is a global leader in sensor solutions for defence and security
  applications. With a strong presence in key markets, the company leverages cutting-edge
  technology to address the most pressing challenges faced by armed forces, security
  agencies, and industrial partners worldwide. HENSOLDT welcomes the opportunity to
  give feedback through this public consultation and calls for the specific needs
  of the European defence industry to be fully addressed in the context of the review
  of the EU Chips Act, as follows: Access to Custom Designs: For the defence sector,
  custom designs are only feasible in less advanced technologies, such as 22nm from
  Globalfoundries, utilizing standard UCIe packaging. It is crucial that we have ITAR-free
  access to these technologies, also for lower volumes in Europe to support defence
  applications. Advanced CMOS Nodes: The availability of more advanced CMOS nodes
  and corresponding design houses that provide products (e.g., AI, FPGAs, CPUs) in
  Europe is essential. In this context, the defence industry with its low volume will
  primarily act as an end-user rather than engaging in custom designs, and it will
  not significantly contribute to the necessary production volumes. Inclusion in Funding
  Initiatives: It is vital that the EU Chips Act does not exclude the defence industry
  from funding opportunities, as seen with ChipsJU. While we can submit proposals,
  they should not be limited to non-defence or dual-use products.'
