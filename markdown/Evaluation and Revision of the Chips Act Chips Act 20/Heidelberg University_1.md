feedback: 'My Background: I have been teaching for many years on microelectronics
  and we have submitted close to 80 different designs over the years in several different
  technologies, therefore I have been deeply involved in the topic. Access to Chip
  Design Tools and to Chip Fabrication via Europractice was fundamental for universities
  to support good and applied teaching in microelectronics, as well as for ''real''
  chip designs for research projects. In order to help Europe to maintain and improve
  chip design know-how, it is mandatory to further provide a structure, support and
  funding for this. Many things went well within Europractice, but the upcoming changes
  should be used as an opportunity to improve the situation. From my experience, I
  see at least 4 areas for improvement: 1. The chips submission (tapeout) procedure
  was often slow, with unnecessary delays, and information exchange was very difficult.
  A web site where the status of each design can be monitored would improve the situation
  a lot. Final DRCs were slow by shipping files back and forth by email and by not
  giving the final DRC decks to end users. This could be streamlined a lot. 2. Running
  the EDA software required hardware and IT personell for software and design kit
  installation. Such positions are very difficult to establish and fill at universities
  so that it can be difficult to maintain a running design infrastructure. A cloud
  based solution would simplify this A LOT and would give much easier access to more
  technology options (as they do not need to be installed locally). Also, compute
  hardware would be more powerful. As heavy hardware is often only required temporarily
  (for large simulations or checks), it would be much more efficient to share hardware.
  Cost for this could be partially charged to universities because we save own hardware
  and personnel. 3. It has been hard or impossible to get technical support on technologies
  for more tricky questions, because the experts sitting at the vendors are often
  shielded from University users. A help desk for such questions would improve the
  situation a lot and avoid unnecessary mistakes. One possibility to implement this
  is to support university groups, who have deep experience in a particular topic,
  to act as a help desk for this topic. This would require (limited) financial support
  and in particular coordination of such expert access. We at Heidelberg could for
  instance provide support for technologies we know very well. 4. Legal issues (access
  to software, NDAs for design kits) becomes more and more complicated and a lot of
  time gets lost with paperwork. While being unavoidable, the rules should be make
  very clear and as much support as possible should be given, for instance with a
  centralised collection of NDAs for each person, a mechanism to prolong or cancel
  NDA etc.'
