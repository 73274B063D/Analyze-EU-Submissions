feedback: 'Europes semiconductor future depends on a stronger, more accessible and
  geographically balanced innovation ecosystem. Chips Act 2.0 must lower barriers
  for SMEs, reinforce Europes strengths in specialized technologies, and build true
  supply-chain resilience across all Member States not only regions with existing
  mega-fabs. 1. Enabling an Accessible, Pan-European Semiconductor Ecosystem for SMEs
  SMEs, design houses, research labs, and fabless startups represent much of Europes
  innovation capacity but face high entry barriers: costly design tools, limited MPW
  access, insufficient packaging/test infrastructure, and fragmented support. HETiA
  recommends that Chips Act 2.0: Build shared European design infrastructure with
  subsidized access to EDA tools, IP libraries, secure cloud environments, and training.
  Expand affordable MPW shuttles across FD-SOI, mixed-signal, Si Photonics, power,
  sensors, and emerging materials. Create open pilot lines for advanced packaging
  (2.5D/3D), photonics, reliability testing, and small-batch specialty manufacturing
  accessible to SMEs. Provide dedicated instruments for SME-led design, silicon IP,
  chiplets, and system-integration innovation not only large-scale fabs. Support cross-border
  SME consortia and empower national associations (like HETiA) to channel access,
  collaboration, and talent development. This broadens participation and activates
  innovation capacity across Europe. 2. Strengthening Europes Leadership in Niche,
  High-Value Semiconductor Segments Europes strongest competitive position lies in
  specialized domains with high strategic impact and manageable capital requirements.
  These technologies feed directly into defense, aerospace, medical systems, civil
  protection, sustainability, and agrifoodwhere autonomy is essential. Chips Act 2.0
  should ensure inclusive access to IPCEI AST, allowing smaller Member States and
  SME-heavy ecosystems to participate in coordinated programs rather than concentrating
  benefits in existing hubs. HETiA identifies the following priority areas: Sensors,
  THz/mmWave and advanced imaging for automation, aerospace, defense, environment,
  and industry. Analog, mixed-signal and low-power architectures for secure edge AI
  and fabless innovation. Photonics and Si Photonics for telecom, LiDAR, quantum and
  secure communications. Power electronics and wide-bandgap devices (SiC, GaN, diamond)
  for mobility, decarbonization and energy resilience. Chiplet-based modular architectures
  built on sovereign European IP for high-impact verticals. Targeted support here
  accelerates commercialization and strengthens strategic autonomy. 3. Achieving Real
  Supply-Chain Resilience Through Geographic Diversification A resilient semiconductor
  Europe must be geographically diversified and structurally connected linking design,
  IP creation, embedded software, fabless startups, specialty manufacturing and advanced
  packaging. Sovereignty cannot rely on fabs alone; it requires integrated value chains
  that guarantee sell-through into strategic domains such as defense, aerospace, medicine,
  civil protection, sustainability and agrifood. Chips Act 2.0 should adopt a resilience
  model that includes smaller Member States in IPCEI AST, enabling them to contribute
  design, specialized processing and domain-specific innovation. These ecosystems
  often deliver agility, secure subsystems and niche production where innovation cycles
  are faster. HETiA recommends that Chips Act 2.0: Incentivize geographically distributed
  capacities in design, prototyping, packaging, photonics, sensors and reliability/test.
  Recognize smaller Member States as essential contributors to resilience and early-stage
  innovation. Embed redundancy, sovereign IP creation and cross-border complementarity
  into funding criteria. Promote coordinated national strategies focused on specialization,
  not fragmentation.'
