feedback: 'IG Metall welcomes the European Commissions initiative to review the European
  Chips Act. As Europes largest union representing workers in manufacturing and R&D,
  including semiconductors and microelectronics, we stress that the revision must
  go beyond strengthening Europes technological sovereignty. It should also create
  quality jobs and uphold social and environmental standards. The call for evidence
  rightly emphasizes reducing EU dependency and enhancing manufacturing capacity.
  The revised Chips Act should more explicitly promote establishment of as many production
  steps as possible within the EU, not just for leading-edge chips. The preservation
  and creation of quality employment must be an explicit objective. Europe has already
  witnessed the near-complete disappearance of PCB manufacturing and decline in backend
  semiconductor fabrication (assembly, packaging, testing). This trend must be reversed,
  as resilience cannot be achieved without a certain degree of all parts of the semiconductor
  production chain in Europe. Achieving this is feasible with the right kind of policy
  support, as all aspects of semiconductor production can be competitively done in
  the EU. With the shift to advanced packaging, backend production has become less
  dependent on low labour costs, which traditionally fuelled offshoring. We welcome
  that the Chips Act allows member state subsidies for first-of-a-kind semiconductor
  manufacturing facilities in the EU. We note positively that this definition includes
  leading-edge and legacy frontend production, semiconductor equipment, and backend
  production. We suggest further broadening this to include PCB manufacturing and
  semiconductor materials production. It should also cover frontend and backend manufacturing
  that is not first-of-a-kind in the EU but reduces dependence on production in non-EU
  countries. Such dependence must be reduced for all parts of the semiconductor production
  chain and for all types of semiconductors, not just leading-edge chips. Most importantly,
  we call for funding under the revised Chips Act to be explicitly linked to employment
  commitments, including minimum numbers of jobs to be created and maintained over
  a defined period with provisions for repayment of subsidies if commitments are not
  met. Public funding must be conditioned on robust social standards: Job security
  commitments with binding employment levels over defined durations Collective bargaining
  agreements with recognized trade unions Worker representation through works councils
  and equivalent structures These requirements are essential, not only because working
  in cleanroom environments is physically and mentally demanding. Effective worker
  representation is necessary to develop tailored solutions with management that protect
  worker health, promote qualification as well as vocational training and ensure decent
  working conditions. The revised Chips Act should ensure that funding mechanisms
  are more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises, supporting a diverse
  and resilient semiconductor ecosystem. If their projects are not suitable to be
  considered for support under Pillar 2 of the Chips Act, there should be clear mechanisms
  to refer them to relevant funding mechanisms. The call for evidence notes support
  for sustainable production facilities. IG Metall calls for concrete environmental
  criteria attached to funding decisions: Resource-efficient production using renewable
  energy Development of processes to avoid or minimize PFAS usage Water recycling
  and recovery systems In conclusion, the revision presents a critical opportunity

**To Commission Executive Vice President Henna Virkkunen -**
**Feedback EU consultation Chips Act 2.0**

Dear Commissioner Virkkunen,

IG Metall welcomes the European Commission’s initiative to review the European
Chips Act. As Europe’s largest union representing workers in manufacturing and
R&D, including semiconductors and microelectronics, we stress that the revision
must go beyond strengthening Europe’s technological sovereignty. It should also
create quality jobs and uphold social and environmental standards.

The call for evidence rightly emphasizes reducing EU dependency and enhancing
manufacturing capacity. The revised Chips Act should more explicitly promote
establishment of as many production steps as possible within the EU, not just for
leading-edge chips. The preservation and creation of quality employment must be
an explicit objective.
Europe has already witnessed the near-complete disappearance of PCB
manufacturing and decline in backend semiconductor fabrication (assembly,
packaging, testing). This trend must be reversed, as resilience cannot be achieved
without a certain degree of all parts of the semiconductor production chain in
Europe. Achieving this is feasible with the right kind of policy support, as all aspects
of semiconductor production can be competitively done in the EU. With the shift to
advanced packaging, backend production has become less dependent on low
labour costs, which traditionally fuelled offshoring.

We welcome that the Chips Act allows member state subsidies for ‘first-of-a-kind’
semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the EU. We note positively that this
definition includes leading-edge and legacy frontend production, semiconductor
equipment, and backend production. We suggest further broadening this to include
PCB manufacturing and semiconductor materials production. It should also cover
frontend and backend manufacturing that is not ‘first-of-a-kind’ in the EU but
reduces dependence on production in non-EU countries. Such dependence must be
reduced for all parts of the semiconductor production chain and for all types of
semiconductors, not just leading-edge chips.

Most importantly, we call for funding under the revised Chips Act to be explicitly linked to employment
commitments, including minimum numbers of jobs to be created and maintained over a defined period

- with provisions for repayment of subsidies if commitments are not met. Public funding must be
conditioned on robust social standards:

  - Job security commitments with binding employment levels over defined durations

  - Collective bargaining agreements with recognized trade unions

  - Worker representation through works councils and equivalent structures

These requirements are essential, not only because working in cleanroom environments is physically
and mentally demanding. Effective worker representation is necessary to develop tailored solutions
with management that protect worker health, promote qualification as well as vocational training and
ensure decent working conditions.

The revised Chips Act should ensure that funding mechanisms are more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises, supporting a diverse and resilient semiconductor ecosystem. If their
projects are not suitable to be considered for support under Pillar 2 of the Chips Act, there should be
clear mechanisms to refer them to relevant funding mechanisms.

The call for evidence notes support for sustainable production facilities. IG Metall calls for concrete
environmental criteria attached to funding decisions:

  - Resource-efficient production using renewable energy

  - Development of processes to avoid or minimize PFAS usage

  - Water recycling and recovery systems

In conclusion, the revision presents a critical opportunity to build a European semiconductor industry
that is technologically advanced, economically resilient, socially just, and environmentally
sustainable.
