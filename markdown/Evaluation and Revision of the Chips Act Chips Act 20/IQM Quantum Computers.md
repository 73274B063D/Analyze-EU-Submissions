# IQM Position on the Call for Evidence on the evaluation and revision of the Chips Act

## Current Status: An overview of the existing landscape

The European Union is at the forefront of quantum computing research, but its quantum chip
production capabilities are limited. Only a few operators, including IQM, have their own
[production capacity. IQM's 2022 opening of Europe's first and largest private quantum chip](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2022-207-finland-iqm-s-quantum-fabrication-facility-gets-a-eur35-million-boost-from-the-eib)
[fabrication facility in Finland, backed by a €35 million boost from the EIB, is a significant step](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2022-207-finland-iqm-s-quantum-fabrication-facility-gets-a-eur35-million-boost-from-the-eib)
forward. This facility is expected to have the capacity to produce 100,000 qubits by 2030. In
line with the European Union's objectives, which include achieving 100 logical qubits, IQM's
plan could potentially meet this goal with the first industrial-scale manufacturing facility. As
the company continues to work towards EU goals, it anticipates that in the 2030’s, it will be
capable of producing systems in the 1000 logical qubit range, thereby reaching quantum
advantage. To achieve this milestone, IQM expects to require an investment on the scale of €1
billion to further develop and expand the facility.
The EU can learn from its experience with classical semiconductors, where outsourcing
production led to a loss of capabilities. The quantum sector presents an opportunity for Europe
to establish itself as a leader and avoid repeating past mistakes. While academic research has
been ongoing for decades, commercialization is still in its infancy, and no company has yet
fully scaled up production to mature levels. The current focus on building quantum pilot lines
for research and development is essential, but it must be accompanied by a clear plan for
industrialization at the EU level.
Quantum chip fabrication being a novel area of technology, the race is on to ramp it up to
mature production level. Quantum, including R&D grade low volume and low integration level
chip fabrication, has been a topic of academic research for decades. While the pilot lines which
are being built will make the bar lower for start-ups to test their technology, the roadmap of
established quantum companies requires production sites. The emergence of quantum chip
fabrication presents a global opportunity for regions to establish themselves as production for
quantum technology. Europe can capitalize on this trend by creating an attractive environment
for quantum companies to set up production sites.


## Guiding Principles and Funding: Establishing a clear plan and securing resources for manufacturing

To achieve the EU's goal of acquiring systems that can deliver 100 error-corrected qubits by
2030, comprehensive support for chip fabrication is necessary. This plan should focus on
establishing a scalable public-private manufacturing infrastructure, with dedicated funding
instruments for European startups, scale-ups and SMEs developing quantum chips. A key
challenge in quantum chip manufacturing is the transition from laboratory to commercial
production. The production of superconducting quantum processors uses traditional
semiconductor manufacturing techniques, but with unique materials and structures rendering
conventional semiconductor fabrication lines incompliant. To accelerate the transition from
laboratory to commercial production, it's essential to have a dedicated set of production tools
readily available for start-ups and scale-ups.
The Chips Act introduced a series of mechanisms to bolster semiconductor innovation and
manufacturing in Europe, notably through Pillar 2. However, Pillar 2 was not designed with
the unique requirements of quantum manufacturing in mind, which limits its effectiveness in
this emerging domain. While Pillar 2 has laid a foundation for innovation, quantum
manufacturing demands a more targeted and faster approach.

## Lessons from Similar Industries: Drawing parallels between quantum technology and semiconductor developmet

On the one hand, the requirements for quantum processor manufacturing differ substantially
from those of traditional semiconductor production. Quantum chips have specific needs that
are not met by the cutting-edge technology nodes used in modern semiconductor
manufacturing.
On the other hand, pilot-scale facilities focused on quantum technologies available today and
under development for near-future will not meet the scaling objectives needed for the error
correction and will serve a more limited purpose in R&D.
The problems and scope of quantum manufacturing are distinct, and even top-of-the-line
traditional foundries are not suitable for this purpose. The use of dedicated materials and
structures in quantum manufacturing requires tailored processes and introduces a significant
risk of contamination, making it unfeasible to utilize traditional foundries. The distinction has
significant implications for the design of equipment and process flows, as the investment
priorities for quantum manufacturing are substantially different from that of more conventional
semiconductor manufacturing. Many semiconductor methodologies for deposition, lithography
and etching are still relevant, but the dedicated features in quantum chip manufacturing calls
for specialized production lines. Furthermore, scaled-up quantum chips have dedicated needs
for quality control including the need of high-volume cryogenic characterization. This creates
a challenge for companies transitioning from semiconductor production to quantum chip
fabrication, as they must invest in new equipment, processes, and quality control techniques.
As quantum technology advances, different modalities are progressing at different speeds. To
create an effective industrialization plan, it's essential to consider these variations and develop
a roadmap that takes them into account. Companies must be prepared to adapt and evolve their
manufacturing to keep pace with the latest developments in quantum technology.

## Investment Requirements: Assessing the necessary resources for growth

Another crucial difference between the two industries is the volume of wafers processed. While
a significant volume boost over today’s pilot-scale quantum chip fabrication is needed, the
massive scale of the semiconductor industry with wafer volumes 100 to 1000 times larger than
those in quantum manufacturing is not needed. This disparity in scale means that the equipment

and process design considerations for quantum manufacturing are unique and cannot be simply
extrapolated from the semiconductor industry. In practice, therefore, the investment is
misdirected if the specific needs and volumes of the quantum sector are not considered.
Establishing a quantum foundry from scratch poses significant challenges, both in terms of cost
and timeline. A more viable option could be repurposing an existing IC factory with declining
volumes, which would not only allow for the preservation of jobs but also enable the
recruitment of new talent. This approach could help leverage existing infrastructure and
expertise, while also facilitating a more efficient and cost-effective transition to quantum
manufacturing.
Unlike some other industries, ultra-high levels of automation may not be feasible for quantum
chip manufacturing in the near term. However, some degree of automation will still be
necessary to ensure efficiency and precision in the production process. As the industry
continues to evolve, it's likely that automation will play an increasingly important role, but for
now, a balanced approach that combines human expertise with targeted automation may be the
most effective way to drive progress in quantum manufacturing.

## Collaborative Manufacturing Approach: Implementing a shared production model with common tools

Establishing a greenfield quantum foundry is a complex and costly endeavour, requiring
significant investments in equipment and infrastructure. While the wafer volumes required for
quantum manufacturing are relatively small compared to traditional semiconductor production,
they still pose a substantial challenge. However, it's essential to consider the development
timeframe for such a venture. With the new Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) set to
begin in 2028, it's crucial to initiate investments as soon as possible to ensure timely
development and deployment of quantum foundries. In this context, repurposing an existing
foundry could be a viable and realistic option within the given timeframe, allowing for the
refinement of processes and production of viable products.
In the long term, establishing large-scale foundries will be crucial for achieving efficient
economies of scale and high utilization rates, ultimately driving the commercial production of
quantum chips. To address this, a foundry-style approach can be effective, where production
tools are shared among multiple start-ups in a dedicated clean-room facility. This can help
accelerate the production of superconducting quantum processors, while minimizing
contamination risks and optimizing usage rates.

## 2026 Strategic Plan and Alignment with Chips Act 2.0: Outlining a coordinated roadmap for the future

The Quantum Chips Industrialization Roadmap, to be delivered in 2026, should prioritize
specific funding and scale-up support for European quantum chip developers. As quantum
computing technologies become more mature and scalable, explicit funding and settlement
programs for innovative chip factories that specialize in quantum chips will be required to
support private quantum chip lines. The Quantum Chips Industrialization Roadmap should be
closely coordinated with the forthcoming Chips Act 2.0, to ensure that both instruments support
the growth of European quantum chip companies.

## Intellectual Property and Production Guidelines: Defining rules for innovation and scaling up production

The quantum sector faces unique challenges due to its market composition, which is dominated
by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the early stages of production. Additionally,
the rapid evolution of processes in this field poses significant challenges. Clear IP ownership

is essential for both startups and foundries, as it often serves as a prerequisite for securing
investment and driving growth. In an industry where processes and designs are constantly
evolving and converging, it is vital to establish unambiguous IP ownership at all stages of
development. This means that startups should have a clear pathway to maintain control over
their proprietary technologies, and the distribution of process and design IP should be welldefined. By providing clarity on IP ownership, companies can confidently transfer validated
processes to private foundries as the market matures, enabling them to scale production while
focusing on their core business activities, whereas foundries can ensure a stable and reliable
supply chain.

## Packaging and Integration: Identifying areas where Europe can take the lead

Already today, quantum processing units (QPUs) are typically built with 3D-integrated
solutions including multi-chip stacks and dedicated 3D-integration solutions, and for example
in superconducting QPUs it is foreseen that the scaling is largely enabled by suitable backend
fabrication and integration solutions. Scaling towards further-generation QPUs will require
developing new techniques and scaling the backend processing techniques to the next level.
One potential opportunity for Europe lies in developing methods, tools, and capacities towards
this end.
As European industry seeks to develop and establish itself in the quantum sector, it can pioneer
new solutions and innovate new ways of developing methodology, tools and capacity to enable
this. The need for advanced packaging technologies, such as 3D flip-chip solutions, is not
unique to quantum computing, and other electronics manufacturers may also be interested in
these technologies: the quantum technology needs new state-of-the-art packaging technologies
to be able to precisely test, package, and assemble the final quantum processors. This back-end
technology to be developed can also be used in other areas in advanced electronics or in
MEMS, or in another words, it is not only limited to quantum technology.
This creates a potential market opportunity for European companies to develop and supply
these solutions. Furthermore, the complexity of packaging solutions for quantum systems could
play to Europe's advantage, as the region has the chance to establish itself as a leader in this
area. While we have made significant progress in developing qubits, the development of
packaging technology will ultimately determine which regions and companies can successfully
create large-scale quantum systems that meet the required material and quality standards.

## Mitigating Supply Chain Risks and Bottlenecks: Addressing potential dependencies

The development of quantum technology relies on a range of critical materials, including
niobium, tantalum, aluminum, and titanium for superconducting qubits. However, the supply
chain for these materials is often limited and vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions. For
example, exotic compounds like lithium niobate are typically produced in Japan, while helium3, essential for dilution refrigerators, is primarily sourced from tritium decay in nuclear
[weapons programs and rare natural deposits. A supply chain analysis by Nato](https://www.fheijman.nl/QSC_report.pdf) found that over
90% of high-purity material processing occurs outside of allied territories, leaving
superconducting qubit fabrication vulnerable to external dependencies.
