feedback: 'As an academic and research institution, we provide the training and collaboration
  necessary for basic and applied research projects, working alongside small and medium-sized
  enterprises. Our sustained work in this area enables us to develop innovations in
  cross-cutting tasks in sectors such as health, the environment and communications,
  where the integration of different types of technology is fundamental. This is possible
  thanks to the continuous provision of the necessary resources in terms of EDA tools,
  access to manufacturing technologies and training in the various editions of EUROCHIP/EUROPRACTICE.
  This initiative provides access to both mature and advanced technologies, which
  support the integration of very low-power circuits, for example. We believe it is
  necessary to increase the critical mass of trained professionals in the sector.
  To this end, capacities and resources must be increased in different areas of action:
  a. Deepening training in fundamental technological aspects to cover technological
  advances; b. Increasing training in the design of highly integrated digital systems
  without losing sight of environmental criteria. c. Provide access to manufacturing
  facilities with the flexibility to handle small runs, which are typical of teaching
  and R&D projects, at an affordable cost. The CHIP Act promotes key aspects of technological
  sovereignty, particularly securing substantial investment in the sector in collaboration
  with companies. However, we believe that a shortage of trained personnel could hinder
  the securing of the necessary resources. This training must provide a systemic vision
  to facilitate permeability between traditionally isolated sectors. In order to promote
  competitiveness, the integration of new paradigms into microelectronic design methods
  must be considered. In this context, universities and their research groups could
  play a significant role if they receive adequate funding.'
