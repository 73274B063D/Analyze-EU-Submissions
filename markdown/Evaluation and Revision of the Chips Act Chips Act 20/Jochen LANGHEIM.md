feedback: '1. Semiconductor industry needs investments to stay in the game.They are
  today the base of our wealth and liberty. Investments mean public funding but also
  private funding. Private investors need to have confidence in the payback of their
  investments, in a convincing business case and an overall strategy. That is missing
  in Europe at the moment. 2. Chips Act 1.0 has adressed technologies and components,
  maybe subsystems. But this approach has reached its limits. In the definition of
  strategic roadmaps, final customers are very rarely involved. This is different
  in China. We here in Europe need to take China as the example for strategic thinking
  and copy the right measure, e.g. the creation of an IP portal for RISC-V IP. The
  next Chips Act must take into account the final markets. A cross industry initiative
  like the KET initiative must bring together the semiconductor industry AND their
  customers and define together the right measures to strengthen the full supply chain
  up to the automotive, aerospace pharmaceutical or industrial final customer, create
  synergies, but also committment from the customers. A gap analysis needs to be performed
  to make sure the customers get what they need. We have seen this in individual cases
  that the partnership between a semiconductor company and a final customer creates
  the difference. 3. We must be conscious that a revolution is ongoing. There is no
  longer the opinion of the experts explaining that something is not feasible, but
  today the game changers fix a (sometimes unthinkable) target and the experts have
  to find a way to get there. The process is very strongly moving from a technology
  push to a user pull. It thus also needs a progressive and strong governance that
  can lead this revolution. 4. Another point is the separation between military and
  civil research. This needs to be abandonned. Very valuable innovations have been
  created very often in the military area to then move into civil applications. Europe
  needs to profit from it like we see it in the USA or Israel. 5. There is a need
  to create an environment of rules that allow european industry to work tighter together
  to win markets together. The competition is not inside Europe, but between Europe,
  the US and China. The competition law needs to reflect this new situation and allow
  e.g. the implementation of collaboration projects with much more agility.(less administration)
  6. Protect your inventions and standardise them. Every R&D project talks about it,
  but in the realisation it is very inefficient. There needs to be a specific focus
  on IP and standards. 6. Despite the political and commercial pressure, we must not
  forget the planet, the climate, the resources and the people. In developping new
  technologies, we must make sure that everyone understands and accepts the new developments.
  If we loose the link to parts of the population, we will put the environment in
  danger. Conclusion: This all calls for a stronger Chips Act that improves the shortcomings
  of the first one.'

### **SiC & GaN Powder sources inl. recycling**


- 70% of all global e-waste ends up in the China


- China sources almost 100 % of its SiC in China


- GaN considered strategic in « Third generation

semiconductor » initiative


- Companies like Sanan or Tianyue receive direct

support from central and local government


- GaN industry all over China


- Europe needs to become specialist in recycling






### **Sanan**






### **SiC Wafer Suppliers**

##### • SICC • https://www.sicc.cc/en • TANKBLUE • https://en.tankeblue.com/ • CETC 46 (military) • EPI World • Hebei Synlight • Further info: • https://www.xkh-semitech.com/






### **GaN**


- Cooperation Innoscience – ST (4/25)

  - Common development


- 1100 employees

- Products up to 1200 V available

- Normally off (e-mode)

- Lawsuit against EPC won

- Lawsuit against Infineon ongoing






### **China Subsidies**






### **Semiconductor investments in the world**

**Europe Chips Act**


Leverage 43 bn€


.. ASML
.. ST
.. Infineon
.. ESMC
.. Intel
.. BOSCH
.. CEA, IMEC, FHG
...






### **V2G in China**


- V2G charging identified as important technology in 2024 to promote renewable

energies and benefit from EV fleet


- Launch of pilot projects on V2G in 9 cities + Beijing

(Shanghai, Shenzhen, Changzhou, Hefei, Huaibei, Guangzhou, Haikou, Chongqing, Kunming)


- Business case(s) are not clear due to fragmentation of contractual environments


- Interconnection between regions a challenge


- Stationary chargers need upgrades to be V2G compatible (costly)


- Europe and US slightly ahead in terms of development


➔ **Chinese market offers opportunities**






### **Standards**


- Regulations are key (not a pain)

- Support of China 2025 & “Standards 2035” strategy

   - Independence of China

   - Dominance of the world

- National and international standardization participation

- National: little preparation time can be observed

- Examples:



South China Morning Post






- Test protocols

- Specific certificates (CCC, SELO) needed to be allowed to enter market

- Company standards for SiC modules at BYD, CRRC, State Grid; only local suppliers with correct dimensions
and tolerances allowed

- EV Batteries must not burn (from July 1 [st] 2026 onwards)
**= technocracy hurdle**


### **ARCHIMEDES example**


- Topic: mobility & power electronics


- Issue: new technologies AND new use cases


  - bidirectionnal chargers for EVs with GaN or SiC


  - Incoming inspection of components:


     - How & what to test ?


     - How to optimise components for use cases in different markets ?


  - Car: standard quality + extended lifetime + new architectures


  - Plane: standard quality + high altitude + new architectures


- Solution: cooperation throughout supply chain including specialized R&D labs (50 partners)


- Dissemination e.g. through link to SEMI Europe and in further workshops


### **Conclusion**


- Industry is dramatically changing


- Semiconductors and software are crucial for automotive in the next years


- Value share of semiconductors and software e.g. in cars will reach 30 % of the car value


- Development of semiconductors is expensive and needs markets for amortisation


- **US and China** are investing heavily into the race as technology


- Huge investments create overcapacities, competition in China and ultimately also in Europe / price pressure


- Ferocious competition in China


    - Consolidation expected in China


    - Competition will swap over to Europe


- China has key industries to amortise
(automotive, communication, energy transition)


- Europe has not enough industry wide strategic exchange (like KET initiative)






### **Recommendations**


- Make sure everyone understands the


  - Challenge of semiconductors and software in cars


  - Mechanisms of costs and amortisation


  - The industrial revolution driven by China and by Tech Giants


- European Industries need to cooperate stronger cross value chain to share costs, develop

markets and common resilience


- EU rules must allow response to w/w market pressure


- Look deeply into China and copy best practices


- Abandon separation in Europe between military and civil R&D


- More strategic cooperation / consolidation between European companies needed
