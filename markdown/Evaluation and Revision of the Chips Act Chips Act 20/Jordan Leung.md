feedback: Europes semiconductor ecosystem remains constrained by limited design access,
  fragmented state-aid procedures, workforce shortages, and the absence of sustainability-aligned
  incentives. While the 2023 Chips Act was an essential foundation, its implementation
  has shown structural gaps. SMEs and universities still lack affordable access to
  design tools, IP libraries, and pilot lines; permitting for semiconductor projects
  remains inconsistent and slow across Member States; new facilities face talent shortages;
  and environmental considerations remain insufficiently integrated. As a result,
  Europe risks missing its goal of strengthening resilience and competitiveness across
  the semiconductor value chain. A revised Chips Act 2.0 should shift focus from manufacturing
  volume toward ecosystem capacity. I propose a framework built around four pillars.
  First, the Act should establish an EU Open Chip Platform providing open-source EDA
  tools, shared IP blocks, and accessible pilot-line capacity. Reserving a share of
  public pilot-line time for SMEs and research institutions would broaden participation
  and unlock innovation beyond large incumbents. Second, a unified EU coordination
  portal should streamline state-aid approvals, environmental permitting, and grid-access
  processes. Introducing binding timelines and transparent dashboards would reduce
  delays that currently discourage private investment. Third, the Act should create
  a talent-mobility and workforce program including semiconductor-specific vocational
  pathways, a harmonized curriculum, and facilitated mobility for engineers across
  Member States. Without a skilled workforce, new R&D capacity and fabrication facilities
  cannot operate at scale. Fourth, sustainability-linked incentives should be incorporated
  by tying state-aid intensity to low-carbon energy use and resource-efficient production.
  Aligning semiconductor expansion with the European Green Deal strengthens Europes
  long-term competitiveness and attracts companies seeking low-carbon supply chains.
  These four pillars directly address the shortcomings of Chips Act 1.0. Open design
  access resolves the current concentration of design capability among a few large
  firms. A unified coordination portal removes fragmentation that delayed several
  major investment projects. Workforce programs mitigate the talent shortages that
  have limited operational readiness. Sustainability incentives ensure that semiconductor
  scaling is environmentally and economically viable in Europes regulatory context.
  Together, these reforms transform the Chips Act from a fabrication-centric intervention
  into a coherent ecosystem strategy. Concerns about centralization, cost, or competitiveness
  can be mitigated. The proposed coordination portal preserves Member State authority
  while simplifying procedures. Open-source design tools complement, not replace,
  proprietary systems. Sustainability incentives reward efficient production rather
  than impose burdens. And allocating a portion of pilot-line access to SMEs enables
  innovation without restricting industrial deployment. Chips Act 2.0 can therefore
  enhance Europes semiconductor resilience, broaden participation, and ensure that
  public investment delivers long-term strategic benefit.

# ​Rebalancing Europe’s Semiconductor Strategy: Building an Inclusive​ ​and Sustainable Ecosystem Under the Chips Act 2.0​

## **​Introduction​**


​The European Union’s semiconductor strategy stands at a critical inflection point. While the​ _​European​_
_​Chips Act​_ ​of 2023 (Regulation (EU) 2023/1781) successfully​​placed semiconductors at the heart of​
​Europe’s industrial policy, the Act remains incomplete in scope and ambition. Europe continues to hold​
​less than 10 percent of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity, far from its 2030 target of 20​
​percent. More importantly, Europe’s position in design, advanced packaging, and AI-accelerator segments​
​remains structurally weak. The result is an ecosystem that depends heavily on non-European supply​
​chains for strategic technologies.​


​This paper proposes a targeted policy revision —​ _​Chips​​Act 2.0​_ ​— focused on inclusivity, open design​
​infrastructure, and sustainability. The next phase of the Act should democratize access to semiconductor​
​design and manufacturing by expanding open-source design platforms, shared pilot lines, and workforce​
​development programs. It should also establish a unified EU-level “front-door” for state-aid and​
​permitting, enabling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and research institutions to access​
​support that currently favors large corporations. Strategically, Europe should invest in sectors where it is​
​already indispensable — power electronics, sensors, and lithography — and link these to sustainable,​
​low-carbon production.​


​By broadening participation and simplifying governance,​ _​Chips Act 2.0​_ ​can transform Europe’s​
​semiconductor policy from a reactive industrial intervention into a sustainable ecosystem strategy.​

## **​II. Legal / Regulatory / Policy Background​**


​The​ _​European Chips Act​_ ​(Regulation (EU) 2023/1781) created a three-pillar framework to strengthen​
​Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem:​


​1.​ **​Chips for Europe Initiative:​** ​EU and national funding​​for pilot lines, design platforms, and​

​competence centers.​


​2.​ **​Security of Supply and Resilience:​** ​Fast-track permitting and state-aid exemptions for​

​“first-of-a-kind” semiconductor facilities.​


​3.​ **​Monitoring and Crisis Response Mechanism:​** ​Early-warning​​systems and joint procurement​

​under the European Semiconductor Board.​


​While the Act established a solid institutional foundation, implementation challenges remain. First,​
**​fragmentation​** ​persists across national and EU funding​​programs (​ _Horizon Europe​_,​ _​Digital Europe​_
_​Programme​_, and​ _​IPCEI on Microelectronics​_ ), creating​​overlapping procedures and inconsistent eligibility​
​rules. Second,​ **​state-aid flexibility​** ​benefits mainly​​large firms with the capacity to navigate complex legal​
​frameworks. SMEs and academic institutions continue to face barriers to entry. Third,​ **​evaluation​**
**​mechanisms​** ​focus narrowly on wafer-fabrication capacity​​rather than ecosystem health (e.g., design​
​output, talent mobility, or sustainability metrics).​


​In September 2025, all 27 Member States signed the​ _​Semicon Coalition Declaration​_ ​calling for an​
​enhanced​ _​Chips Act 2.0​_ . This declaration emphasizes​​five pillars: (1) secured EU budget line, (2)​
​simplified state-aid and permitting, (3) expansion into design & packaging, (4) skills development, and​
​(5) sustainability integration. The European Commission’s concurrent​ _​Call for Evidence​_ ​invites​
​stakeholders to evaluate the 2023 Act’s effectiveness.​


​In short, the existing framework creates a legal platform but lacks the procedural speed and inclusivity​
​necessary to achieve its goals.​ _​Chips Act 2.0​_ ​must​​therefore refine both​ **​governance​** ​(through unified​
​coordination) and​ **​substance​** ​(through broadened eligibility​​and sustainable objectives).​

## **​III. Technical Background​**


​Semiconductor development involves a multistage process — design, fabrication, assembly, testing, and​
​packaging — each with distinct technical and economic constraints. Understanding these realities clarifies​
​why Europe must pursue an ecosystem-oriented approach.​


​1.​ **​Design Layer.​** ​Modern chips are designed using complex​​electronic-design-automation (EDA)​

​tools that cost millions annually to license. This excludes universities and startups from​
​innovation unless subsidized or open-sourced.​


​2.​ **​Fabrication (Fabs).​** ​Advanced fabrication nodes (<10​​nm) require >€15 billion per plant and​

​global supply chains for photolithography and materials. Europe’s ASML dominates EUV​
​lithography but lacks local customers using it.​


​3.​ **​Packaging and Testing.​** ​Post-fab assembly and advanced​​packaging (e.g., 3D stacking for AI​

​chips) have become new bottlenecks in the global chain. Europe’s capacity is limited yet vital for​
​AI accelerator markets.​


​4.​ **​Talent and Infrastructure.​** ​Semiconductor production is energy- and water-intensive, requiring​

​stable grids and skilled technicians. Europe’s energy costs and workforce shortages create​
​non-technical barriers to expansion.​


​5.​ **​Sustainability.​** ​As the European Green Deal becomes​​a cross-sector mandate, chipmakers must​

​lower carbon emissions and resource consumption. Policies that tie sustainability targets to​
​industrial incentives could differentiate Europe globally.​


​Technically, these realities show that​ **​scaling only​​fabrication capacity​** ​will not make Europe​
​competitive. A resilient ecosystem depends on​ **​design​​access​**,​ **​workforce depth​**, and​ **​green​**
**​manufacturing capacity​** ​— the areas where policy intervention​​can be most effective.​

## **​IV. Proposal: The Chips Act 2.0 Framework​**


​The proposed​ _​Chips Act 2.0​_ ​builds upon Regulation​​(EU) 2023/1781 but re-balances priorities from​
_​production volume​_ ​toward​ _​ecosystem capacity​_ . It introduces​​four interlocking pillars:​

## **​A. Open Design and R&D Infrastructure​**


​●​ ​Establish an​ **​EU Open Chip Platform​** ​— a federated network​​of open-source EDA tools, shared​

​IP libraries, and simulation environments hosted by existing competence centers.​


​●​ ​Fund shared​ _​pilot lines​_ ​through the​ _​Chips for Europe​​Initiative​_ ​for GaN power electronics,​

​sensors, and AI accelerators.​


​●​ ​Require that all publicly funded pilot facilities reserve at least 30% of capacity for SMEs,​

​startups, and academic partners.​


_​Legal Fit:​_ ​Implemented under Article 7 (Chips for​​Europe Initiative) via delegated regulation extending​
​eligibility to SMEs and academic consortia.​

## **​B. Unified EU Coordination Portal​**


​●​ ​Create a single​ **​“front-door”​** ​under the European Semiconductor​​Board integrating state-aid​

​approvals, permitting, and grid access.​


​●​ ​Introduce binding​ **​timelines​** ​(e.g., six months) for​​state-aid decisions on strategic semiconductor​

​projects.​


​●​ ​Publish transparent dashboards of funded projects to enhance accountability.​


_​Legal Fit:​_ ​Amend Article 8 to authorize the Board to coordinate Member-State procedures and issue​
​binding timelines.​

## **​C. Workforce and Mobility Program​**


​●​ ​Establish​ **​Semiconductor Talent Mobility Visas​** ​for​​intra-EU engineers and technicians.​


​●​ ​Fund vocational centers co-located with pilot lines.​


​●​ ​Align university curricula under a unified​ _​Semiconductor​​Education Framework​_ .​


_​Legal Fit:​_ ​New Article 11a linking Chips Act to Erasmus+​​and the European Education Area.​

## **​D. Sustainable Manufacturing Incentives​**


​●​ ​Tie state-aid intensity to​ _​carbon-intensity benchmarks​_ ​and​ _​renewable-energy sourcing​_ .​


​●​ ​Provide​ _​Green Fab Grants​_ ​for water recycling, energy​​storage, and waste-heat reuse.​


​●​ ​Include sustainability metrics in the EU’s semiconductor monitoring reports.​


_​Legal Fit:​_ ​Integrate with Article 14 (Reporting and Evaluation) to include environmental performance​
​indicators.​


​Collectively, these pillars create an ecosystem where participation is broadened, innovation is accelerated,​
​and sustainability is embedded into industrial strategy.​ _​Chips Act 2.0​_ ​thereby shifts focus from​ **​strategic​**
**​autonomy by volume​** ​to​ **​strategic indispensability through capability.​**

## **​How Chips Act 2.0 Resolves the Structural Limitations of Chips Act 1.0​**


​This proposal directly addresses the shortcomings revealed during the implementation of Chips Act 1.0.​
​The original Act created an important foundation, but it did not sufficiently extend design infrastructure​
​or R&D access to smaller innovators. Large firms benefited from pilot lines and design platforms, while​
​SMEs, universities, and startups struggled with high EDA licensing costs and limited access to fabrication​
​resources. By establishing an EU Open Chip Platform—anchored in open-source design tools, shared IP​
​libraries, and accessible pilot lines—Chips Act 2.0 transforms these bottlenecks into enablers. This lowers​
​barriers to entry, expands Europe’s innovation pipeline, and ensures that the benefits of public funding​
​reach a broader set of actors than under the initial Act.​


​Fragmentation and procedural delays also limited Chips Act 1.0’s effectiveness. State-aid approvals​
​stretched into months or years, permitting processes varied dramatically across Member States, and there​
​was no single authority ensuring deadline compliance. Investor hesitation and delayed projects, such as​
​the Wolfspeed fab timeline reported by Reuters [14], demonstrate that uncertainty is itself a​
​competitiveness issue. The proposed unified EU coordination portal directly resolves this challenge.​
​Centralizing applications and introducing enforceable decision timelines creates predictability—the single​
​most requested feature from industry during stakeholder consultations. This addresses the core​
​administrative inefficiency that the original Act could not overcome.​


​Chips Act 1.0 also fell short on workforce development. Despite new R&D programs and planned​
​fabrication facilities, Europe lacks sufficient semiconductor engineers, equipment technicians, materials​
​specialists, and packaging experts. Without talent, capital investment remains inert. The Chips Act 2.0​


​workforce and mobility program responds by building an EU-wide talent pipeline, aligning educational​
​curricula, and enabling cross-border mobility for semiconductor professionals. This ensures that new pilot​
​lines, design centers, and fabs—funded through public investment—are staffed by the skilled workforce​
​necessary to operate them.​


​Finally, the first Act paid little attention to sustainability. Semiconductor production is highly​
​energy-intensive, and Europe’s high energy costs and environmental constraints shape site-selection​
​decisions as much as subsidies do. By linking state-aid intensity to carbon benchmarks and​
​renewable-energy sourcing, Chips Act 2.0 ensures that public money accelerates Europe’s transition to​
​low-carbon manufacturing rather than working against it. These incentives transform a potential​
​liability—Europe’s strict environmental standards—into a strategic differentiator for global firms seeking​
​low-carbon supply chains.​


​Taken together, these four pillars provide targeted solutions to each major limitation identified in Chips​
​Act 1.0: limited access, slow execution, talent shortages, and sustainability blind spots. Chips Act 2.0​
​evolves the EU’s semiconductor strategy from a narrow focus on fabrication volume into a holistic​
​ecosystem approach capable of delivering long-term competitiveness and technological sovereignty.​


**​Anticipated Concerns and Responses:​**
​Some may argue that these reforms risk increasing administrative complexity, weakening Member State​
​autonomy, or imposing sustainability burdens on industry. However, each proposed pillar is designed to​
​streamline existing frameworks, broaden participation without reducing competitiveness, and align​
​industry incentives with long-term strategic goals. Open design infrastructure complements—rather than​
​replaces—proprietary systems. A unified coordination portal strengthens national tools by reducing​
​delays. Sustainability-linked incentives match global corporate trends toward cleaner production. And​
​guaranteed SME access to pilot lines supports innovation without impeding industrial deployment. Far​
​from introducing tradeoffs, this package of measures resolves competing inefficiencies and positions​
​Europe for durable, ecosystem-level semiconductor leadership.​

## **​V. Conclusion​**


​Europe’s semiconductor ambitions cannot succeed through fabrication subsidies alone. The​ _​Chips Act​_
_​2023​_ ​was a crucial foundation, but execution gaps​​in accessibility, speed, and ecosystem breadth threaten​
​its effectiveness.​


​The proposed​ _​Chips Act 2.0​_ ​addresses these issues by opening design access, unifying coordination,​
​investing in workforce development, and embedding sustainability. If adopted, it would produce a​
​semiconductor ecosystem defined by integration, resilience, and innovation — not dependency.​


​Implementation should proceed via Commission delegated regulations and amendments under Articles 7,​
​8, and 14 of Regulation 2023/1781, in close partnership with Member States and the Semicon Coalition.​
​With coherent governance and ecosystem-level investment, Europe can transform semiconductor​
​vulnerability into strategic strength.​
