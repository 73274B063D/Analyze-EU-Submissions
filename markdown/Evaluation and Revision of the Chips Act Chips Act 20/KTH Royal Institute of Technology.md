EU Chips Act 2



Ref. Ares(2025)10452575 - 28/11/2025


# **KTH Response to the European Commission** **Call for Evidence for the Revision of the EU** **Chips Act (Chips Act 2)**

Position dated November 2025.


Since its founding in 1827, KTH Royal Institute of Technology has grown into a leading international
technical university. As Sweden’s largest institution for technical education and research, KTH brings
together students, researchers, and educators from around the world. Rooted in a strong tradition of
advancing science and innovation, our work is dedicated to fostering sustainable societal development.


KTH strongly supports the European Commission’s strategic initiative to strengthen Europe’s
semiconductor ecosystem. Semiconductors power technologies that define future competitiveness,
innovation, and resilience, including applications in AI, automotive, defence, quantum technologies,
HPC, and energy. We welcome the Commission’s recognition of the strategic importance of
semiconductors for Europe’s global competitiveness and digital sovereignty, and we support bold and
forward-looking initiatives such as the EU Chips Act and the proposed Chips Act 2.0.


**Strategic Context**


Europe currently produces a relatively small share of global semiconductor output and lacks highvolume manufacturing capacity for sub-10 nm nodes. This dependency on non-EU actors constitutes a
strategic vulnerability, particularly in sectors critical for defence, security, automotive, quantum
technologies, and HPC.


However, this challenge is not solely one of technical capability. Europe lacks a single customer or
sector with sufficient, stable demand to justify the construction of full-scale leading-edge fabs. Demand
is fragmented across industries, and volumes fluctuate over time. To overcome this, industrial
coordination is required — for instance, pooling semiconductor demand across the automotive industry
or other medium-volume strategic sectors. Without this coordinated demand, even advanced European
fabs may struggle to achieve sustainable operation.


**Capacity Building and Frontier Research**


Addressing Europe’s strategic dependencies requires a long-term approach that combines pilot
production, innovation, and research. Flexible, modular manufacturing facilities, including pilot lines
and first-of-a-kind fabs, are essential to serve as technology testbeds for emerging applications.


Sustained investment in low-TRL (Technology Readiness Level) research is critical to ensure Europe
remains globally competitive. This includes research in foundational areas such as chip design,
materials science, and photonics, as well as applied domains including heterogeneous integration,
advanced packaging, and power electronics. As KTH has previously highlighted as an input to the [MFF-](https://www.stockholmtrio.org/brusselsrepresentation/stockholmtrioeupolicycontributions.4.7e64877b1926afdc09931d4.html)

[consultation, together with the University Alliance Stockholm Trio (Karolinska Institutet, KTH and](https://www.stockholmtrio.org/brusselsrepresentation/stockholmtrioeupolicycontributions.4.7e64877b1926afdc09931d4.html)
Stockholm University, and as other academic and research organizations have emphasized, Horizon
Europe should support low-TRL Research Actions in strategic areas— for example, through targeted
funding calls, collaborative research networks, and pilot projects — to drive long-term innovation
across strategic sectors. Such initiatives are essential to advance emerging technologies in AI, HPC,
quantum technologies, and other areas critical to Europe’s technological sovereignty.


Overcoming disciplinary silos between physics, electronics, and materials science is key to unlocking
semiconductor innovations critical for strategic sectors such as quantum technologies, highperformance computing, and space systems, ensuring Europe maintains a leading role in frontier
research. Semiconductors are foundational to multiple domains — from quantum computing and
communication to energy, automotive, and defence applications. Developing advanced semiconductor
materials, for example silicon carbide and other emerging materials in which Sweden has strong
expertise. Funding and research structures should encourage cross-sectoral collaboration, enabling
breakthroughs that span multiple technologies and applications critical to Europe’s chip ecosystem.


**Strengthening Europe’s Position in Essential Semiconductor Technologies**


While leading-edge nodes attract global attention, Europe also holds competitive strengths in essential
semiconductors such as power electronics, sensors, photonics, and microcontrollers. Preserving and
enhancing this leadership requires long-term, stable funding for research and innovation, including
multi-year programs that allow ambitious projects to reach maturity. Equally important is the
establishment of dedicated research infrastructures—that support the translation of research from lab
to industry.


Robust academic-industry collaboration is critical to maximize the impact of investments, ensure
hands-on training for students and researchers, and accelerate technology transfer. The Framework
Programme, Horizon Europe, is in this respect a very important instrument supporting pre-competitive
collaboration between academia and industry. This should be complemented by joint programming
and strategic roadmapping at the European level to coordinate priorities, avoid duplication, and
leverage resources efficiently. Cross-border collaboration, open-access facilities, and shared innovation
ecosystems will strengthen Europe’s position in essential technologies and prepare for future
semiconductor challenges, including emerging materials, system integration, AI-optimized chips, and
quantum-enabled devices.


**Workforce Development and Skills**


Europe faces a substantial workforce gap in semiconductor technologies, with estimates indicating the
need for approximately 75,000 skilled professionals across academia, industry, and public institutions
[by 2030 (European Chips Skills Academy, 2024). Recent ECSA reports highlight a structural shortage:](https://pact-for-skills.ec.europa.eu/community-resources/publications-and-documents/ecsa-skills-strategy-2024_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
around 30% of current skilled staff are expected to retire by 2030, while graduate inflow grows at less
than 1% per year, potentially creating an annual shortfall of ~10,800 professionals across design,
[manufacturing, testing, and emerging roles such as AI-hardware design and cybersecurity (European](https://chipsacademy.eu/news/ecsa-skills-strategy-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
[Chips Skills Academy, 2025).](https://chipsacademy.eu/news/ecsa-skills-strategy-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)


Addressing this gap requires a coordinated approach to education, training, and lifelong learning. KTH
advocates expanding undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education programs in semiconductor
technologies, alongside initiatives such as the European Chips Academy, coordinated PhD schools, and
programs leveraging MSCA, Erasmus+, and Lifelong Learning frameworks. Partnerships with industry
are essential to provide hands-on experience, internships, and applied research opportunities.

Programs aimed at attracting and retaining top researchers and engineers within Europe will ensure
that Europe remains competitive in both research and industrial production.


**Cross-Cutting Considerations**


Europe’s semiconductor strategy must also address broader considerations beyond capacity and
demand. Long-term funding stability is crucial, protecting frontier research from market or political
fluctuations. Sustainability should be embedded in production and materials innovation, promoting
energy-efficient, circular approaches to manufacturing.


KTH’s ongoing involvement in EU Chips JU and the Swedish Chips Competence Centre (SCCC)
illustrates how semiconductor investments can contribute to wider ecosystem resilience. Through
SCCC’s coordinated national framework for skills, infrastructure access, and SME support, KTH
demonstrates how academic actors can strengthen regional innovation capacity, enable participation
by SMEs and deep-tech startups, and link research infrastructures to industrial needs. Such initiatives
show that cross-cutting semiconductor policy must incorporate not only leading-edge research, but also
ecosystem-wide accessibility—ensuring that startups, scale-ups, and smaller companies can utilize
advanced infrastructure, pilot lines, and training resources.


Security and dual-use considerations must be balanced with academic freedom and international
collaboration. Universities should be able to engage globally while adhering to clear guidance on
security, foreign interference, and dual-use compliance. International partnerships with like-minded
actors can accelerate innovation while safeguarding European technological sovereignty.


**Conclusion**


KTH strongly supports the European Commission’s bold vision for the EU semiconductor ecosystem.
Achieving technological sovereignty requires more than building capacity; it requires coordinated
industrial demand, long-term investment in frontier research, robust research infrastructure, and the
development of a highly skilled workforce. By integrating these elements, Europe can reduce
dependency on non-EU actors, foster innovation across critical sectors, and secure a leading position in
the global semiconductor landscape.


Building on this commitment, KTH contributes to the EU’s semiconductor strategy through practical,
operational actions: offering access to cutting-edge research facilities, participating in pilot-line
development, expanding semiconductor education and skills programmes, and collaborating closely
with industry and SMEs. These efforts help ensure that Europe’s semiconductor ambitions translate
into real technological capability, competitiveness, and long-term resilience.
