feedback: 'Kalray welcomes the European Commissions initiative to revise the Chips
  Act. Adopted in September 2023 to address semiconductor shortages, the Chips Act
  must now evolve to reflect a transformed market, rapid technological shifts, and
  new geopolitical realities. While the ambition to secure a 20% EU market share by
  2030 is both commendable and necessary, the current framework could better support
  the key players best positioned to realize it: fabless innovators like Kalray, which
  have been at the forefront of the AI chip domaina segment critical to meeting Europes
  targets. Our experience highlights some of the challenges in this endeavor. As an
  early and active contributor to policy discussions, we have engaged constructively
  with European and national decision-makers, yet we have encountered structural obstacles:
  Exclusion from the IPCEIs Sense Pilar on Microelectronics despite our strategic
  alignment, with limited transparency in the criteria underlying the selection decisions.
  A misalignment with the EIC, where our roadmap, focused on cutting-edge AI hardware,
  was not fully recognized as a ''priority'' or ''strategic'' initiative, which seems
  inconsistent with the EUs broader objectives. Ongoing hurdles in fundraising, as
  venture capital remains cautious about scaling deep-tech companies, and public funding
  has traditionally favored traditional fabs on mature nodes, which may not fully
  align with emerging market needs like AI. Complexities in the allocation process
  for EU funds, where navigating administrative requirements can sometimes overshadow
  core business priorities. These challenges reveal a significant gap between the
  Chips Acts ambitious goals and the practical support needed to achieve themespecially
  for the fabless and design ecosystems that are critical to Europes competitiveness
  in advanced semiconductor technologies. Yet, these innovatorswho will drive demand
  for cutting-edge nodes and then attract major manufacturers like TSMC, Intel, or
  Samsunghave received disproportionately little attention compared to traditional
  semiconductor factories. Europes capacity for advanced FinFET nodes (5nm and beyond)
  remains underdeveloped, and fostering their customer ecosystem is crucial to changing
  this dynamic. Fabless companies like Kalray, with their agile, innovation-driven
  models, represent one of Europes strongest assets for reducing dependencies, diversifying
  supply chains, and capturing high-growth opportunities. With enhanced support, they
  can fully contribute to Europes semiconductor sovereignty. This contribution aims
  to propose actionable recommendations to better integrate fabless ecosystems into
  a revised framework, ensuring the Chips Acts success. Recommendation 1: Formally
  recognize fabless companies as the cornerstone of a sovereign semiconductor ecosystem,
  with policies tailored to their distinct needs across the value chain. Recommendation
  2: Provide targeted R&D supportthrough subsidies, tax incentives, or matched fundingto
  European fabless companies, particularly innovative SMEs, enabling them to develop
  sovereign design capabilities and secure a greater share of the value chain, in
  line with the Draghi reports recommendations. Recommendation 3 (inspired by the
  Draghi report and aligned with Eurostack): Establish procurement preferences for
  EU-produced chips in public data centers and HPC infrastructures, ensuring that
  public investments translate into sustainable market opportunities for European
  companies and reinforce the continents strategic autonomy in AI hardware. Recommendation
  4: Launch an IPCEI dedicated to chiplet technologies, with a dual focus on: 1. Creating
  a European chiplet ecosystemincluding standardized interfaces, shared design tools,
  and a network of trusted assembly partnersto enable fabless companies to compete
  in global markets. 2. Tying public funding to measurable collaboration metrics,
  such as joint patents, shared roadmaps, or consortia-based projects'
