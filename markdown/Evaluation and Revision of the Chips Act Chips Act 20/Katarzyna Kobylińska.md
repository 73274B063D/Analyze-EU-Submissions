feedback: We need the Chip Act to protect European semiconductor production, but it
  cannot be that the proposal contains not a single word about printed circuit boards,
  without which the whole undertaking makes no sense. EU legislation should also cover
  (and protect) this area, as it is directly related to our security and determines
  the greater or lesser dependence of the EU on third countries.
