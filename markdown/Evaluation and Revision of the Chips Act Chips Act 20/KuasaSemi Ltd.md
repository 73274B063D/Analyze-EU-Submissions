feedback: 'KuasaSemi is a UK-based deep tech startup developing TCAD software for
  wide bandgap (WBG) power semiconductor design. Headquartered in Wales, UK, we are
  committed to enabling accessible, intuitive simulation tools for SMEs, researchers,
  and scale-ups working on SiC and GaN technologies. We strongly support the inclusion
  of power semiconductors and WBG technologies as core pillars of the next European
  Chips Act. These technologies are essential for electrification, energy efficiency,
  and net-zero goals. We also urge the Commission to: 1. Recognize the importance
  of design software and simulation tools (like TCAD) in enabling innovation across
  the value chain 2. Ensure SMEs and startups can access infrastructure, IP, and training,
  not just large players 3. Promote UK-EU collaboration, especially in areas like
  power electronics where the UK has deep expertise and shared industrial goals We
  would welcome the opportunity to contribute further to this dialogue and collaborate
  with EU partners through REWIRE and other initiatives.'
