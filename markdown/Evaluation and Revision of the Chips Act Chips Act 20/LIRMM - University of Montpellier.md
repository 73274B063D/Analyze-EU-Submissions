feedback: 'As a public research laboratory specializing in microelectronics and a

  evaluation of the Chips Act and the preparation of "Chips Act 2" . We fully support
  the objective of ensuring technological sovereignty and resilience . However, regarding
  the problem definition and policy options, we urge the Commission to broaden its
  scope beyond currently identified industrial strengths. Although Europe has a competitive
  edge in mainstream semiconductors such as power electronics and sensors , the future
  strategy must not be limited to these mature domains. Public research programs are
  currently driving critical innovations that go well beyond these established sectors.
  To secure the EU''s position in "future-defining technologies" , the Chips Act 2
  must explicitly support R&D in: - Components for Artificial Intelligence: European
  laboratories are pioneering new architectures for edge AI and neuromorphic computing.
  These innovations are vital for the "AI factories" and data centers mentioned in
  the review . - Advanced Design Capabilities: Sovereignty relies as much on design
  capacity as it does on manufacturing . Academic research is crucial for developing
  the next generation of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and complex System-on-Chip
  (SoC) architectures. - Hardware Security: The review highlights the need for economic
  security and insight into technology leakage risks . Research laboratories are the
  primary source of innovation for hardware security, which directly supports the
  strategic goal of advancing the security of components for critical sectors like
  defense and security . Therefore, while we agree with the need to address the lack
  of manufacturing capacity for advanced nodes (<10nm) , the "Chips for Europe Initiative"
  (Pillar 1) must remain sufficiently funded and agile to support these upstream research
  areas. The evaluation should recognize that academic innovation in AI, design, and
  security is a fundamental prerequisite for the long-term competitiveness and strategic
  autonomy of the Union .'
