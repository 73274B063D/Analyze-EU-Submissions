feedback: 'The Chips Act I was primarily focused on new devices and downstream applications,
  utilizing equipment from established suppliers and traditional manufacturing technologies
  to enable it. This left a gap in the Chips Act I, where companies that create new
  chip manufacturing and metrology equipment were essentially left out. In general,
  semiconductor equipment manufacturing is the only place in the global chip manufacturing
  ecosystem that Europe plays an irreplaceable role - and lithography is one of Europe''s
  last tech monopolies. There must be a way for companies that make new chip manufacturing
  or metrology equipment related to the semiconductor industry, to: (1) apply for
  targeted funding programs to bring these innovations to market. With targeted we
  mean smaller, flexible calls which do not require large consortiums with predefined
  commitments which is effectively excluding SMEs from defining and leading the projects;
  (2) fund access and testing of their prototype equipment in the pilot fab lines
  which will be established under the act.'
