feedback: Chips Act 1 successfully strengthened Europes position in advanced manufacturing
  by creating pilot lines, attracting first-of-a-kind fabs, and establishing a coordinated
  framework for supply-chain monitoring. These achievements form a strong foundation,
  but Universities urgently need faster and more affordable prototyping, as long lead
  times currently are severely limiting research throughput. Prototyping costs must
  be reduced to approach the near-zero levels available in Taiwan, Korea, and China,
  allowing academics to test unconventional and high-risk ideas. Chips Act 2 should
  guarantee regular MPW shuttles not only for advanced CMOS, but also for BCD, high-voltage
  SOI, GaN/GaN-on-SOI, SiC, and other special technologies that are essential for
  power electronics and mixed-signal research. At least two academic shuttle runs
  per year per technology family would greatly improve planning and research continuity.
  Academic groups also require accessible advanced packaging and assembly options
  to support system-level prototypes. Strengthened support for EDA tools and design
  infrastructure is needed to train future semiconductor engineers and reduce barriers
  for university labs. Faster, simpler, and more transparent funding mechanisms would
  help academic institutions participate more effectively. By expanding on the strengths
  of Chips Act 1 and addressing these academic needs, Chips Act 2 can significantly
  improve Europes research capabilities and global competitiveness.
