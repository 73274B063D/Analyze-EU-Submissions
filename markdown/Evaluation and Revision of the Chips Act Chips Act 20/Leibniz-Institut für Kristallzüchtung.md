feedback: There is no doubt that Europe must strengthen its competitiveness in the
  semiconductor sector significantly decrease its dependencies on chips required for
  system-relevant industries in Europe like automotive, mechanical engineering or
  others. As mentioned in the VDE-position paper "Hidden electronics IV", it is highly
  recommended to strengthen the entire semiconductor system across the entire value
  chain. Europe must close existing gaps and prioritize support for those areas where
  expertise has been lost. This includes explicitly semiconductor materials as prerequisite
  for chip production, i.e. bulk crystal growth, wafering, and epitaxial layer deposition
  should be considered in this context. In addition, upcoming markets should be considered.
  This will require the development of new and advanced materials and their transition
  into industrial production. This includes new chip architectures and processing
  lines, but will also offer Europe a real opportunity to take a leading position.
  New markets include memristive chips for applications in machine learning & artificial
  intelligence, advanced high-power electronics for mobility as well as for energy
  harvesting and storing, as well as chips for quantum computing and communication.
  While the latter is already addressed through specific initiatives, the design and
  development of chips for AI and for high-efficiency power electronics should certainly
  considered a strategic priority. In this context, wide-bandgap materials may become
  one of the key enabling technologies. Promising emerging materials with large band
  gaps, such as aluminium nitride (AlN) or gallium oxide (Ga2O3) have already demonstrated
  their outstanding properties in device prototypes. Other promising materials, especially
  for memristive devices, are hafnium oxide (HfO2) on silicon or perovskites such
  as strontium or calcium titanate (SrTiO3, CaTiO3). Europe can build here on existing
  expertise. However, pilot lines for crystals growth, epitaxial layer deposition
  and device fabrication are required to transfer these capabilities into application
  and thus industrial competitiveness. Designing and producing new chips cannot be
  decoupled from advances in materials and materials processing. Therefore, close
  interaction with the recently established IAM-I would be highly beneficial and would
  enable synergies across the value chain. Power electronics play a crucial role in
  two of the target markets, namely materials for sustainable transport and materials
  for new energies. Memristive materials would be covered by the "material for electronic
  appliances" market. A coordinated effort to build a nearly complete ecosystem for
  these new materials and chip systems would provide a substantial advantage for Europe.
  One of the most critical steps in this process is the establishment of pilot lines
  across the various stages of the value chain. Supporting start-ups, especially in
  the early stages of the production chain, could accelerate this development. In
  summary, these measures can offer Europe a unique opportunity to establish a strong,
  competitive and resilient semiconductor landscape.
