feedback: 'The Chips Act (CA1) could achieve greater impact if it considered a broader
  spectrum of industry domains in its funding approach. 1. Balanced Industry Coverage
  :While the automotive sector has rightly been given high priority, other strategically
  important domains such as AI, Energy, and Robotics also deserve stronger attention.
  A more balanced allocation would ensure that Europe maintains competitiveness across
  all critical sectors. 2. Focus of ECS: Calls At present, only one ECS call is dedicated
  specifically to semiconductors, while the majority address systems, value chains,
  and pilot-related topics. Increasing the number of semiconductor-focused calls would
  strengthen the core objective of the Chips Act. 3. Role of RTOs: Significant resources
  have been allocated to RTOs for technologies that may only reach maturity in 4-7
  years, addressing a relatively small portion of the semiconductor market. Furthermore,
  a considerable share of this funding is consumed by high personnel costs. Introducing
  reasonable salary caps for professors and researchers could help direct more funds
  toward technology development and industrial impact. 4. Support for SMEs: SMEs are
  the backbone of innovation but face a unique challenge: unlike RTOs, which may specialize
  in one domain of the value chain, SMEs often need to cover the entire spectrumfrom
  specification, chip design, and PCB development to testing. This requires broad
  expertise and significant resources. Stronger, tailored support for SMEs is essential,
  as their survival depends on achieving successful designs; failure or underperformance
  cannot simply be absorbed as it might be in larger organizations. 5. Expertise and
  Evaluation: The evaluation/review of CA1 projects could benefit from fresh perspectives.
  Previous approaches often set unrealistic targets, creating unnecessary risks for
  smaller participants. A new panel of experts, with meaningful SME representation,
  would help ensure that targets are both ambitious and achievable. SMEs, who take
  on the greatest risks, must be adequately represented in decision-making. Meanwhile,
  larger MNCs, whose focus is often on stock market performance and leadership positioning,
  should be balanced with input from those driving innovation at the grassroots level.
  6. Enhanced Support for Intellectual Property (IP): SMEs should be provided with
  additional financial support to file patents. This would encourage innovation, strengthen
  the competitiveness of SMEs, and enable them to better withstand global cost pressures,
  particularly from countries such as China. (For example, we incurred costs of approximately
  29,000 to file patents in Austria and the United States, while the support received
  was limited to around 6,000. This gap makes it difficult for us to pursue further
  protection of our innovations. As a result, we are currently discouraged from filing
  a patent on our breakthrough work in 3D imaging with depth estimation, a technology
  with significant potential for robotics and machine vision.) 7. Equal Participation
  in All Projects: SMEs should have the opportunity to participate in every type of
  project including IPCEI and pilot lines on the same footing as other institutes
  and organizations. This ensures that their expertise and innovative capacity are
  fully integrated into the European semiconductor ecosystem. 8. Dedicated Budget
  Allocation for SMEs: To generate quality jobs and support grassroots innovation,
  a minimum of 30% of the budget in all EC-funded projects should be allocated to
  SMEs. For ECS projects, this allocation should be increased to at least 50%. Such
  measures would ensure that SMEs receive the support necessary to contribute meaningfully
  while also maintaining a healthy and diverse European innovation landscape.'
