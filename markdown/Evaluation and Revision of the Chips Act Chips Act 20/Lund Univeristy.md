# Skills, innovation and scale-up in Compound Semiconductors – A Swedish pilot line to boost European Sustainability and Resilience


Compound semiconductors are critically needed to enable the digital transformation, electrification and
quantum revolution. Compound semiconductors are also an area where Europe already has worldwide
leadership in science and technology, giving it a strong position, both to defend and to further develop.
In light of this, lab-to-fab transfer and the capacity to innovate advanced chips should be consolidated
and strengthened.


To achieve these aims, there is an urgent need for a skilled workforce of technicians, engineers, and
scientists familiar with clean room techniques and with semiconductor characterization and production
technology. Europe also needs to provide access to the equipment and the competence sought by various
stakeholders – start-up companies, institutes as well as established firms – to develop innovations from
idea to market, providing employment opportunities in Europe which will contribute to European
sovereignty and resilience in this critical area.


**Lund University has the capacity and ambition to host an integrated Research & Training Centre**
**and Pilot line that addresses these needs within the specific area of Compound Semiconductors.**


Compound semiconductor nanodevice technology makes it possible to harvest the superior performance
of specific, highly optimized material combinations on established silicon (Si) platforms. State-of-theart compound semiconductor device technology is presently deployed in transistor and solar technology
in European projects and developed for optical display techniques, future communication and radartechnology, sensor implementation for drug delivery, reconfigurable RF-electronics, neuromorphics,
and the next generation of AI technology. Wide bandgap materials and power devices are under
development and supported by the already established Pilot Line 4. For compound devices, generic
process modules are created, and Process Design Kits (PDKs) have been established for devices created
from our understanding of compound nanotechnology and material properties.


Our aim is to establish a European Centre and Pilot line that **integrates leading-edge research with**
**workforce education including hands-on training in state-of-the-art semiconductor technology as**
**well as lab-to-fab transfer** . The Centre will make the technology available for European users through
links to key innovation hubs in Europe as well as to the available Pan European network of competence
centers and thus enable start-ups and SMEs to bring the information technology of the future to the
market. The Centre will be located in the vicinity of the national Swedish Chips Competence Center
(SCCC) to facilitate synergies and coordination. The effort will complement and support related
activities in Pilot lines including APECS, WBG, and PIXE with a unique effort on innovation at lower
TRLs and tech-transfer towards production.


The Pilot line will be embedded in the unique environment in Lund, Sweden, where the following
elements for a link in the European semiconductor value chain are already in place:


  - Lund University, ranked highly in Europe [1] with 46000 students, including 10 000
engineering students (ranked #1 worldwide in Sustainability and #3 worldwide in Innovation).

  - NanoLund, one of the world’s leading research environments for compound semiconductor
nanotechnology located at Lund University (500 scientists and staff).

  - A long tradition in circuit design using PDKs and commercial foundry services in advanced
Si CMOS nodes, as well as the development of unique PDKs for compound nanodevices.

  - Lund Nano Lab (LNL), an existing state-of-the-art cleanroom for academic research and
education, provision of skills and staff training programs. The clean room already today
provides hands-on training in clean room techniques to 100 students annually on leading-edge
compound nanodevice technologies. LNL is an open facility available for industrial users
from the Nordics countries and Europe facilitated through Myfab and NFFA.EU.

  - Science Village, encompassing the ESS European Research Infrastructure Consortium
(ERIC), the world’s most powerful neutron source for advanced materials investigation (1.8
B€), as well as MAX IV, the world’s brightest synchrotron, with unique capabilities to
support nanomaterial and device development (400 M€).

  - Location in one of Europe’s most innovative regions. Sweden as a country is consistently
ranked number 1 on the European innovation scoreboard.

  - A European semiconductor industry network with the experience and competence to guide
SME development and to integrate device innovations, ensuring deep-tech uptake.

  - Coordination and participation in several national industry-academy collaboration centers
including ACT, (Advanced Chip Technologies), Sentio, classIC, C3NiT, and SCCC. These
centres form natural links to research and development within several international companies
including Ericsson, SAAB, Volvo Cars, Tetra Pak, as well as a number of SMEs and start-ups
with ambition to expand activities on the European markets and contributing to European
resilience.

  - A network of well-developed collaborations with key European institutions in the form of
funded EU-projects, including IMEC, several Fraunhofer institutes, CEA/LETI, VTT, Tyndall
national institute as well as a large number of European universities.

As a key element of the envisioned new Pilot line, Lund University is in the process of designing
Nanolab Science Village **,** a new 1500 m [2] clean room specifically designed for leading-edge research,
workforce training and deep-tech innovation in compound semiconductor technology (TRL 1-6). **To**
**fully realize the potential of Nanolab Science Village as a Pilot line for compound semiconductor**
**nanodevices, European co-investment is required.**

The proposed integration of the pilot line with university-based research operations will enable us to
provide **hands-on training in semiconductor technology and clean room techniques to a large**
**number of engineering students** . University-based, lower-TRL research in, for example,
neuromorphics, quantum technology, radar- and communication technology, and alternative computing
technologies will be a **strong** **attractor for new, innovation-minded talent** to the semiconductor
sector **.**

We further propose the expansion of the production pilot-line facilities, operated in Lund targeting the
higher TRLs. Additional European investments into these facilities would provide the equipment and
know-how to enable both up-scaling and production of compound semiconductors as a resource to
European industry, institutes and start-ups, forming a complete deep-tech hub with connections to
complimentary European efforts.

These investments and more leverage the European and national investments to date (exceeding 3 B€)
for advanced materials infrastructures at ESS, MAX IV and Lund University in Science Village.


The total required investment for realizing the Lund node contribution to this vision is 50 - 100
M€ in capital investment and 5-10 M€ annually in running costs.

# **Annex 1: Specification of Pilot line for Compound semiconductor** **nanodevices**

Expected Outcome: The proposed Lund effort is expected to contribute to the following outcomes:


 - Broadly accessible pilot line fostering the creation of electronic, photonic and sensing devices

and systems (co-)integrating compound nanodevices starting at lower TRLs and bridging the
transitions towards operational Pilot Lines, for instance related to heterogeneous integration.


 - Innovation building on new technology for future radar and communication as well as

neuromorphic implementation, leveraging technology development within European projects.


 - Establish a strong link with European institutions in the form of a Pilot Line for compound

semiconductors.


 - Significant progress towards the adoption of the compound nanodevices in the silicon and semi
conductor arena by allowing the production of new (co-)integrated devices and systems in a
quality-controlled way.


 - Formation of innovative start-up companies (several annually) building on a strong track record

on innovation to drive economic growth in Europe.


 - Building on existing investments in ESS and Max IV to develop the innovative ecosystem in

Lund Science Village.


Scope: We will use our strong experience in compound nanodevices and their integration on Si CMOS
platforms and initially build on the IP developed, to establish a compound nanodevice pilot line(s),
where European companies, research centres and academic institutions, can produce on a pilot scale
novel electronic and/or photonic devices and systems integrating compound semiconductors.


The Lund effort will focus on the (co-)integration of compound nanodevices with established
technologies such as CMOS [2] integration and heterogeneous integration. The focus will be on highperformance electronics, optoelectronics, power technology, and sensor technology and their
integration on Si CMOS platforms.


The multidisciplinary research and innovation activities will address:


 - Building the toolkit and design modules necessary for creating prototype devices and systems,

characterise and assess their performance and their ability to cover the device requirements of
the targeted applications.


 - Process characterisation and monitoring to control and guarantee quality of relevant device

parameters and to allow yield predictions of the integrated devices, in particular using _in-situ_
and _operando_ investigations at Max IV and ESS


 - Integration with education, offering hands-on training at many levels: engineering students,

PhD-students, and future clean room personnel.

 - Adaptation of standard semiconductor technologies including passivation schemes, strategies to

align devices over different technologies, modules to contact the compound nanodevices with
the periphery, optimized planarization strategies and packaging services.


 - Reliability and packaging requirements in collaboration with established technologies within the

available pilot lines.


 - Implementing multiple wafer runs or other offering to best cover business opportunities


 - Defining a sustainable model of functioning beyond the project lifetime, and include activities

preparing for the later transfer of the pilot line to an industrial production environment;
examples of such activities include addressing relevant cost issues and market perspectives,
potential business partners, etc.


In addition, the Lund pilot line will develop a business case and exploitation strategy, in line with
strategies commonly used in RIAs.


Research should build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation whenever suitable.
Interoperability for data sharing should be addressed.


We will build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant
European, national, or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms. Projects are expected to
develop synergies and relate to activities and outcomes of the projects selected under the other topics.


We will cover the contribution to the governance and overall coordination of within the European Chips
Act initiative.


To host the Pilot line, Lund University plans to construct Nanolab Science Village, scheduled for
completion by 2029/2030.

collaboration and innovation as central enablers. We aim for
collaborations within innovation and development areas where
our stakeholders face common challenges and where research
can be part of a solution. Established collaborations with large multi-billion turnover companies include
Ericsson, Alfa Laval, IBM, Volvo Cars and Tetra Pak. We are systematically creating networking and
competence exchanges with both large companies and smaller ones, including start-ups. Another
growing collaboration area is characterisation of materials and functional devices, including gateway
activities for international leading facilities MAX IV and ESS. This includes both working directly on
semiconductor technology as well as with industrial users of semiconductor technology (such as the
production industries). We support innovation activities and researchers have been successful in
pushing tailored nanostructures to the market through spin-off companies. In recent years, the number
of active spin-off companies has averaged around 15 at any given time. These companies are important
collaboration partners, users of the open infrastructures and offer career opportunities for students and
post-docs. Companies have also already successfully attracted prestigious funding from the European
Innovation Council (EIC).

**NanoLund Infrastructure:** NanoLund is heavily involved in both running, developing, and using a
wide range of infrastructures. NanoLund has a key responsibility for Lund Nano Lab (LNL). LNL
constitutes one node of Myfab, the national research infrastructure for micro and nanofabrication.
Myfab was 2020 rated outstanding (and best) in the overarching national infrastructure evaluation. LNL
is an open research facility (e.g. part of LTH OpenDoor) available to academic research groups, startups and company users. Another important task for LNL is to educate students enrolled at Lund

University. The user base of the LNL, which was designed originally for 40-50 users, has tripled to 140
users since 2007 and Lund University has decided to establish a new Nanolab in Science Village. The
new Nanolab Science Village will be the third major research facility at Science Village alongside MAX
IV and ESS. Whereas MAX IV and ESS focus on materials analysis, Nanolab Science Village will
become the first infrastructure in Science Village to create new advanced materials and promote device
technology at higher TRLs. The planning and preparations for Nanolab Science Village will be a major
exciting and important task in the coming years with a total investment of ~60MEURO.

NanoLund researchers possess an extensive range of cutting-edge characterisation instruments and
techniques ranging from microscopes capable of e.g. single-atom imaging, single cell manipulation and
advanced imaging, milliKelvin electrical/magnetic measures and ultrafast spectroscopy to the
femto/attosecond timescale. These characterisation laboratories are coordinated by Lund Nano
Characterisation Labs (LNCL) and are distributed across LU. The nCHREM facility (part of the
national ARTEMIS infrastructure network) has state-of-the-art tools for electron microscopy, including
a Environmental transmission electron microscopy for in-situ experiments uniquely suited for studying
compound semiconductors. The community develop and use major cutting-edge characterisation tools
at synchrotron facilities, such as MAX IV. This includes the strong engagement in beamline and strategy
development starting with the initial conception of MAX IV and continuing today. Members also
develop and use neutron facilities worldwide and collaborate with the ESS.

**NanoLund at the new campus:** NanoLund will play a central role in the efforts to establish a new
campus area at Science Village and integrate research with the MAX IV and ESS facilities. This
includes both strategic developments and real implementation. Most of the activities in the area will in
the next 5-10 years be co-localized in an interconnected building complex. The integration of this large
truly interdisciplinary gathering of competences and infrastructures in one place has a significant
development potential also driving forward other parts of Lund University. We are highly committed
to strengthening the integration between research and education, for example through undergraduate
student memberships and many activities in undergraduate education programs. We have made it a
specific point to address the implementation of technology in companies, including addressing the
safety and recycling aspects. We have a broad academic age distribution and established procedures for
recruiting new members for further development. NanoLund has a basic strength in the low TRLs, but
given the technologies and methods we are moving towards higher TRLs reaching 4-6 in semiconductor
tech.

**NanoLund visions for the future:** In the future, heterogeneous integration of device technologies will
increasingly shape emerging ICT applications beyond 2030 and it is the aim to be an important player
in this area. New technology is vital for future communication systems, electrification, energy efficient
electronics, and to improve renewable energy sources and autonomous systems. The center constitutes
a critical mass with strong scientific and technical positions in **semiconductor material science** as well
as **device and circuit technology** connecting both to local and international industry, and into **unique**
**infrastructure** in Lund. We will drive a strategy for **functional integration of III-V and III-N**
**technology on Si and Si CMOS.** We will focus on identified process modules that can be applied to
several technologies and create a common process platform centered **around PhD education** . We will
support new application driven material research and enable processing at higher Technical Readiness
Levels (TRLs 4-6). We will continue to take a leading role in Europe in selected key areas of
semiconductor technology.

**Research goals with 5-10 years perspective:**

- _Communication and computing technology:_ The implementation of key aspects within the
evolution of 6G and development of 7G technology is expected to be hardware-centric based on
heterogeneous technology integration. Such device technology requiring above 100 GHz is a
multidisciplinary challenge and area of strong potential in Lund. Algorithms for AI and machine
learning consume unsustainable amounts of energy and add to latency, calling for new
neuromorphic (brain-inspired) hardware, for efficient connectivity and integrating memory and
computation via new materials and concepts.


7


- _Electrification, energy-saving, and clean energy:_ The efficiency of power converters is critical in
the electrification of industry and society. We have excellent strength in wide-band gap
semiconductors that show a strong promise combining high breakdown voltages and drive currents.
The technical development within energy harvesting by solar technology will continue to be vital
for a fossil-free society. Increasing efficiency over a wide spectral range requires the integration of
multiple materials and complex nano architectures. Optical interconnects to Si chips is one key
technology for power-efficient data transfer.

- _Sensor technology and autonomous systems:_ New sensor technology will assist in climate
monitoring, industrial automation, healthcare, and presence detection. An example is radar sensors
exploring technology within the D-band (>100 GHz). Integration of improved thin film materials
on lab-on-a-chip devices is a natural next step towards an autonomous system. New technology
such as integration of solar technology with Si CMOS and dedicated sensors opens for self-powered
autonomous small systems in addition to the further development of established technologies.
