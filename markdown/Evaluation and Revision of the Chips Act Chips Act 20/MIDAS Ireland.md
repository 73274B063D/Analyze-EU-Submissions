# **European Commission Public Consulta�on** **on the Review of the European Chips Act**


**November 28th, 2025**


I welcome the opportunity to make a submission to the Public Consulta�on on the Review of the
European Chips Act on behalf of MIDAS Ireland.


MIDAS is the industry associa�on represen�ng the semiconductor / microelectronics sector in
Ireland. Established in 1999, MIDAS is an industry led partnership consis�ng of mul�na�onal and
local companies, educa�onal organisa�ons, research ins�tu�ons and government agencies working
together to address common challenges within the sector in Ireland. MIDAS has about 90 member
organiza�ons today.


There are currently about 20,000 people employed in over 100 companies opera�ng across the Irish
Semiconductor ecosystem. Businesses range from semiconductor wafer fabs to chip design, services
and advanced factory construc�on. The sector contributes about €13.5 Billion in exports annually to
the Irish economy with many thousands of jobs in advanced R&D, Chip Design and Product
Development.


Following on from the 2023 EU Chips Act, Ireland developed its own Na�onal Semiconductor
Strategy called Silicon Island, which was launched by Minster for Enterprise, Mr Peter Burke, at
Tyndall Na�onal Ins�tute in May of this year. This strategy represents a very strong endorsement of
the sector from the highest levels of the Irish Government.


The strategy sets ambi�ous goals to invest in and significantly grow the sector with three primary
strands in the areas of _Building on our Exis�ng Strong Ecosystem_, _Ensuring that there is a robust_
_Talent Pipeline_, and _Iden�fying and Seizing new Growth Opportuni�es_, whether they be in
Manufacturing or R&D. Across each of these three stands, there are a number of specific ac�ons, so
the ambi�ons of the strategy will become a reality.


In their report from Sept 2024, KPMG es�mated that 34,500 addi�onal semiconductor jobs can be
created by 2040. Essen�ally the goal is to more than double the size of both Manufacturing and R&D
areas, which is in line with the aspira�ons of the EU Chips Act.


In the Ar�ficial Intelligence (AI) area, which is the next significant growth driver for this sector,
Ireland is in a very strong posi�on to contribute to Europe’s future success. It has all the key building
blocks in place, with many leading global AI companies, significant chip design, research, state-of-the
art manufacturing and advanced factory construc�on opera�ng and located in Ireland

For a future EU Chips Act, the following are some areas that should be considered.


1. Innova�on.
(i) There should be a con�nued focus on building out the innova�on infrastructure and
ecosystem across Europe. Some excellent progress is already underway on the Pilot
Lines, Design Pla�orm and Competence Centres. These ini�a�ves need to become fully
opera�onal and further expanded on.
(ii) As capability and leading-edge IP is developed within the research and university
ecosystem, there needs to be an increased focus on commercialising these assets.
Licensing and spinout of this IP and exper�se from the research ecosystem into new
start-up companies needs to be much easier and ac�vely encouraged.
(iii) Funding for start-ups is probably their single biggest challenge today. Europe lags the rest
of the World in terms of access to New Venture Finance today, and it is cri�cal that this is
fixed, so Europe can have its fair share of next genera�on ‘Unicorns’.

2. To support the forecasted growth, there will need to be a drama�c increase in the talent

pipeline for the semiconductor / semiconductor sector.
(i) This needs an increased entry to the STEM disciplines at third level. It also needs an
increased percentage of STEM students choosing the semiconductor sector. This
‘conversion’ of STEM students to research and industry roles in this sector is way lower
than it should be today, and needs to be drama�cally increased.
(ii) To achieve an increase in STEM students, there needs to be a coordinated effort to
influence the school curriculum (Primary, 2 [nd] and 3 [rd] Levels) to incorporate the sector’s
needs into what students learn and a connec�on built with teachers at each level such
that they understand what the sector does and what career opportuni�es exist, and pass
this knowledge to their students.
(iii) Probably the most important thing the sector needs to do is to market itself be�er to
those outside the sector (students, parents and the general public) and tell the stories of
where our technology is used and the incredible societal benefit of Semiconductors and
how they directly contribute to solving all of the world’s greatest challenges.
(iv) This is an ever-evolving sector with skills needs changing and expanding at an everincreasing pace. This necessitates a constant up-skilling of the sector’s exis�ng workforce
and hiring experienced people with new skillsets from adjacent sectors, and in par�cular
those applica�on areas that use semiconductors.

3. Expanding Europe’s Semiconductor Manufacturing Footprint.
(i) Future manufacturing investments should be focussed on a business need within Europe
with a view to enhancing Europe’s long-term security and semiconductor supply lines.
(ii) While _first-of-a-kind_ is an interes�ng and laudable ambi�on, it should not be the only
considera�on taken into account. Where there is a business / market need for a supply
line to be present in Europe, then that should be encouraged and supported, even if it
doesn’t strictly align to the _first-of-a-kind_ criteria.

The primary focus of my submission is to summarise the general areas that I strongly believe need to
be supported, while not specifically referencing the precise content of what will be incorporated into
any future EU legisla�on.


I hope this is helpful to the process, and I am very happy to discuss in more detail if that is requested.


Yours sincerely,
