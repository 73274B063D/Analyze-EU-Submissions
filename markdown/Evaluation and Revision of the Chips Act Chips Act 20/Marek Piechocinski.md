feedback: The Chips Act must consider the full development cycle of the microsystem.
  Access to the design tool chain, fabrication, and test house is still limited by
  high entry costs. That used to work for the established businesses and research
  institutions. In the future, that has to change to lower the entry threshold for
  the private research organizations. I can't see any signs of change to that in the
  forthcoming regulations. Ironically, it is easier to access Canadian and US-based
  resources in that respect. The Chips Act needs to support and favor establishing
  startups in this area.
