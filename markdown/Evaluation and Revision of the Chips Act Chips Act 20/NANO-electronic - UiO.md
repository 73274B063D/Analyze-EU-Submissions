feedback: At the University of Oslo, NANO-electronics group, we utilize the options
  and opportunities offered through, among other the EUROPRACTICE project to get access
  to state-of-the-art tools and technology. At our group we focus on next generation
  integrated RF and radar technology, sensor interfaces and converters, bioinspired/neuromorphic
  electronics in our research. We offer study programs that span from undergraduate
  level to PhD program. Our study programs and our research supply local and international
  industries with candidates capable of continuing the technology development in the
  electronic field, specifically integrated circuits. The EU Chips Act goal is to
  strengthen Europe's semiconductor ecosystem, spanning research, design, manufacturing
  and advanced packaging. For the University of Oslo and the NANO-electronics group,
  initiatives like this enable us to be a part of the Chips-JU funded Norwegian competence
  center CC-Norchip to further support the goals of the Chips Act. Furthermore, it
  will enable us to continue to be a relevant partner in research and fulfilling our
  social mission of supplying relevant research to society and supplying relevant
  candidates to industry and public service. Yours sincerely, Olav Stanly Kyrvestad
