feedback: The rationale behind Chips Act 2 is to secure European competitiveness and
  to be less reliant on Asian sourcing. A chip needs a carrier to be used, thus the
  Chips Act 2 must include materials, equipment, design and manufacturing of IC substrates,
  Interposers and Ultra HDI PCBs. Without these processes and products Chips Act 2
  will fail.
