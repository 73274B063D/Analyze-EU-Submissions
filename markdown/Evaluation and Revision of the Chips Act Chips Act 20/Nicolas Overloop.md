feedback: I would like to add that the EU can create demand for such commercial foundry
  by using tariffs on the end-products carrying those chips. Trump's reasoning that
  subsidies don't work so well but tariffs do for bringing home industries is correct
  and it's more affordable because it's money coming in rather than money going out.
  Another tool one could consider is a form of yield insurance that would stimulate
  competition from TSMC (Samsung, Intel) to set down in the EU because they in turn
  can attract more clients as the EU covers bad yields. That insurance will help those
  foundry competitors to develop and improve their tooling over time to the point
  they no longer need yield insurance. One could look at the economics of Samsung
  foundry and Intel foundry and find levers to help them break TSMC's market dominance.
