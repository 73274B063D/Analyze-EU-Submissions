feedback: I would like to add that it's not just the chips itself but also the PCB's.
  High-frequency radio hardware requires special, more suitable PCBs, such as electronic
  warfare systems, 5G systems, phased arrays,... From my understanding only the US
  and China have such PCB manufacturing at the moment and it has large backlogs to
  order (6 months). The act probably needs extending to incorporate industries vital
  to national security. Then, I would urge the EU to consider export restrictions
  on the latest ASML factory equipment to force the world to build those plants here
  if they absolutely want the smallest chips. This breeds dependency on EU trade links
  but also guarantees Europe has the latest technology. For this, those could be added
  to export restricted materials and export licenses could be denied if no such foundry
  exists in the EU. This assumes that ASML's technology edge is a defacto monopoly,
  which I am not sure is the case. As for state-aid, I think the EU should consider
  developing a sovereign wealth fund like the US is developing now and Norway already
  has that manages investments at arms-length but can execute mandates given to it
  by states through subfunds. Having it managed at EU level ensures a level playing
  field inside Europe and I don't believe we care about outside Europe at this point.
  The other advantage of this is that revenue from such investments can be recycled
  in the fund and government capture by industry is mooted as such revenue would not
  flow into the state budgets again. Such a fund can be an equity investor also, rather
  than providing grants/subsidies.
