feedback: 'Identifying a Critical Dependency for European Sovereignty Nomenil B.V.
  is a Dutch technology SME (KvK 98077635) developing a data-driven software platform
  (N-1) to solve the core process-control bottleneck in Functional Additive Manufacturing
  (AM). Our initial focus is enabling the high-volume, high-accuracy production of
  advanced Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). We strongly support the strategic goals
  of the Chips Act. However, we submit this evidence to highlight a critical dependency
  that must be addressed in the "Chips Act 2" to ensure the Acts ultimate success:
  Technological sovereignty in leading-edge semiconductor chips is functionally impossible
  without parallel sovereignty in the advanced packaging and substrate value chain.
  The Problem: The "Artisanal" Bottleneck in Advanced Packaging The review correctly
  identifies that the EU is dependent on non-EU countries for leading-edge chips (Problem
  1) and that "advanced packaging, test and assembly" (Pillar 2) is a key focus. The
  problem is that these two issues are inseparable. Advanced chips require equally
  advanced, high-density interconnects and substrates (like PCBs), which cannot be
  manufactured reliably with current methods. The promise of Additive Manufacturing
  (e.g., inkjet technology) to deliver this capability has failed, not due to the
  equipment, but due to the process. The current "artisanal" R&D methoda manual, non-scalable,
  trial-and-error processis incapable of guaranteeing the required process reproducibility
  (e.g., 25µm accuracy over large areas). This process failure is the primary innovation
  bottleneck blocking the EUs strategic sectors (defence, automotive, space) from
  adopting flexible, localized PCB production. It creates a critical dependency on
  non-EU supply chains for complex substrates, mirroring the dependency in the chips
  themselves. Our Contribution: Enabling Pillar 2 and Strengthening the Ecosystem
  As a European technology provider, our N-1 platform directly addresses this bottleneck.
  We do not manufacture chips or PCBs; we provide the enabling process knowledge that
  makes advanced manufacturing scalable and reliable. Enabling Advanced Packaging
  (Pillar 2): The N-1 platform replaces "artisanal" R&D with a systematic, data-driven
  calibration framework. It allows manufacturers to generate Digital Correction Profilesa
  scalable, verifiable form of Process IP. This is the "knowledge in a box" that finally
  delivers the 25µm accuracy and reliability required for the high-density interconnects
  that advanced chips depend on. Strengthening Supply Chain Resilience (Pillar 1 &
  3): By solving the process bottleneck, our solution enables a secure, decentralized,
  and flexible European supply chain for advanced PCBs. This is vital for the "strategic
  sectors" that require low-volume, high-mix, and secure components without relying
  on non-EU, high-volume fabs. Strengthening the Entire EU Value Chain: The current
  artisanal support burden is unsustainable, not just for the PCB manufacturers (the
  "pioneers") but also for the (often European) capital equipment suppliers. Our platform
  removes this burden, liberating equipment suppliers to focus on innovation rather
  than costly, non-scalable manual support. Our solution is an ecosystem enabler,
  turning potential competitors into allies focused on a common goal. Recommendation
  for "Chips Act 2" Review We urge the Commission to ensure the review and subsequent
  "Chips Act 2" explicitly recognize that "advanced packaging" and "substrate manufacturing"
  are fundamental dependencies, not just secondary considerations. The Act must expand
  its focus to include support for the enabling process technologieslike data-driven
  calibration and process IP generation frameworksthat unlock this critical part of
  the value chain. By investing in the process, the EU can finally secure the entire
  ecosystem, from substrate to chip, and deliver on the full promise of technological
  sovereignty.'
