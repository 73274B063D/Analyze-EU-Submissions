feedback: Including PCB production and population in the European Chips Act 2.0 is
  important to increase technological independence. Chips alone do not create functional
  systems; reliable PCB and board population with electronic components is an important
  step to produce reliable functional systems. Today, Europe relies heavily on Asian
  assembly for high volume products. Challenges to the PCB technological evolution
  and PCB population are driven by dedicated high pin-count devices (e.g. µ-vias,
  multiple layer stackings, heat dissipation, coating) and require highly specialized
  board population processes (temperature profiles, solder alloys, soldering techniques).
  Relying with respect to these crucial process on non-European sources leaves strategic
  sectors exposed to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks. By enhancing
  PCB and EMS capabilities, Europe can secure its entire electronics value chain and
  strengthen resilience. This capability is vital for space applications, where satellites
  demand high-reliability PCBs and EMS processes. It is also crucial for defense systems,
  ensuring operational sovereignty and preventing foreign interference in mission-critical
  technologies. Furthermore, domestic PCB and EMS enhances data security by reducing
  risks of hardware-level tampering and supports compliance with EU cybersecurity
  and privacy standards. Beyond security, investing in PCB and EMS drives economic
  growth, creates high-tech jobs and accelerates innovation in aerospace, automotive
  and other sectors. It maximizes the return on semiconductor investments by completing
  the ecosystem from chip to board. Localized production also supports Europes sustainability
  goals by lowering carbon emissions associated with global supply chains and enabling
  greener manufacturing practices. For Europe to maintain leadership in space, defense
  and critical infrastructure, PCB and EMS is recommended to be included in funding,
  standards development and collaborative initiatives under Chips Act 2.0.
