feedback: The overall framework is going in the right direction and great steps having
  taking, especially by focalizing on end products/outcomes and not only fundamental
  research and low TRLs. One of the unsolved problems in Europe in accessing the latest
  technology nodes is that we lack enough cutting edge designs that can justify the
  volume needed for the mayor markets (DC, automotive, connectivity). In other regions
  there is NVIDIA, Apple, Google, Bydance, Huawei among others that are delivering
  vertical solutions (and or horizonal platforms for several verticals). There is
  a great opportunity (and risk of not doing it) of combining data centre semiconductor
  infrastructure with the multiple verticals that can benefit from a centralise AI-farm
  and HPC compute that allows a continuous learning of Edge compute and Centralise
  compute. Robotaxi's (level 4) systems required high performance compute on the device
  and huge data center infrastructure for training (Telsa has publicly said that they
  are building a DC with 50K H100 GPUS for the sole propuse of training cars). This
  is the kind of initiatives that will enable enough synergies and economies of scale
  to have the latest technologies factories in EU. In terms of next-step we need to
  enable an infrastructure for the digital world with EU technology (SW and HW) which
  can be used to design in tandem with the Edge semiconductors (Automotive, Robotics,
  Wireless communications). We do not need to start with the most efficient but rather
  the most flexible architecture that enables a quick learning phase. This can be
  done by adapting DC architectures to the Edge devices. Getting enough funding to
  complement the amount of investment needed to get full commitment in this programs
  and applying DC technologies to EDGE will require a huge investment and partnering
  with the ecosystem. I understand that CHASSIS has been done differently by letting
  the OEM/Tier1 to manage the funding and subcontract as needed research but owning
  the outcome.
