feedback: 'My company is involved in the development, manufacturing and supply of
  materials (adhesive, resin) for the assembly and the protection of electronic circuits
  or bare semiconductor dies. Chip Act 2 is a great opportunity to strengthen the
  industrial and academic eco-system of the electronic sector in Europe. Compared
  to the initial Chip Act, this evolution should target the whole eco-system and not
  only the large upstream companies involved in the semiconductor conversion process.
  A mapping of the European electronics industry should be carried out in order to
  identify which sectors of the industries are the most dependent on non-European
  industries. To develop the sovereignty of the European industry, a special action
  program should support the local players in these identified sectors and EU should
  launch investments, research initiatives or other activities to be defined. In the
  field of the materials for the electronics industry, there are many sectors which
  could benefit support from EU : PCB, Epoxy Molding Compound, Soldering paste...
  End-users should be involved in such initiative since they own the performance requirements
  and thus are able to validate the relevancy of the technical solutions supported
  by EU considering the fast pace at which electronic products are developed.'
