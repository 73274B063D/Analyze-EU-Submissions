feedback: 'Photonics is one of the fastest-growing enabling technologies in Europe.
  In Finland, the photonics industry grows by about 12% annually, and similar rates
  are seen elsewhere. As electronics approach their physical limits, photonics becomes
  indispensable: it offers the means to sustain Moores law and overcome Shannons limit,
  enabling faster, more energy-efficient data transfer and processing. This makes
  photonics not just supportive, but central to Europes long-term technological sovereignty.
  Photonics already underpins many strategic sectors. It enables autonomous vehicles,
  dual-use and defense solutions, advanced healthcare, renewable energy, and quantum
  technologies. In quantum computing, communication, and sensing, photonics is a core
  element without which these breakthroughs cannot materialize. Ensuring strong photonics
  capabilities in Europe is therefore essential to secure competitiveness and resilience
  in these fields. The current Chips Act pilot lines and facilities provide valuable
  support for the automotive and mainstream semiconductor sectors. However, the specific
  needs of photonics are underrepresented. Unlike traditional microelectronics, the
  photonics sector is largely driven by SMEs and start-ups, often located outside
  capital regions. Well-known clusters exist in Joensuu (Finland), Jena (Germany),
  Grenoble (France), and other mid-sized cities. To fully unlock this distributed
  expertise, pilot lines for photonics should also be geographically distributed.
  This would ensure that each Member States know-how benefits the whole Union, and
  that companies can access services close to their ecosystems. There are several
  critical gaps in existing pilot line coverage that need to be filled: Photonic Integrated
  Circuits (PICs) for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Polymers as a
  cost-efficient and lightweight material platform, especially important for defense.
  Antimonide (Sb)-based materials for mid-infrared applications, including epitaxy,
  lasers, and detectors. Glass and specialty fibers for advanced photonic integration,
  interconnections, and light control. Solution-based solar cells for soft, flexible,
  and low-cost renewable energy technologies. In addition, Europe must invest in Optical
  Circuit Boards (OCBs) to manage photons in complex systems. This includes light
  coupling, transmission, splitting, and modulation, relying on innovative optics
  (micro/nano-optics, diffractive and freeform optics, meta-optics, 2D materials,
  waveguides). Such innovations will be vital for hybrid photonicelectronic integration.
  Photonics devices components that generate, manipulate, or detect light already
  play a vital role in communications, imaging, energy, security, and healthcare.
  Their importance will grow further with the rise of quantum technologies, which
  rely heavily on photonics for functionality. Examples of innovations that could
  be accelerated with dedicated pilot line support include: High-speed modulators
  based on thin-film LiNbO3 (TFLN) for hybrid PICs. Smart chip holders introducing
  standards for full-optical and opto-electronic integration, allowing new levels
  of signal mixing and material use. Biomedical photonic chips for advanced diagnostics
  and health monitoring. To remain competitive, the EU must recognize photonics as
  a core pillar of the semiconductor ecosystem. By creating dedicated and distributed
  pilot lines, Europe would strengthen its SME-driven innovation base, reduce strategic
  dependencies, and ensure that photonics continues to power the next generation of
  semiconductor, quantum, and digital technologies.'
