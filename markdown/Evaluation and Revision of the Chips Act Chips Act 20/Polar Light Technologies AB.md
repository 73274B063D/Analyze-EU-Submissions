feedback: A broadened scope beyond the current logic centric Chips Act would allow
  other semiconductor technologies to benefit from incentives and create a more complete
  European ecosystem. Today, the Act focuses primarily on advanced logic nodes leaving
  critical gaps in areas where Europe has strong research capabilities and strategic
  needs. Expanding the scope would strengthen resilience and reduce dependency on
  non-European suppliers. Examples of additional areas include advanced display technologies
  such as MicroLEDs and AR/VR which are essential for next generation automotive,
  medical and immersive applications. Without targeted support, Europe risks losing
  ground to Asia where aggressive national strategies are accelerating commercialization.
  Optical interconnects for AI servers represent another key area enabling ultra-high
  bandwidth and low latency while reducing energy consumption in data centers which
  is a priority as AI workloads grow. Sensing technologies are equally important for
  automotive safety, industrial automation and healthcare. Wide bandgap materials
  (WBG) such as SiC and GaN are crucial for power electronics in electric vehicles,
  renewable energy systems and RF applications for telecom. These materials enable
  higher efficiency and lower energy loss, thus directly supporting EU climate targets.
  Both microLEDs and WBG materials support the Green Deal. Additionally, equipment
  manufacturing such as epitaxy reactors and laser transfer systems must be developed
  within Europe to reduce dependency on foreign toolmakers and secure supply chains.
  Incentives in these areas will unlock high value applications aligned with EU digital
  and green transition goals. MicroLEDs offer low power consumption and long lifespan
  supporting sustainability and energy efficiency. Wide bandgap semiconductors are
  indispensable for EV fast charging renewable energy integration and telecom infrastructure.
  Domestic equipment capability ensures Europe can maintain autonomy in critical manufacturing
  processes. A Chips Act 2.0 should include strategies directed at specific technology
  areas where European research is at the forefront. Taiwans action plan for display
  technologies provides a strong role model demonstrating how targeted policies accelerate
  commercialization. Public procurement mandates should be employed to create demand
  for European components in EU funded projects, particularly for the defense industry
  where independent supply chains are critical. Incentives for large enterprises to
  source components from European SMEs will help create an environment where the transition
  from mainly VC-funded to mainly-revenue funded models becomes easier. To build on
  Europes semiconductor start-up base, effective piloting services must be available
  for SMEs to encourage scaling within the EU. Cost barriers for access to shared
  cleanrooms and bonding facilities should be reduced. Programs focusing on the transition
  from lab-to-fab to reach volume production need to be prioritized, including display
  technologies. Funding for yield optimization during the scaling phase can bridge
  the gap between a first launch of an MVP and commercial scale production. Finally,
  specialized pan-European training programs for new talent and reskilling are necessary
  to address skill shortages. Funding options at the EU level without mandatory national
  co-funding should be created to ensure broader participation and faster deployment.
  The here listed actions and programs would greatly improve the likelihood of successfully
  taking the excellent European research to commercialization, something that today
  is a major weakness in Europe compared to Asian and American ecosystems.
