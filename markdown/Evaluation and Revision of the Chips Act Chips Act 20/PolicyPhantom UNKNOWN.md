feedback: 'The evaluation of the current Chips Act presents an important opportunity
  to strengthen Europes strategic semiconductor capacity while maintaining democratic
  governance, transparency, and long-term resilience. Based on my participation in
  several EU digital-policy consultations, I would offer the following observations.
  First, the Acts strategic intent is sound, but implementation mechanisms remain
  uneven. Europe has made progress in research excellence, yet the translation from
  laboratory outcomes to industrial scale remains fragmented. Public instruments should
  more clearly support open-access testbeds, shared pilot lines, and interoperable
  intellectual-property frameworks that allow SMEs and start-ups to participate without
  disproportionate barriers. Industrial participation needs to be measurable, transparent,
  and linked to clear technology-readiness milestones. Second, supply-chain security
  requires a more principle-based and diversified approach. Current dependency patterns
  in critical materials, equipment, and upstream intellectual property remain a structural
  vulnerability. The revision should explicitly incorporate multi-region redundancy,
  trusted-partner verification, and cross-border risk-sharing mechanisms that align
  with Europes broader quantum, cybersecurity, and space-communication strategies.
  Coordination with IRIS² and the Quantum Act will be essential for end-to-end secure
  semiconductor-enabled infrastructure. Third, governance and interoperability require
  stronger alignment. The Chips Act should avoid parallel, uncoordinated programmes
  by embedding a coherent oversight structure that brings together Member States,
  industry, research organisations, and civil society. A periodic review cycletransparent,
  evidence-based, and linked to emerging riskswould support stable long-term investment
  conditions while safeguarding democratic accountability. Fourth, talent development
  remains a decisive bottleneck. Europes long-term competitiveness depends not only
  on a European Semiconductor Academy but on real mobility: short-cycle reskilling
  pathways, cross-border fellowships, industrial placements, and coordinated STEM-policy
  commitments. Talent leakage to non-EU markets will persist unless scale-up pathways
  are predictable and attractive. Finally, the Acts environmental and energy dimension
  requires clearer prioritisation. Semiconductor manufacturing is highly resource-intensive.
  The revision should strengthen circular-economy principles, green-lab standards,
  and efficient energy-use frameworks while ensuring that sustainability requirements
  do not inadvertently disadvantage SMEs. In summary, the Chips Act can deliver on
  Europes ambition if its revision deepens governance coherence, enables industrial
  participation across the full value chain, and strengthens trusted-partner alignment
  on resilience and security. I remain available to provide further analysis if helpful.'
