feedback: Great idea, but as usual the money is wasted by distributing it mostly to
  tons of small companies that exist only to suck up EU money, big companies that
  exist only to employ Europeans and kick the can around, plus the few usual suspects
  in academia. And Italy pays Italian partners years after the project has started,
  sometimes even years after the project has ended. Sorry about being so negative,
  but I have seen a huge worsening of the quality and quantity of EU funding available
  for truly transformational, or even just good quality, research in the last ten
  years.
