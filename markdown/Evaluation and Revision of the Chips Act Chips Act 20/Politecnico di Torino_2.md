feedback: I have been working in the field of digital integrated circuits since 1999.
  Much of the work carried out by myself and by my research group has been possible
  thanks to the Europractice initiative, which has provided access to professional
  design tools and semiconductor technologies. More recently, with support from the
  PNRR and CHIPS-IT, we successfully completed a RISC-Vbased tapeout in October 2025.
  In my opinion, further European initiatives aimed at supporting chip design are
  essential to sustain innovation in this strategic domain. Moreover, the recent push
  toward open-source tools and technologies is offering new and promising perspectives
  for microelectronics research in Europe. Finally, I believe that sustained support
  is essential for maintaining European competitiveness, enabling universities, research
  centers, and small and medium-sized enterprises to innovate, and helping train the
  next generation of chip designers. Continued investment in multi-project wafer access,
  open-source and professional EDA tools, and advanced-node availability would significantly
  strengthen Europes strategic autonomy in semiconductors.
