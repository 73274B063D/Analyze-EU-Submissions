feedback: The effort of Chips Act 2 should focus not only on semiconductor production
  capability but also on reinvigorating the design capability. This requires an effort
  towards younger generations (high-schoolers and below) to promote the profession
  of integrated circuit (IC) designer so that they enroll in the right courses at
  university level and learn how to design a chip. This also requires continuing giving
  the European universities access to IC design tools and IC production at discounted
  rates via the Europractice initiative (https://europractice-ic.com/).
