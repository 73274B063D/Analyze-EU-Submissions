feedback: First ChipAct package is very dedicated to fundamental key enabling technology
  in front-end manufacturing and research pilot lines. The Design aspect is also touched
  but only via DET approach which lower threshold for end user by again overlap with
  traditional design house and ASIC design house market. I believe the second package
  shall really be focused on our European autonomy on back-end (assembly) and test
  (manufacturing testing) from a supply chain stand point and select carefully the
  segment in which design enablement of chip shall be stimulated. For instance healthcare
  with increasing patient data collection and point of care trend is a key sector
  for semiconductor to bring value beyond the simple gimmick , telecom and datacom
  infrastructure via photonic interfacing (photonic on chip and copackaaging) is the
  second one binding any climate friend increase of AI computation power, and finally
  industrial robotics and sensors making those robots more independent is very important
  for our European economy for productivity gains. However Presto for instance cannot
  convert project into ASIC since the bar is raised high by the supply chain for our
  Customers in this market. On the opposite we consider that enough emphasis has been
  put on public-research, or non profit entities with pilot lines (like IMEC or CEA,
  or Fraunhofer) since - particularly IMEC - the commercial incentive is producing
  then a bias in competition terms on the market. Regarding priority the sector of
  photonic testing (where europe is strong) shall be architecture around a leadership
  test facilities with equipment makers. Not having an european outsourced assembly
  and test player ecosytem in Europe (and not a non european player installing factories)
  is always a worry vs. independence of supply.
