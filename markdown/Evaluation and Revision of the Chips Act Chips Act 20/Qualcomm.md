  Call for Evidence on the review of the Chips Act and supports the development of
  a more ambitious, innovation-driven Chips Act 2. The current Chips Act mobilized
  political attention and major investment, establishing semiconductors as a strategic
  priority for Europe. Yet implementation has revealed structural limitations that
  have to be addressed to strengthen Europes competitiveness, resilience, and technological
  sovereignty. The current focus on reaching 20% global manufacturing capacity by
  2030 has generated momentum but is unlikely to be met. Therefore, Europe should
  therefore complement production goals with innovation-oriented indicators, including
  design capability, R&D intensity, advanced packaging, IP generation, skilled workforce
  development, and leadership in AI, 5G/6G, edge computing and energy-efficient low-power
  processing. A key limitation of the existing framework is its emphasis on large-scale
  fabs. Europe has under-supported vital segments such as chip design, IP, EDA tools,
  advanced packaging, materials, equipment, and fabless companies. These areas are
  essential for technological sovereignty and represent domains where Europe can achieve
  global leadership. SMEs and start-ups, which drive much of semiconductor design
  innovation, face administrative barriers and limited access to funding and foundry
  capacity. Chips Act 2 should therefore broaden eligibility, simplify procedures,
  and ensure predictable access to manufacturing through structured public-private
  partnerships. To remain competitive, Europe must also address structural enablers:
  deployment of skilled engineers, affordable clean energy, reliable water, and critical
  raw materials. A dedicated European semiconductor skills programme is needed, including
  investment in STEM education, international mobility schemes, and collaborative
  research exchanges with trusted industrial partners. Stronger governance and coordination
  are essential for efficiency and impact. The role of the European Semiconductor
  Board should be reinforced, enabling it to coordinate strategy, permitting, and
  funding at EU level. A one-stop-shop for project approval would reduce fragmentation
  and increase legal certainty. Greater transparency of funding flows and outcomes
  is necessary to avoid duplication and ensure effective allocation of public resources.
  Qualcomm emphasizes the strategic importance of strengthening European chip design
  capabilities. Supporting open and secure design frameworks, including the RISC-V
  instruction set architecture, can reduce dependency on proprietary technologies
  and stimulate innovation, particularly in automotive, industrial, robotics, AI,
  and edge applications. Chips Act 2 should be integrated with Europes broader digital
  and industrial strategies, including AI, advanced connectivity, quantum technologies,
  sustainable digitalization and the green transition. Semiconductors underpin Europes
  ability to lead in these domains. A more holistic approach linking research, design,
  industrial deployment and cross-sector application would create stronger synergies
  and reinforce Europes global position. Qualcomm supports the strategic objectives
  set out by the Semicon Coalitionprosperity, indispensability, and resilienceand
  the alignment of national initiatives with EU-level instruments. Europe should measure
  success not only through manufacturing share, but through leadership in design,
  IP, specialized technologies, trusted supply chains, and sustainable semiconductor
  development. A future-proof Chips Act 2 should create a coherent, innovation-centred
  policy architecture that strengthens Europes position across the full semiconductor
  value chainfrom conception and design to deploymentwhile fostering open standards,
  trusted partnerships and long-term competitiveness.'

**Qualcomm’s response to the Call of evidence – Review of the (EU) Regulation 2023/1781 -**

**Chips Act**


**1. Introduction**


Qualcomm welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the European Commission’s review and
evaluation of the European Chips Act. As a global leader in wireless innovation, semiconductor
design, and system-on-chip (SoC) technologies, Qualcomm shares the European Union’s ambition
to strengthen its semiconductor ecosystem including fabrication, advanced packaging testing and
design, all of which are indispensable to enhance technological sovereignty, and foster resilience
in critical supply chains.


The adoption of the Chips Act in 2023 marked an important milestone, successfully mobilizing
political will and private investment to address Europe’s strategic dependence on global
semiconductor supply chains. However, the evolving technological and geopolitical landscape —
together with the joint declaration of all 27 Member States as the _Semicon Coalition_ on 29
September 2025 — demonstrates that the current framework must now evolve into a more
ambitious and integrated strategy, a “Chips Act 2.0”.


Europe’s economic competitiveness and security depend on semiconductors. In order to remain an
influential global actor at the forefront of innovation, the EU must not only scale its manufacturing
capacity and lead in the technologies that will define the next decade — artificial intelligence (AI),
advanced connectivity (6G), edge computing, and trusted low-power processing.


**2. Evaluation of the current Chips Act**


The initial implementation of the Chips Act sparked significant momentum and attracted
substantial investment - estimated at €80 billion - firmly establishing semiconductors as a strategic
pillar of the EU’s industrial and digital strategies. Yet the Regulation’s implementation has revealed
structural weaknesses that limit its effectiveness, efficiency, and long-term coherence.


The political goal of reaching 20% of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity by 2030 was
an important signal of intent, but progress to date on this goal has been limited. For the same 2030
timeframe, the European Court of Auditors projects a share closer to 11–12%, underlining the need
for measurable, realistic, and innovation-oriented indicators. Production goals should be
supplemented with additional indicators such as design capability, advancing packaging, testing,
and R&D intensity. The objective should not be to replace production metrics- Europe needs more
fabrication- but to ensure they are embedded within a comprehensive innovation strategy.

Moreover, by focusing primarily on large-scale fabs, the Regulation has neglected critical parts of
the semiconductor value chain — design, IP, EDA tools, packaging, materials, and equipment —
where Europe already holds or could develop strong expertise and a significant competitive
advantage.


In particular, IP design is a cornerstone of semiconductor innovation, enabling differentiated
architectures, energy efficiency, and performance optimization across applications. Europe’s
ability to foster a strong ecosystem for IP - including support for fabless companies, design houses,
and licensing models – is an important differentiator for the EU and is crucial to reducing reliance
on less trusted non-EU players and securing long-term technological sovereignty.


In addition, better coordination on national funding schemes, clearer subsidy rules, and streamlined
approving procedures will increase efficiencies and enhance legal certainty.


On another front, Europe should increase efforts to attract more skilled engineers, scale up the
deployment of affordable clean energy solutions, and secure access to critical raw materials to
strengthen its competitiveness in the semiconductor sector. At the same time, the Commission’s
visibility into total funding flows and their outcomes remains partial, limiting its ability to
effectively monitor progress and identify overlaps or inefficiencies across national programs.


Finally, the Regulation’s tools are still heavily skewed toward large-scale industrial players,
leaving SMEs, start-ups, and fabless innovators — key drivers of global semiconductor design and
IP development — with limited support from the program. To unlock their potential, the Regulation
should increase accessibility by reducing excessive paperwork and cutting red tape, ensuring these
innovators can fully contribute to strengthening Europe’s position in high-value segments of the
value chain.


**3. Qualcomm’s perspective**


As a fabless semiconductor company and a global leader in wireless, AI, and edge computing
technologies, Qualcomm plays a central role in the semiconductor design ecosystem. Qualcomm
develops advanced chipsets and IP portfolios powering 5G connectivity, leading the 6G
development, low-power AI processing, and secure computing platforms across smartphones,
automotive, industrial IoT, and other end markets. Since its founding in 1985, Qualcomm has
invested over 105 billion in R&D to develop these foundational and ground-breaking technologies.


Europe is an important partner for Qualcomm — a hub for research collaboration, a source for
advanced engineering talent, and a center for developing industrial applications. Qualcomm’s
interest in the Chips Act review lies in ensuring that Europe builds a predictable, innovationdriven, and globally competitive semiconductor ecosystem, spanning design, manufacturing, and

advanced R&D. To achieve this, addressing Europe’s skills gap is essential: Chips Act 2.0 should
include dedicated programs for talent development and international researcher exchanges,
building on global commitments with trusted partners (such as Qualcomm) to meet workforce
needs and sustain competitiveness across the semiconductor supply chain. In this context,
Qualcomm strongly supports the objectives set out in the German federal government’s
_Microelectronics Strategy 2025_ [1] notably the expansion of chip design capabilities, the
strengthening of advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration, and the acceleration of
technology transfer “from lab to fab” - are highly relevant to the broader evolution of the Chips
Act. These initiatives underscore the need for Europe to complement manufacturing support with
robust, design-led innovation ecosystems that connect research, development, and industrial
deployment. Enhanced coordination between national strategies, EU-level programs such as the
Chips Joint Undertaking, and industrial partnerships will be essential to leverage Europe’s
comparative strengths in research excellence, resources and trusted manufacturing.


The next phase of the Chips Act should also promote open and secure chip design frameworks,
with a focus on the support for the instruction set architecture RISC-V. Embedding “ _secure-by-_
_design_ ” principles, interoperability, and sustainability across these measures would strengthen
Europe’s technological sovereignty and ensure that semiconductor policy supports the full
innovation cycle — from conception to industrial realization — in alignment with the EU’s broader
economic security and digital competitiveness objectives. As an open standard, RISC-V enables
cost-effective, flexible, and customizable chip design, lowering barriers for SMEs and start-ups.
Its modular architecture allows tailored optimization for emerging workloads, including AI, IoT,
and edge computing, while promoting interoperability and energy efficiency. Global adoption of
RISC-V is accelerating rapidly, with other regions outside Europe designating significant resources
into RISC-V and major industry players integrating it into AI computing and automotive platforms.
By embedding support for open hardware standards such as RISC-V into Chips Act 2.0 as well as
further regulation, the EU should reduce dependency on proprietary architectures and position
Europe as a leader in RISC-V and next-generation semiconductor design for its strategic sectors
such as automotive, robotics, and energy.


A key challenge for the coming years will be to ensure effective alignment between EU level
strategy and national implementation. The success of a mature and competitive European chips

ecosystem depends on avoiding duplication, improving coherence between national programs, and
establishing strong enforcement and coordination mechanisms at the EU level. A single,
transparent governance framework — with clear visibility over funding flows, project outcomes,
and strategic priorities — would maximize efficiency and accountability across Member States.


In parallel, the future “Chips Act 2.0” should adopt a broader and more integrated innovation
agenda, recognizing that semiconductors underpin Europe’s ambitions in AI, advanced
connectivity, quantum, and green technologies. The Chips Act should therefore be closely linked
to initiatives such as the _EU Apply AI Strategy_ [2], the _AI Factories Plan_ [3], and the _Digital Europe_
_Programme_ [4], enabling cross-sector synergies and ensuring that Europe leads globally in the design
and deployment of intelligent, energy-efficient, and trustworthy computing systems.


Building on this strategic direction, Qualcomm considers that this review of the Chips Act offers
an opportunity to establish a more coherent, innovation-driven policy architecture at the European
level. By aligning national initiatives such as Germany’s _Microelectronics Strategy 2025_ with EUwide instruments, the EU can create a single, integrated framework that supports design
excellence, advanced R&D, and sustainable industrial capacity. Such alignment should ensure
predictability for investors, promote efficient use of public resources, and reinforce Europe’s
capacity to deliver trusted and energy-efficient semiconductors.


The recommendations set out below outline practical measures to shape a more coherent and
innovation-driven “Chips Act 2.0.”


Finally, Qualcomm welcomes the goals expressed by the Semicon Coalition declaration as well,
which calls for a revision of the Chips Act to “ _strengthen and revitalize Europe’s position in the_
_global semiconductor industry_ . [5] ”


The Coalition’s three strategic objectives - prosperity, indispensability, and resilience - provide a
clear roadmap for Chips Act 2.0:


  - **Prosperity:** Build a competitive semiconductor ecosystem that generates long-term
economic value through innovation, design leadership, and industrial excellence.

  - **Indispensability:** Secure Europe’s leadership at critical points of the semiconductor value
chain, including design, materials, packaging, and specialized applications such as AI and
communications.


  - **Resilience:** Ensure a stable and trustworthy chip supply for Europe’s critical industries,
supported by diversified global partnerships and sustainable infrastructure.


These objectives align with Qualcomm’s conviction that Europe’s strength lies in its capacity for
innovation, while increasing production capacity remains equally important. The EU should
measure success by leadership in advanced design, IP generation, and specialized, high-value
technologies - in addition to wafer share and production of semiconductors across all node sizes.


**4. Recommendations for a “Chips Act 2.0”**


From Qualcomm’s standpoint, a revised Chips Act should take a more holistic and innovationdriven approach:


❖ **Supplement goals and metrics:** supplement production-volume targets with innovation
based indicators — including R&D investment and intensity, cutting-edge design
capability, IP creation, high-skilled semiconductor workforce development, and leadership
in emerging domains such as AI, 5G/6G, edge computing, and secure low-power SoCs.
❖ **Support the full semiconductor value chain:** funding should extend beyond fabrication

to include design ecosystems, prototyping, software-hardware co-design, packaging,
materials, and equipment. Fabless companies must have predictable access to foundry
capacity in Europe through structured public-private partnerships.
❖ **Simplify** **governance** **and** **regulation:** empowering the existing **European**
**Semiconductor Board** (“ **ESB** ”) to coordinate EU-level strategy, permitting, and funding,
moving beyond its current advisory role to become a driver of integrated decision-making.
Introducing a one-stop-shop for project approval to harmonize criteria across Member
States and accelerate strategic investments, ensuring industry-wide alignment and reducing
administrative complexity.
❖ **Investing in skills:** launch a new European chips skills program to boost programs such

as STEM education and training [6] and to incentivize international talent mobility.
❖ **Invest in infrastructure:** Improve access to clean energy, reliable water supply, and

critical raw materials through better EU coordination and strategic trade partnerships.

leveraging Europe’s strong industrial base to lead in applying AI at the edge —enabling
scalable AI deployment across industries—while laying the groundwork for the future rollout of 6G **.**


**Conclusion**


The European Chips Act has laid out the groundwork for a stronger semiconductor ecosystem. To
further increase its impact in a rapidly evolving global industry, the framework of this Regulation
has to be shaped into a more innovative-led strategy. Chips Act 2.0 should again set a strong focus
on scaling production capacity but also establish the institutional coherence, coordination, and
accountability necessary to align EU-level objectives with national implementation. This
alignment is essential to avoid duplication, ensure efficient allocation of public resources, and
maximize Europe’s collective technological potential.


Chips Act 2.0 should embrace a broader innovation agenda, recognizing that semiconductors
underpin Europe’s ambitions in AI, advanced connectivity, quantum computing, and sustainable
digitalization. By integrating the Chips Act with initiatives such as the _EU Apply AI Strateg_ y, the

_AI Factories_ Plan and the _Digital Europe Programme_ and broader sustainability and
decarbonization goals, Europe can ensure that semiconductor policy can support Europe’s position
in key technology areas.


Through coordinated governance, design-led innovation, and international cooperation grounded
in open strategic autonomy, Europe can position itself not merely as a manufacturing hub, but as
a global leader in semiconductor conception, design, and deployment.


To achieve this, Chips Act 2.0 should go beyond symbolic targets and focus on the core strengths
that make Europe competitive: innovation, diversification, design leadership, trusted supply
chains, sustainability and education. The goal should be not only to manufacture semiconductors
in Europe, but also to lead within a broader framework - from conception and design to smart
integration across all sectors of the economy. In this context, embracing open standards such as
RISC‑V is strategically vital, as it fosters innovation, reduces dependency on proprietary
architectures, and enables Europe to shape global norms while accelerating ecosystem
development.


Qualcomm looks forward to continued engagement with the European Commission and is pleased
to contribute to this important dialogue.
