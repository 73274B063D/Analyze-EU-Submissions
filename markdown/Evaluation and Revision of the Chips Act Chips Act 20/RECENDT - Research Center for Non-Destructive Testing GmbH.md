feedback: We noticed an increasing demand in semiconductor metrology in general and
  in particular for high aspect ratio structures, ultra-thin films and 3D-stacks.
  However, no appropriate funding instruments were implemented in the last Chips Act.
  Generally, the Chips Act did not serve as a supporting instrument to bring novel
  supporting- & enabling-technologies to practical application, like, e.g. photonic
  measurement technologies in the field of NDT, metrology, characterization, monitoring
  & sensing. There should be dedicated budget streams reserved to invite RTOs to implement
  and demonstrate novel supporting- & enabling-technologies in the fab. Especially,
  the transfer from lab to fab shall be enabled for photonic metrology, testing, monitoring,
  sensing and characterization technologies - for wafer-level processes or for chip-level
  structures.
