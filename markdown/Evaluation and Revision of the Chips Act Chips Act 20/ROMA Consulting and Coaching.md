The first European Chips Act is vital in boosting Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem by expanding
research and innovation capacity; supporting manufacturing through targeted funding;
strengthening supply-chain resilience; enabling the access for SMEs to design and production
infrastructure; and establishing a coordinated crisis-response system.


**Workforce and skills are essential**


It should be emphasized that semiconductor workforce development is an essential part of the
equation: technical staff is urgently needed, not only in process technology development and in
manufacturing, but equally in system and architecture development and in chip design.


**Problem statement**


Technical job postings are growing at worrisome rates, but the supply of graduates is stagnating or at best growing modestly - and the resulting talent gap is becoming a primary challenge for
Europe’s semiconductor sector.


The “Skills Strategy 2024” report from the European Chip Skills Academy (ECSA) project has
estimated the semiconductor workforce gap in Europe by 2030 at 75,000 workers - aggregated
over technicians, hardware engineers and software/data specialists. This results from a gap
between the projected job openings (approx. 205,000) and the supply of graduates entering the
semiconductor sector (approx. 130,000). This forecasted European talent gap was based on
actually reported expansion and investment projects. It is to be noted that the stated goal of
expanding Europe’s share of global semiconductor production capacity to 20% has not been
taken into account in the projections. The 2025 update of the ECSA Skills Strategy recently revised
the talent gap downwards, as a result of postponed or cancelled investment projects; still it
estimates the European talent gap by 2030 at 65,000 workers.


**Action lines and different time horizons**


We distinguish 3 major action lines addressing the semiconductor workers’ pipeline:


a. Growing the STEM talent pool, targeting youngsters in elementary school and high school

(time horizon to the job market: 10–15 years)
b. Growing the student population in STEM domains, targeting students in university and

higher technical education (time horizon to the job market: 5–10 years)
c. Growing the influx of workers in semiconductor companies (time horizon to the job market:

1–5 years).


The actions and the outcome of the sequential workstreams are interdependent: growing the
interest for STEM in the early-age school population is mandatory for a growing STEM student
population in high schools and university/vocational education and training (VET), which in turn is
imperative in building a larger “pipeline” of candidate-employees for companies and research
organisations.


But it is important to notice that if we trust the time horizon of 2030 – which is only 4 years away –
for the talent gap predictions, “growing the influx in semiconductor companies” is the most urgent
workstream and adequate action lines will have to be compellingly implemented (e.g. through
adult education, reskilling, talent-driven mobility, …).


**Fragmented and uncoordinated actions**


Many workforce-related initiatives have existed – and still exist – under various EC programmes
(Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, ERASMUS+ …). Most if not all current or planned workforce
initiatives make a valuable contribution to at least one aspect of growing the semiconductor
workers’ pipeline. But they remain fragmented and lack overall coordination and governance: a
coordinating body with sufficiently large authority, outlining an _integrated_ approach and setting
clear KPIs for the various action lines is missing.


The number of additional workers or students on the “demand side” should be quantified clearly
and set along a specific timeline. The actions on the “supply side” (undertaken or being planned)
should be classified according to a timeline (short-term, medium-term and long-term effect); to
resources required (budget, staff, infrastructure); and to impact (e.g. number of additional
students registered; number of workers reskilled or hired).


One of the promising components of the “Chips for Europe Initiative” pillar of the Chips Act
concerns the establishment of a network of chips competence centres (CCCs): these recently
established CCCs are expected to become regional antennas and a.o. poles for development of
new talent. On the positive side, it is important to notice that for the first time in an EC research
programme on microelectronics the build-up of technology and chip-making capacity is
addressed, _concurrently_ with building the human capital to enable it.


The CCCs hold promise but the initiative is still being established and it is too early to assess their
merit. And in spite of the formation of a network among the local CCCs and the existence of a
“Coordination and Support Action” to support this network, a proper governance needs to be
ensured: the CCCs need to become _strategic_ actors in a coherent European semiconductor
ecosystem.


**Recommendations for Chips Act 2.0**

After a plethora of well-intended projects which often did not quite meet the ambitious objectives,
it is time to think and act strategically in terms of skills and workforce development. Our
recommendations to support this endeavour under the Chips Act 2.0 are summarised as follows:


1. The EC needs to set up a “ **Chips Skills Council** ” as a high-level body within the governance

structure of the Chips JU – at an equal level as the European Semiconductor Board –
dedicated to semiconductor skills and workforce development, (i) with adequate
representation from all involved stakeholders (i.e. EC, Member States, industry, RTOs and the
education providers); (ii) which develops a master plan and sets KPIs for the various
workstreams; (iii) which monitors on a regular basis the progress and updates/refines the
needs and means in a changing landscape; and (iv) which is endowed with sufficient
authority to influence key actors and to facilitate decisions.

2. A “skills observatory” has been introduced in various projects, but this typically has a

temporary horizon (due to the limited duration of the projects) and with little or no “operating
power” w.r.t. assuring the necessary support, or gathering the data for the demand side and
the supply side of skills. It is therefore recommended to install a permanent Semiconductor
Skills Observatory at EU level, that operates intimately with the Chips Skills Council, (i) with
representatives from all major stakeholders (from demand and supply side); and (ii) that is


given sufficient authority to collect on a regular basis fine-grained data from supply and
demand side.


3. The various Ministries of Education throughout Europe should be held responsible for

contributing to the Semiconductor Skills Observatory by providing, on a regular basis, data
for the student population in secondary, higher and adult education, which should allow (i)
recommendations to be issued and (ii) steering and corrective actions to be taken, wherever
and whenever needed.


4. Women are disappointingly underrepresented among graduates in STEM studies and

careers. The two major ‘drop-off points’ for girls/women in European tech are (i) at the end of
secondary education; and (ii) at the workforce entrance with a tertiary education degree. This
signals a serious and multifaceted problem of Europe’s STEM education and career paths. It
calls for a comprehensive, multi-level and integrated approach that encompasses
educational reforms, policy interventions, societal attitude shifts and targeted support
mechanisms to effectively bridge the gap.


5. The cost of state-of-the-art laboratories and clean rooms at educational institutions is

becoming prohibitively high. Government agencies need to stimulate and adequately
support RTOs, education providers and industry to jointly and effectively (i) establish
authoritative roadmaps, aimed at scaling up workforce training and development for hightech industries; (ii) agree on joint programmes aimed at bridging the gap between academic
curricula and industry needs; and (iii) grow the cohort of experts with an industry mindset
(e.g. through internships; dual learning initiatives...).

6. It is strongly advised that all stakeholders devote workforce development efforts involving

sufficiently large resources in the local regions with high growth needs and a thriving talent
ecosystem (mimicking e.g. the Brainport region in The Netherlands). The CCCs will
undoubtedly be able to support these regional activities and they are expected to share
expertise and exchange best practices. But we advocate to follow the principle “think global,
act local”: the CCCs are regional operators, but it is recommended that they are monitored
and coordinated from a supra-regional level, in agreement with an overall European
semiconductor strategy.


**Conclusion**


Under the Chips Act 2.0 skills and workforce development need to move to the top of the agenda
of Europe’s decision makers: it is time for a moonshot Chips Skills Project.
