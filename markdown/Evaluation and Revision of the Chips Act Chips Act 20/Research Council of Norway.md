feedback: '----1)Predictability of Pillar I Calls Requiring National Co-Funding: Predictability
  in Pillar I calls that require national co-funding is essential for National Funding
  Authorities. To ensure effective participation, new calls should not be introduced
  as amendments to annual work programmes during the year. National budget processes
  are inherently slow, and when national funding is unavailable, relevant national
  actors are prevented from participating. ----2) Chips Competence Centres: Objectives
  and Challenges: The primary objective of Chips Competence Centres is to build expertise
  and support SMEs in utilizing pilot lines, design platforms, and related chips technologies.
  However, current State-aid rules restrict the transfer of competence from the Competence
  Centres to third-party SMEs. ----3) Pre-Commercial Procurement for Pilot Lines:
  Chips JU should consider implementing Pre-Commercial Procurement for acquiring semiconductor
  manufacturing equipment for pilot lines. Europe already has significant strengths
  in this area and supporting SMEs with new technologies as they approach market entry
  is crucial for maintaining competitiveness. ----4) Norway''s Participation and Eligibility
  in Chips JU Calls: Norway is associated with the Horizon Europe and Digital programmes
  and is an EEA-EFTA country. It is important to ensure that Norwegian actors are
  eligible in all future Chips JU calls. ----5) Marked pull initiatives: While Chips
  Act 1.0 has commendably focused on the development of technology and infrastructure
  for pilot lines without having a clear strategy on their commercial use, we believe
  that to truly maximize the benefits of this investment, Chips Act 2.0 should introduce
  demand driven market pull initiatives. By introducing demand-driven market pull
  initiatives, Europe can not only strengthen its existing industrial base but also
  enhance its global competitiveness. This approach will stimulate innovation and
  drive the commercial application of new technologies, ensuring that investments
  result in tangible economic benefits both within Europe and in international markets.'
