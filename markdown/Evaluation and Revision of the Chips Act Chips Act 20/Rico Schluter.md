feedback: 'The European Chip Act on itself was good initiative and showing already
  nice result as beside EU funding, also already it attracted in a few years billions
  of third parties investments. But by just funding Chip / Semiconductor industry
  it will not reduce reliance on Asia in full meaning. To build solid resilience in
  Europe for these formerly named industries, all supply chain should considered,
  especially PCB and EMS. 1. Customs duty European PCB manufacturers must pay customs
  duty on base materials that they import. These are not produced in the EU in the
  required variety or quantity. At the same time, however, PCBs ordered and produced
  in China and imported into the EU are exempt from customs duties. This very unfair
  competition and killing our own European PCB industry that is already for years
  now under heavy pressure. To reduce this competitive disadvantage, base materials
  for PCB production must be exempt from customs duties. This involves the following
  customs tariff numbers: - 7410210090 - copper clad laminates (duty rate: 5.2%) -
  3921905590 rolls of epoxy resin impregnated glass fibres (prepregs) (6.5%) - 70197300000
  - FR4 prepreg (5.0%) - 74091900000 - copper clad epoxy impregnated glass fabric(4.8%)
  - 7410 1100 400 - copper clad simple laminates (5.2%) - 70196100290 -non-clad laminate
  (7.0%). 2. Incentives to support PCB industry In 2021, the US agreed on the H.R.4346
  - CHIPS and Science Act This act is providing $52,7 billion in manufacturing grants
  and research investments and establish a 25% investment tax credit (ITC) to incentivize
  semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. As this act is only supporting semi-conductor
  / chip industry, also in 2022 established the supporting PCB act : H.R.7677 - Supporting
  American Printed Circuit Boards Act of 2022. This bill provides incentives to bolster
  domestic printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing, research, and development to
  reduce supply chain disruptions, address national security concerns related to foreign
  PCB production, and enhance America''s economic leadership. The bill establishes
  a financial assistance program modelled on the CHIPS Act within the Commerce Department
  for American facilities manufacturing or researching PCBs; provides a 25% tax credit
  for entities that purchase American manufactured PCBs; requires a Presidential determination
  for single financial awards over $300 million; includes waste, fraud, and abuse
  protections; and authorizes appropriations of $3 billion to carry out the program.
  In Europe, the EU started with European Chip act, 43 billion to support the European
  Chip / Semiconductor Industry up to 2030. But everyone is forgetting that for Semiconductor
  as well as Chips, you always need to have a PCB as a carrier. It doesn''t make sense
  to spend billions of Euros for European Chip Act and still buying the PCB to mount
  the device on from China, especially not for critical industry sectors like Aerospace,
  Defence and Security. 3. Intellectual Property Still, for defence and security,
  aerospace and avionics as well as industrial automation and medical industry, Europe
  has a growing demand for high-end PCB''s. Companies that buy PCB in China urgently
  have to consider that when sending over Gerber files ( digital PCB production files
  ), it is extremely easy to copy them. Most politicians and also majority of the
  companies that ordering in China have absolutely no clue about what is going on
  in China and for sure are not aware of the risk sending digital data to Chinese
  manufacturers. Just 2 reminders from the Communist Party 30 year plan : - Deploying
  the world''s best-armed forces no later than 2049. - Become global IOT leader by
  2035 So in the European PCB industry, there is a strong suspect that digital PCB
  production data are copied in a massive way when produced in Chinese factories.'
