**Robert Bosch GmbH Position Paper**


**on the European Commission's "Chips Act" Consultation**


**Introduction: Completing the European Semiconductor Building**


The European Union's semiconductor strategy is at a critical juncture. The initial Chips Act was a
necessary and largely successful step towards strengthening Europe's position in the global
semiconductor landscape. However, as the envisioned 20% EU market share goal remains
unmet, it is clear that a successful EU semiconductor policy requires a more comprehensive
approach. The challenge lies not in a failure of the initial Act itself, but in the need to broaden its
scope. To truly secure Europe's future in this vital sector, we must complete the semiconductor
"building," completing it with additional elements rather than the existing three pillars alone. This
position paper outlines our recommendations for strengthening and expanding the Chips Act 2,
ensuring a robust and resilient European semiconductor ecosystem.


**Chips Act in a Larger Policy and Semiconductor Strategy Context**


A comprehensive EU semiconductor strategy must integrate industrial policy, business models
and financing tools, as well as sovereignty considerations. Beyond the current Chips Act's three
pillars of R&D, investment support, and crisis management, we advocate for additional
foundational elements: a robust regulatory and business environment, effective semiconductor
demand generation Europe, and the robust involvement of third-party private capital and venture
capital. A successful strategy must prioritize risk mitigation, including public sourcing, increase
of European semiconductor content, incentivized, e.g., through cost compensation (OPEX),
secure raw material access, alongside continuous risk monitoring and awareness. Standards
may also play a role in this holistic framework.


**1. Research and Development (Pillar 1)**


Europe's R&D efforts are fundamental to its long-term competitiveness. R&D for the strategic
semiconductor field must be sufficiently financed by the upcoming ECF and HEU, however the
Chips Act offers a critical and targeted additional funding source, including capital investments
in R&D. We recommend the following:


  - **Unified Governance and Industry Involvement:** Maintain governance under the Chips
Joint Undertaking (JU), but unify fragmented programs like "Chips for Europe" and "ECS."
Crucially, industry stakeholders must be granted full voting rights to ensure alignment
with market needs and technological realities.


  - **Industry-Led Program Development:** Stakeholders close to the market (industry,
consortia, SME, Start-ups) need to be consulted _before_ establishing new R&D investment
programs, such as pilot lines and design centers. This ensures that investments are
strategically directed towards areas of highest impact and relevance.


  - **Integrating Resilience into R&D:** The concept of resilience should be explicitly
embedded within R&D strategies, fostering innovation that addresses potential supply
chain disruptions and strengthens Europe's self-sufficiency, especially in the field of rawmaterial dependency and topics concerning safety, security and defense.


**2. Investment (Pillar 2)**


Strategic investment is paramount for building critical capacities. The "first-of-a-kind" (FOAK)
criterion could remain as a core principle, encompassing both leading-edge and legacy chips.
We suggest complementing FOAK with a "sovereignty" criterion. This would prioritize investments
that enhance value chain resilience or demonstrably serve local demand, thereby strengthening
Europe's strategic autonomy


  - **Strengthening Foundational Semiconductors:** The existing industrial base and
technologies, particularly in "foundational semiconductors" or "legacy chips," are vital.
The Chips Act must continue to support their innovation and production, addressing also
upstream supply, fabless business models, and chip design to foster a complete
ecosystem and a strong European position in a global context.


  - **Addressing Advanced Chip Manufacturing:** While "advanced" (<10nm) chip
manufacturing in Europe is a legitimate political objective, it requires novel approaches.
This necessitates addressing European demand, facilitating chip design, technology
transfer, joint ventures, and robust supply-chain partnerships, alongside innovative
business and financing models.


Alongside grants, we strongly advocate for considering tax incentives as an additional, lowoverhead mechanism to stimulate investment, thereby increasing the attractiveness of Europe
as a manufacturing hub.


**3. Monitoring and Crisis Management (Pillar 3)**


Effective monitoring and crisis management are vital for mitigating future supply chain
disruptions. Measures in this pillar must be pragmatic and avoid undue administrative burden on
European companies.


  - **Establishing a "Chips Office":** We endorse the establishment of a dedicated "Chips
Office" within the European Commission, fostering a permanent build-up of expertise in
chip technology, markets, and trade rules. This entity could closely interact with the
emerging Industry Advisory Group, which would serve as a crucial interface for strategic
dialogue with industry regarding risk management and strategy development.


  - **Trust-Based Information Exchange:** Forced or formalized information gathering is less
effective than a trust-based dialogue. Reducing administrative burden is key to making
the EU an attractive investment location. Any new measures or reporting obligations
should not impose additional administrative burdens on European companies, which
could detract from their competitiveness and investment in the EU


  - **Contractual Obligations for Crisis Measures:** The current labeling procedures (IPF,
OEF) should be discontinued as they add administrative burden without contributing
transparently to the Chips Act's goals. Obligations related to crisis supply, preferred
supply, trusted manufacturing, or crisis capacity should be agreed upon on an individual
contractual basis and compensated accordingly and be limited to national security
requirements.


**4. Governance, Finance, and Administration**


Transparent, efficient, and swift administrative procedures are critical for successful
implementation.


  - **EU Fund for Financing:** An expansion or replacement of financing sources by an EU fund
is advisable only if it provides additional funds, accelerates decision-making processes,
and reduces administrative overhead.


  - **Streamlined Administrative Procedures:** All administrative procedures, especially for
FOAK facilities, must be made more transparent, simpler to access, faster to process,
and implemented more swiftly. Clear timelines for permitting, as demonstrated, e.g., in
the Net-Zero Industry Act, are essential for long-term planning and legal certainty for


**5. Framework Conditions ("Foundation and Roof over Pillars")**


To realize Europe's semiconductor ambitions, fundamental boundary conditions must be
established:


  - **Attractive Investment Location:** Europe must become a highly attractive location for
semiconductor investments. This requires low energy costs, reliable and swift permit
processes, and reasonable, predictable legislation concerning PFAS, CO2 emissions,
and other economical factors.


  - **Promote Public Local Sourcing:** Governments should actively promote local
semiconductor sourcing in public procurement, particularly for defense, critical
infrastructure, automotive, health/medical, data hosting, and data centers. This could be
a visible sign and implementable measure to increase semiconductor demand from the
EU, which in turn will make investments in local design and manufacturing more
attractive.


  - **Incentivize Private Local Sourcing:** Incentives must be provided to private entities to
increase local semiconductor sourcing, effectively equalizing cost differences (Opex,
e.g., arising from energy, personnel, and tariffs) in order to generate European demand.


  - **Secure Supply Chains:** Governments must play a proactive role in securing supply
chains, particularly for cross-industry dependencies and where it is beyond the
capabilities of individual enterprises. This includes ensuring access to raw materials,
fostering international partnerships, and pursuing bilateral trade agreements.


By addressing these critical areas, the European Union can move beyond the foundational Chips
Act 1 and truly complete the "building" of a robust, resilient, and competitive European
semiconductor ecosystem, securing its strategic freedom-to-act in the digital age.


**Conclusion**


At Bosch we remain available for further dialogue and support on the future design and structure
of the European Chips Act 2.0 priorities and objectives.
