feedback: The European Chips Act marked a bold and timely response to these challenges.
  By combining strategic investment, publicprivate cooperation, and a coordinated
  policy framework, the Act has already mobilised significant resources to strengthen
  Europes semiconductor ecosystem and reduce its exposure to external shocks. Its
  ambition to make Europe a global hub for innovation, design, and advanced manufacturing
  was both visionary and necessary. Yet, the implementation of the Chips Act also
  reveals the complexity of translating ambition into lasting impact. To fully realise
  its potential, the policy must evolve to reflect new market dynamics as well as
  geo-political realities, ensure coherence across industrial and technological strategies,
  industrialisation of R&D projects, reduced administrative burden and create an environment
  that encourages both domestic innovation and international investment. It is important
  to build on Europes strong foundations with pragmatic reforms that enhance efficiency,
  inclusiveness, and competitiveness. By aligning policy instruments, deepening cooperation
  with industry, and maintaining openness to global partnerships, Europe can secure
  its place at the forefront of semiconductor innovation and ensure that its technological
  sovereignty is rooted in strength, collaboration, and long-term competitiveness.

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 2 | 5 6


Semiconductors are the foundation of the modern digital economy. They power
everything from smartphones, electric vehicles, and medical devices to the data centres
and supercomputers that enable artificial intelligence and advanced research. In an
increasingly interconnected and technologically driven world, secure and resilient
access to semiconductors has become not only an industrial priority but a strategic
imperative.


Over the past few years, the global semiconductor landscape has evolved rapidly,
shaped by geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, and unprecedented technological
progress. These shifts have underscored both the opportunities and vulnerabilities that
define Europe’s position in the global value chain. While Europe remains a world leader
in equipment, materials, and research, its share of global chip manufacturing has fallen
over the past two decades, exposing critical dependencies on foreign production.


The European Chips Act marked a bold and timely response to these challenges. By
combining strategic investment, public–private cooperation, and a coordinated policy
framework, the Act has already mobilized significant resources to strengthen Europe’s
semiconductor ecosystem and reduce its exposure to external shocks. Its ambition to
make Europe a global hub for innovation, design, and advanced manufacturing was both
visionary and necessary.


Yet, the implementation of the Chips Act also reveals the complexity of translating
ambition into lasting impact. To fully realize its potential, the policy must evolve to reflect
new market dynamics as well as geo-political realities, ensure coherence across
industrial and technological strategies, and create an environment that encourages both
domestic innovation and international investment.


In our 30 SEMI recommendations for a Chips Act 2.0 we underline that it is important to
build on Europe’s strong foundations with pragmatic reforms that enhance efficiency,
inclusiveness, and competitiveness. By aligning policy instruments, deepening
cooperation with industry, and maintaining openness to global partnerships, Europe can
secure its place at the forefront of semiconductor innovation and ensure that its
technological sovereignty is rooted in strength, collaboration, and long-term
competitiveness.

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 5 | 5 6


The European Chips Act, which has been in force since September 2023, had been a landmark
legislation for the semiconductor industry in Europe. This unprecedented political effort by the
European Union (EU) was spurred by the global chip shortage that took place as a result of the
supply chain disruptions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The chip shortage
experienced in the aftermath of the pandemic highlighted the significant strategic dependencies
and supply chain vulnerabilities of the EU’s key manufacturing industries (Automotive, medical
technologies, telecommunications, machinery and robotics), thereby leaving the EU overly
reliant on foreign chips and excessively exposed to unpredictable exogenous factors
(Geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, pandemics and climate crises).


For these reasons, the EU drafted a European Chips Act that could support technological
capacity building and innovation in the EU, attract investments and enhance production capacity
in semiconductor manufacturing and in advanced test, assembly and packaging (ATP).


The Chips Act has been instrumental in reinforcing the EU’s capabilities in the sphere of
semiconductors, bringing up to €45.2 billion in public and private investments, notably for
manufacturing capacity investments (Pillar II) with the approval of six First-of-a-Kind (FOAK)
semiconductor facilities. It has also implemented an ambitious pilot line framework (Pillar I) to
further strengthen the EU’s research and development (R&D) capabilities. As of October 2025,
**the European Chips Act has catalysed a total of €69 billion in public and private investments,**
powering new research and manufacturing capacity across Europe, and positioning the EU as the
**third-largest global destination for semiconductor investments** [1] .


While the 2023 European Chips Act was a great step towards mobilising investments in
semiconductor manufacturing and R&D activities, a second Chips Act – “Chips Act 2.0” – will
need to capitalise upon these successes, and **support the entire semiconductor supply chain**
**in Europe, from R&D and design to materials, equipment and components, back-end and**
**front-end manufacturing.** A well-functioning supply chain will be essential to sustain the EU’s
Chips Act ambitions, particularly with regards to advanced capabilities and resilience.

## **I.1     Scope and Methodology**


SEMI Europe, the industry association **representing 3,500+ companies globally and 300+**
**companies in Europe** from the entire semiconductor supply chain, has undertaken an extensive
consultation among its member companies to provide an in-depth assessment of the Chips Act
implementation, and to outline concrete policy recommendations ahead the publication of the
upcoming Chips Act 2.0.

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 6 | 5 6


For this crucial endeavour, SEMI Europe has conducted a significant information-gathering
exercise, consisting of the following key elements:


**SEMI Europe Survey** deployed across entire membership.
**Bilateral interviews** with representatives from leading research and technology

organisations, companies operating across the semiconductor value chain, including
chip design and design tools, materials and components suppliers, equipment makers,
back-end and front-end semiconductor manufacturers and innovative startups.
**Three in-depth Chips Act workshops** with member companies and research and

technology organisations (RTOs).


In total, input from **more than 60 companies and organisations** contributed to the development
of this report. This group includes 44 European companies and 17 non-EU–headquartered
companies, comprising 4 start-ups, 20 SMEs, and 37 large enterprises. The sample represents
actors from across the entire semiconductor value chain: 9 public and private entities active in
research, 5 in design, 14 materials suppliers, 16 equipment suppliers, and 9 front-end and backend manufacturers, including 5 European and non-European IDMs. The picture is further
complemented by contributions from independent experts, trade associations, and EU
government agencies.


The extensive information that was gathered in the aforementioned process has been
consolidated into the **SEMI Europe Chips Act Report** to provide a comprehensive overview of
the Chips Act, with the aim of assessing the Chips Act implementation and its impact on the
European semiconductor ecosystem, and proposing concrete policy recommendations for a
Chips Act 2.0 that supports the entire semiconductor supply chain in Europe.


SEMI Europe kindly invites all policymakers and industry stakeholders involved in the revision of
the Chips Act to carefully consider the assessments, observations and policy recommendations
presented in this document.


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 7 | 5 6


The objectives established in the Chips Act were primarily defined to tackle long-lasting supply
chain vulnerabilities of the European Union and to strengthen Europe’s research, innovation and
industrial capacities in the sector. Accordingly, SEMI Europe respondent members (100%) deem
it appropriate to strengthen Europe’s technology leadership by reinforcing its innovation
capacities in all segments of the semiconductor supply chain, in order to overcome current
global challenges. On average, **87% of SEMI Europe respondent members agree with the**
**general objectives of the Chips Act and 77% consider that they can be achieved in the**
**medium and long-term.** These results exclude the Digital Decade target to achieve a 20% share
of global production capacity by 2030, which is deemed unachievable by 90% of SEMI **Europe**
**respondent members** and endorsed by only 13% of them. The support from the semiconductor
industry that is expressed here, representing public and private organisations and companies
from all segments of the supply chain, is to be read as a statement of support for the end-goals
of the Chips Act.


Thus, **96% of SEMI Europe respondent members endorse the goal to develop next generation**
**chip production,** bringing large-scale innovation and critical technologies via pilot lines publicprivate investments. However, fears remain that the lack of integration of the European Chips Act
with relevant third-policy initiatives dedicated to AI, quantum, mobility, energy and defence,
among others, will not coordinate future supply and demand for semiconductors in Europe.


If the supply and demand of advanced semiconductor technologies do not align, the Chips Act
will bring limited benefits to the EU. So far, **the lack of market demand is the primary concern**
**of SEMI Europe respondent members when exploring the possibility of investing in Europe**
and building new facilities. The market uncertainties revolving around the European market have
disincentivised companies to invest in Europe. Equally, impediments to the uptake of pilot lines’
results, the limited attractiveness of the Chips Act’s state aid framework compared to similar
programs in third countries and the lack of a holistic support towards the entire semiconductor
supply chain require the EU to adjust its policy approach.


SEMI Europe widely support the structure and objectives of the Chips Act. However, **its**
**execution and numerous structural challenges will limit its success** and its spillover benefits
for Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem. The EU has designed a good and coherent policy tool in
a time of emergency where a quick response was required. At this point in time, the EU should
build upon the strengths of the first Chips Act, enhancing its framework and offering adequate
framework conditions for the emergence of a strong semiconductor ecosystem in Europe.

## **1.1. Two Years On: Chips Act Investments’ State of Play**


The Chips Act was adopted with the stated objective of unlocking total investments of €86 billion
towards the European semiconductor industry by 2030. Half of this amount was planned to
originate from public funding, combining a €4.5 billion budget line from EU funding programmes


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 8 | 5 6


(Ex. Horizon Europe and Digital Europe Programme), €35.3 billion in state aid from Member
States, €1.4 billion from other EU funding programmes and €2.1 billion in equity support. The
remaining half of the investments (€43 billion) were expected to be leveraged from private
investments from semiconductor companies and research organisations [2] .


Approved semiconductor investments and funding in Europe have come under three main
streams: **€21.8 billion** under the _Important Project of Common European Interest_ (IPCEI) ME-CT,
**€5.1 billion** for R&D pilot lines and **€53.8 billion** in confirmed/pending public–private
investments for _First-of-a-Kind_ (FOAK) and non-FOAK facilities. An additional funding of **€150**
**million** for other related projects were approved by the Chips Joint Undertaking (Chips JU). It
should be noted that part of the IPCEI ME-CT investments, about **€12 billion**, are also included in
the FOAK stream, reflecting overlapping project scopes.


Overall, as of October 2025, two years since the final adoption of the _Chips Act_, the initiative has
**catalysed €69 billion across R&D projects and facility investments in Europe** **[3]** **.**

### _1.1.1. IPCEIs_


IPCEIs are transnational projects whereby EU Member States are allowed to provide state aid to
projects that are highly strategic, innovative and cross-border in scope [4] . Characterised by their
large-scale nature, IPCEIs involve public and private actors via collaborative projects that
address major market failures in critical supply chains and compensate their associated risks
(Technological and financial) [5] .


Accordingly, in June 2023, 14 Member States adopted the **IPCEI on Microelectronics and**
**Communication Technologies (ME-CT), bringing together 56 companies in 68 projects** **[6]** **.** The
IPCEI ME-CT represents a total investment of €21.8 billion, €8.1 billion leveraged by private
investments and the remaining €13.7 billion provided via state aid. The joint programme supports
R&D projects covering the entire semiconductor supply chain, from materials and chip design to
manufacturing and end-user integration (Ex. 5G / 6G, autonomous driving, AI and quantum).


Following this considerable IPCEI, the largest to date, **15 Member States started to elaborate**
**the next IPCEI on Advanced Semiconductor Technologies (AST).** This initiative will focus on
the development of next-generation semiconductor technologies with a focus on AI, quantum,
advanced packaging, photonics and power electronics, to support Europe’s critical end-user
industries. The level of public funding and private investment remains to be confirmed as Member
States are now identifying relevant projects and actors that could be included in this next IPCEI.

### _1.1.2. Pilot Lines_

Pilot lines are research and development (R&D) projects aiming to develop cutting-edge and
next-generation semiconductor technologies in Europe. Pilot lines, falling under Pillar I of the
Chips Act, are financially supported by the Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programme
together with public-private investments [7] . Since the adoption of the text, **9 pilot line projects**
**have been approved for a total of €4.8 billion,** where €3.7 billion are provided from EU funding
programmes and complemented by a €1.1 billion investment.


The following pilot line projects have been approved or are currently being discussed under Pillar
I of the Chips Act:


**5 pilot lines on leading-edge semiconductors and related technologies** from 10nm to

2nm, advanced packaging, wide-bandgap semiconductors and advanced photonics.

**4 joint pilot lines** between the EU and South Korea.

**6 pilot lines for quantum technologies** with a funding of €50 million each.


This raises the total level of investments towards pilot line projects up to €5.1 billion, with approx.
€4 billion funded from the EU budget and a €1.1 in other investment.

### _1.1.3. FOAK and non-FOAK investments_


A central objective of the Chips Act is to attract European and non-European investments
towards the semiconductor ecosystem in Europe, including public-private investments, support
for manufacturing capacity building for technologies that are not yet present in Europe ( _First-of-_
_a-Kind_ ) [8] . As of October 2025, seven FOAK projects were confirmed and validated both at the EU
and Member States level, representing **a total investment of nearly €31.4 billion, 40% of which**
**are provided via state aid.** A seventh project is currently being negotiated in Czech Republic,
with Onsemi planning to build a €2 billion end-to-end silicon carbide wafer facility. Besides FOAK
projects, Intel and Bosch have both decided to upgrade and extend some of their existing facilities
in Europe, investing respectively €12 billion and €3 billion.


Diamond Foundry Europe have also received the Commission’s greenlight for a non-FOAK €675
million plant in Spain while Global Foundries has announced it will invest €1.1 billion in the
expansion of its production capacities at the Dresden site. On top of these, NXP has obtained a
€1 billion loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance its R&D activities across
Europe, while ASML, together with the regional and governmental authorities of the Netherlands,
will invest nearly €3 billion to strengthen its ecosystem in Eindhoven and its workforce
development programs. The total **FOAK and non-FOAK public-private investments confirmed**
**under the Chips Act account to €53.8 billion** . Four of these investments were made by non-EU
companies, representing **a total foreign direct investment (FDI) of €20.5 billion,** on top of which
a €10 billion joint venture between Taiwan’s TSMC and three European companies (Infineon,
Bosch, NXP) and a €7.5 billion joint venture between STMicroelectronics and Global Foundries
(UAE) were approved.

## **1.2. Looking at the Big Picture**

Two years after its adoption, the Chips Act has already **mobilised €69 billion in investments and**
**public funding across R&D, front-end, and back-end manufacturing projects in Europe.** The
third IPCEI under preparation is expected to further boost this figure. The EU is now approaching
its €86 billion investment target, with contributions split between 48% public funding from
Member States and EU funding, and 52% from private actors.


To complement this quantitative outlook, it is necessary to stress the internal and external
challenges that the Chips Act is facing. The semiconductor industry, including private companies
and public research organisations (RTOs) expresses concern about the **growing disconnect**
**between the first and second pillars of the Chips Act,** particularly the lack of mechanisms to
ensure the effective uptake of technological outputs from the pilot lines. In addition, investment
concentration, the restrictive scope of the FOAK state aid, administrative burden, the limited
policy toolbox available to Member States as well as insufficient end-market demand threaten
the success of the Chips Act’s second Pillar.


The Chips Act has undoubtedly incentivised and attracted strategic investments. The
aforementioned external and internal challenges will however need to be overcome in the
ongoing revision of the Act. For this reason, this Report aims to assess and analyse these
underlying issues in-depth, in order to provide concrete policy recommendations that support
policymakers in the formulation of a future Chips Act 2.0.


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 11 | 5 6


2.
This section provides a comprehensive overview of the Chips Act’s three pillars and their
respective initiatives, highlighting key achievements, persistent challenges and forward-looking
policy recommendations for a Chips Act 2.0.


Starting from **Pillar I of the Chips Act, the section examines the implementation of the pilot**
**lines,** focusing on their administrative processes, industrial integration, and the need for stable,
long-term funding to sustain Europe’s leadership in semiconductor research and development.
It also considers the ongoing development of the **Chips Design Platform**, a cornerstone for
advancing design innovation, fostering collaboration across borders, and strengthening Europe’s
strategic capabilities in chip design architecture.


Following the analysis of Europe’s R&D and design capabilities, the section then turns **to Pillar II**
**and First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) investments,** assessing the current state of industrial projects, the
sectorial concentration of investments, and the gaps that remain in supporting the broader
semiconductor ecosystem. This part delves into the administrative and procedural barriers that
delay project realisation and proposes measures to create a more flexible, coordinated and
robust semiconductor ecosystem in Europe. Alongside, it explores one of the most critical
themes of the semiconductor industry, **workforce development**, by assessing skill shortages,
ongoing educational initiatives, and policy actions needed to secure a sustainable talent pipeline
for Europe’s rapidly evolving semiconductor landscape.


Lastly, the section evaluates **Pillar III**, emphasising the optimisation of **public–private**
**collaboration for supply chain monitoring and crisis response** . It reviews the ongoing work of
the European Semiconductor Board and the Industrial Alliance in developing effective
governance structures, early warning indicators, and mapping tools to better anticipate and
manage potential disruptions.

## **2.1. Pillar I - Pilot Lines**


This part examines the implementation and evolution of **Pillar I of the Chips Act**, focusing on the
pilot lines as a cornerstone of Europe’s semiconductor R&D and industrial strategy. It explores
how these pilot lines have become key instruments for bridging fundamental research and
industrial application, enabling the development of advanced and next-generation
semiconductor technologies. The section highlights their technological scope, early
achievements, and the need to strengthen their operational efficiency, industrial uptake, and
long-term funding within the EU framework.


Beyond their technological dimension, the section addresses **the administrative and structural**
**challenges** that limit the accessibility and efficiency of pilot lines. It assesses procedural
hurdles, funding eligibility gaps, and the barriers faced by smaller firms such as SMEs and


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 12 | 5 6


startups. Building on these findings, it proposes targeted policy measures to simplify procedures,
foster collaboration between Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) and industry, and
accelerate the transition “from lab to fab to market.” Ensuring that pilot lines deliver not only
scientific excellence but also tangible industrial outcomes remains a central objective.


Finally, the section introduces the **European Chips Design Platform**, a strategic initiative aimed
at reinforcing Europe’s semiconductor design capabilities through a cloud-based, collaborative
environment. Closely linked to the pilot lines and manufacturing infrastructures, this platform will
play a critical role in strengthening design-to-fabrication synergies, fostering cross-border
collaboration, and enhancing Europe’s position in global semiconductor innovation.

### _2.1.1. Pilot Lines: A Coherent and Market-Oriented R&D Tool_


Grounded in market realities, the Chips Act aims to equip Europe with the technological and
manufacturing capacity needed to meet the rising demand for advanced and next-generation
semiconductors. The R&D projects launched under Pillar I address growing needs in consumer
electronics – such as personal computers and smartphones – while also supporting emerging
demand from end-user industries (Autonomous driving, renewable energy, 5G / 6G, AI and
quantum) [9] . To meet the technical, power, and energy requirements of these applications, the
pilot lines focus on key enabling technologies like advanced packaging, chiplet architectures,
photonics, and wide-bandgap semiconductors, essential for producing both sub-8nm and
mature-node chips.


**SEMI Europe welcomes the technological focus and the implementation of the pilot lines**
under Pillar I of the Chips Act. Since the adoption of the text, pilot lines have appropriately
targeted semiconductor technologies that are pivotal to match the future market trends of the
semiconductor and relevant end-user industries. To date, nine pilot lines have been approved for
semiconductor technologies, representing a total investment of €4.8 billion. These include five
focused on leading-edge semiconductors and related technologies – from 10nm down to 2nm –
as well as advanced packaging, wide-bandgap semiconductors, and advanced photonics. In
addition, four joint pilot lines are being developed in collaboration with South Korean
researchers. The European Commission will soon announce six new pilot lines dedicated to
quantum technologies, each worth €50 million, bringing total EU funding for pilot line projects to
€5.1 billion.


SEMI Europe has observed that the implementation of the pilot lines has **increased businesses’**
**interest in R&D projects** and, most importantly, **encouraged cross-segment** collaboration
between RTOs and industrial actors – 70% of SEMI Europe respondent members acknowledge
that the Chips Act incentivises collaboration between companies and RTOs. The effectiveness of
the pilot lines is also visible in the global context, where these projects remain unique compared
to the R&D programs implemented across different countries (Ex. U.S., China, Taiwan, South
Korea and Japan).

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 13 | 5 6


Pillar I has effectively built upon one of Europe’s major strengths in the semiconductor sector,
relying on the advanced position of RTOs within global semiconductor R&D. While Europe has a
competitive advantage in R&D, it remains vital to capitalise on its own program’s effectiveness
and successes by strengthening the pilot lines’ architecture. This improvement must focus on the
creation, facilitation and effective deployment of **synergies and collaboration between RTOs**
**and the industry**, guaranteeing the effective industrial uptake of pilot lines’ output, notably via
swifter approval procedures.

### _2.1.2. From Lab-to-Fab-to-Market_


In the September 29 [th] declaration of the Semicon Coalition, signed by all 27 Member States, EU
Council Members have insisted on the indispensable need to foster “complementary European
collaboration between industries, RTOs, public research, SMEs and startups”. To “strengthen
the technology pipeline”, Member States insist on guaranteeing **technology readiness and**
**uptake** from lower R&D levels up to their industrial deployment. Despite the appropriate framing
of the pilot lines and the targeting of prioritised technologies, there are already signals that
structural challenges will hinder Europe’s ability to translate the research results of pilot lines
into commercially viable industrial opportunities.


_**2.1.2.1.**_ _**From Lab-to-Fab-to-Market in Practice**_

Pilot lines encompass all R&D stages, from fundamental technology research (TRL 1) to the
operationalisation of the developed systems (TRL 6). However, their outputs are not immediately
ready for industrial use. So far, Chips Act pilot lines are “ _research_ ” pilot lines that provide funding
exclusively to public organisations, namely RTOs and academia. Under the current Chips Act
framework, participating **companies must cover all associated costs** . To adopt pilot line
results, they must adapt the technology’s design and fabrication processes to their own
equipment, taking on the additional work of advancing from TRL 7 to TRL 9 where products are
refined and qualified for industrial production and commercialisation. This poses significant
challenges, as semiconductor manufacturing equipment and related machine-specific software
vary widely between companies and often differ from those used in the pilot lines.


Outside the pilot lines, the R&D success rate for semiconductor technologies developed by
European RTOs ranges from **40% to 60% when companies are fully involved in the process** .
Typically, RTOs must demonstrate both the quality and industrial potential of their technologies,
often dedicating a full-time expert to help a company adapt the innovation to its production line.
However, under the current framework, limited industry participation in pilot lines is expected to
reduce their success rate and place significant financial burdens on RTOs.


Under the current system, companies bear the full cost of participation in and industrialising pilot
line technologies. These expenses include accessing developed systems, completing product
prototyping and development, integrating technologies into industrial applications, and ensuring
their commercial viability, often requiring substantial material and logistical resources. Moreover,
pilot lines depend on a skilled workforce familiar with specific company operations and facilities,
a capability increasingly scarce in Europe. The significant time and resources required for both
RTOs and industry to adopt new technologies have often **discouraged participation and limited**
**the success of R&D projects** . Within the pilot line framework, this lack of synergy is likely to be
amplified, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 14 | 5 6


The **limited interoperability of raw technologies** emerging from pilot lines further complicates
their industrial adoption and commercialisation, a process that is already resource-intensive,
time-consuming, and uncertain. If these technologies fail to be integrated into industrial
applications, their impact on Europe’s semiconductor sector will remain minimal, if not
negligible. Therefore, the success of pilot lines should not be measured solely by the
development of new technologies, but by the combination of technological achievement and
effective industrial uptake.


_**2.1.2.2.**_ _**SMEs, Startups and Scaleups**_

For SMEs, startups, and scale-ups, the costs associated with accessing pilot line outputs are
prohibitively high, effectively excluding them from benefiting from Pillar I advancements. The
Chips Fund was designed to close this gap by improving access to capital through Horizon
Europe’s Innovation Council Accelerator and the InvestEU Fund. Yet in practice, **accessibility**
**remains limited** . These smaller firms, despite their strong innovation potential, often lack
dedicated funding or project management departments. As a result, many must outsource
application and reporting processes to expensive consultancies, creating additional financial
barriers that discourage participation. Instead of lowering barriers to innovation, pilot lines have
inadvertently reinforced them, sidelining the very actors the Chips Act was meant to empower.


Strengthening collaboration between RTOs and smaller semiconductor companies is therefore
essential. These firms often occupy specialised niches within the semiconductor value chain,
supplying materials, components, and subsystems to larger manufacturers. Since major
companies depend on extensive networks of sub-suppliers – sometimes numbering in the
hundreds – limited SME access to pilot line outputs risks creating technological gaps across the
ecosystem. This disconnect could slow the adoption of new technologies, as suppliers struggle
to align their capabilities with the advanced outputs of pilot lines. Reducing access costs and
**ensuring fair participation for SMEs, startups** **and scale-ups** is thus crucial to building a
cohesive, multi-layered semiconductor innovation ecosystem in Europe.


_**2.1.2.3.**_ _**Increasing R&D Synergies in the Pilot Lines**_

The Chips Act has successfully encouraged RTOs and industry to strengthen their collaborations.
However, its current structure and European competition rules limit industrial participation in
pilot lines, forcing companies to either cover all adoption costs themselves or rely on national
support through Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs). As a result, while
pilot lines are underway, the industrial uptake of these technologies – whether via IPCEIs or
company resources – will take several years to yield tangible results. For SMEs, startups, and
scale-ups, who currently lack access to pilot line outputs, additional time is required to develop
compatible technologies or adapt existing solutions to meet these new systems and demands.


To achieve a fast, efficient, and cost-effective uptake of pilot line outputs, it is essential to
recognise that **R&D is a multi-actor process involving RTOs, academia, and all industrial**
**stakeholders**, spanning the full spectrum from basic research (TRL 1) to industrial adaptation
and commercialisation (TRL 9). Active participation from both industry and academia is therefore
critical to the success of pilot lines. Pillar I of the Chips Act faces two key challenges: first,
ensuring that current pilot lines are successfully industrialised and commercialised; and second,
building Europe’s long-term advanced capacities by sustaining continuous investment in R&D to
support the emergence of next-generation semiconductor technologies.


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 15 | 5 6


_**2.1.2.4.**_ _**Industrialising Existing Pilot Lines and Creating Industrial Cycles**_

To support the uptake of Pillar I pilot lines, it is essential to bridge the industrialisation gap
between pilot line outputs and their future users by implementing measures that maximise R&D
success. One approach is the **creation of “** _**industrial**_ **” pilot lines** that build on the results of
existing “ _research_ ” pilot lines from the first Chips Act, with a focus on industrialisation [10] . These
“industrial” pilot lines would pool prototyping projects from companies of all sizes (large firms,
SMEs, and startups) under a single framework to develop a single technology. This approach can
reduce access costs, streamline the use of pilot line results, and accelerate industrialisation and
commercialisation.


This strategy should be complemented by **preferential access to Pillar II state aid** for all
semiconductor ecosystem investment projects linked to pilot lines, covering design, materials,
components, equipment, chip manufacturing, and ATP operations. Together, these measures
would create a more inclusive and efficient pathway from R&D to market-ready technologies,
ensuring the full potential of Europe’s pilot lines are realised.





_**2.1.2.5.**_ _**Chips Act 2.0: Pilot Lines’ Funding in the Long-Term EU Budget**_

While Pillar II state aid exemptions provide ongoing and stable support for the industry, Pillar I
currently appears more limited in scope and duration. Although the Chips Act provisions may
assume that the European Commission will continue to develop and launch future pilot lines,
significant uncertainty remains. Existing pilot lines focus on advanced technologies already being
pursued globally, underscoring the need for sustained long-term investment in European R&D to
maintain a leading position and keep pace with the sector’s rapid evolution. Emerging
technologies, including AI, quantum computing, and increasingly complex consumer devices,
electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems, will drive new semiconductor demand,
requiring capabilities that are not yet fully realised.


10 So far, Chips Act pilot lines are “ _research_ ” pilot lines that provide funding exclusively to public organisations,
namely RTOs and academia.


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 16 | 5 6


To anticipate future demand and reinforce Europe’s research leadership, the Chips Act 2.0 should
establish a **cyclic renewed budget** line within the EU budget. Compared to global competitors
channelling tens or even hundreds of billions of euros into domestic semiconductor investment,
the current European framework lacks sufficient financial capacity. Securing a continuously
renewed budget for pilot lines (Pillar I), alongside a stable state support framework (Pillar II),
would provide the **policy predictability and stability** that the semiconductor industry needs.
This approach would not create new funding mechanisms but would leverage existing programs
for semiconductors. Allocating a portion of the pilot lines’ budget specifically to industrial and
academic actors, including dedicated support for SMEs, startups, and scale-ups, would further
strengthen cross-segment collaboration, accelerating the industrialisation and
commercialisation of pilot line outputs.

### _2.1.3. Working Towards Swift Pilot Lines’ Processes_


Pilot lines are financially supported by the Chips for Europe Initiative, combining funding from
Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programme, aiming to “achieve large-scale technological
capacity building [...], advanced design, system integration and chip production capabilities in
the Union” [11] . Although non-public actors have the possibility to be involved in the pilot lines,
assuming that they bear the associated costs, pilot lines remain rather unattractive for a
dominant share of the industry.


One barrier to pilot lines’ attractiveness is the **administrative burden** associated with accessing
the pilot lines. Application dossiers are lengthy, complex, and disproportionate to the level of
funding requested. Applicants must navigate repetitive documentation and fulfil multiple
procedural requirements, diverting significant human resources away from innovation
processes. Once projects are approved, the reporting obligations represent another heavy
hurdle. Financial reports, technical updates and compliance checks are often overly frequent
and time-consuming, creating inefficiencies for the actors involved and forcing them to prioritise
paperwork over genuine R&D activities.


In addition, the procedures themselves are **fragmented and rigid** . Single pilot line projects have
led to the multiplication of contracts and tendering processes, delaying implementation. In
practice, even the procurement of basic goods such as office supplies is subject to extensive


[11Chips Act (2023/1781), article 4.1. URL](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1781/oj/eng)


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 17 | 5 6


tendering, with no flexibility for early communication or coordination with suppliers. To go
through the corresponding administrative processes, companies must commission additional
full-time employees to the task. The direct **effect on smaller companies’ resources (SMEs,**
**start-ups and scale-ups) is disproportionally higher** while they remain essential for disruptive
R&D. This procedural rigidity slows down project launches and adds layers of bureaucracy with
little added value. It is worth stressing that an administrative simplification of the pilot lines must
preserve the current framework for the Hosting Agreement and Joint Procurement Agreement,
which were jointly developed by the European Commission and the RTOs to fit the specificities
of the industry.


Finally, the **eligibility framework for funding** is not fully aligned with operational needs. While
investments in equipment, tools and components are supported, other equally essential
elements required for cleanroom operations (Ex. Energy, materials sourcing and storage) remain
excluded from eligibility. This creates **funding gaps** that make participation impractical for many
actors and could potentially undermine the long-term economic viability and industrial uptake of
pilot lines’ outputs. With regards to these challenges, SEMI Europe and its members have
identified key targeted policy recommendations to fully mobilise Europe’s semiconductor
ecosystem and make pilot lines a greater success.




### _2.1.4. Chips Design Platform_

The **Design Platform** established under the _European Chips Act_ is a cornerstone initiative under
Pillar I (“Chips for Europe”) aimed at strengthening Europe’s semiconductor design capabilities,
by providing a virtual, cloud-based environment that integrates electronic design automation
(EDA) tools, intellectual property (IP) libraries, and design facilities accessible to users across the
EU.


A consortium of twelve European research and technology organisations (RTOs), coordinated by
IMEC, CEA-Leti, Fraunhofer and Fondazione Chips, has been selected to build and operate the


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 18 | 5 6


platform under the Chips Joint Undertaking (Chips JU). The grant agreement is expected to run
from 2025 to 2028. The technical development phase now focuses on constructing the cloud
environment, populating it with EDA tools and IP libraries, and creating seamless design-tofabrication routes through integration with pilot lines and packaging/test infrastructures.


In the coming months, the **main priorities include finalising funding arrangements,**
**implementing the digital infrastructure, and defining access and cost models** for participants
across Member States. The success of the Design Platform will ultimately depend on the effective
collaboration between academia, industry, and national competence centres, ensuring that
design activity is well connected to Europe’s emerging pilot manufacturing lines and foundries.

## **2.2. Pillar II – First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) Facilities**


The European Chips Act has incentivised EU Member States to provide direct financial support to
companies for the construction of new semiconductor manufacturing facilities or the upgrade of
existing ones. This measure has been central to the Act’s success, improving the attractiveness
of Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and encouraging strategic investments from both EU and
non-EU actors. This section examines the implementation of Pillar II, including the **First-of-a-**
**Kind (FOAK) framework**, and provides an in-depth analysis of the state of play, sectoral and
geographical coverage, and the broader implications for Europe’s semiconductor supply chain.


While Pillar II has been instrumental in supporting manufacturing activities, **a majority of SEMI**
**Europe respondent members (60%) have expressed concerns** regarding the scope of strategic
investments and the associated administrative burden. The sub-section explores these
challenges in detail, including the exclusion of critical segments such as private R&D centres,
chip design and design tools, semiconductor equipment, materials, and component suppliers. It
highlights the need to extend support to these essential actors to strengthen Europe’s
semiconductor ecosystem, foster innovation, and ensure technological sovereignty.


Finally, this sub-section addresses **administrative and procedural challenges** that affect
investment attractiveness and industrial uptake. Overlapping processes at both EU and national
levels, lengthy validation timelines, and complex reporting obligations create resource-intensive
hurdles for companies. The sub-section provides targeted recommendations to simplify FOAK,
IPF, and OEF procedures, enhance coordination between Member States and EU authorities, and
improve the overall flexibility of the policy framework. Together, these analyses form a
comprehensive overview of Pillar II’s strengths, limitations, and potential improvements, setting
the stage for a more inclusive and competitive European semiconductor ecosystem.

### _2.2.1. First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) Investments’ State of Play_


Since the adoption of the Chips Act, six FOAK investment projects have been approved, totalling
nearly **€24 billion** (as of October 2025). Five of these projects, amounting to €20.7 billion, focus
on front-end manufacturing and target key end-user sectors such as automotive, medical
devices, renewable energy, and consumer products. One project, valued at €3.2 billion, is
dedicated to expanding back-end capacities in Europe, providing advanced packaging and
testing solutions that integrate panel chiplets. Additionally, two other projects are being
developed. Discussion between Onsemi and the Czech government to establish a €2 billion front

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 19 | 5 6


end SiC wafer facility and a Global Foundry FD-SOI Wafer project in Dresden, Germany, are
ongoing (see Annex I for a detailed overview).


The FOAK instrument should move beyond a short-term impulse to becoming a long-term
strategic industrial policy instrument. Overall, the FOAK projects show a clear **sectoral**
**concentration**, primarily focused on chips and specialised wafer fabrication, and geographically
limited to a few countries, including Germany, Italy, and Austria. Notably, these investments
largely **exclude R&D, design, semiconductor-related equipment, and materials and**
**components production** . Combined with lengthy EU-level administrative procedures, these
factors have delayed project launches compared to global competitors, limiting Europe’s ability
to attract and secure strategic investments in the semiconductor sector.

### _2.2.2. Shortcomings of the First-of-a-Kind Criteria_


The sizeable investments that have been incentivised under Pillar II of the Chips Act have focused
on increasing Europe’s front-end semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in the most
advanced segments. That said, numerous companies active in **other critical segments** of the
semiconductor supply chain could have brought highly beneficial investments to the European
Union and the growth of its semiconductor industrial capacities. However, their technologies did
not qualify as FOAK projects and were therefore ineligible to receive state aid from their national
governments. The current framework of the **Chips Act excludes companies that are critical for**
**the European semiconductor ecosystem**, namely including private R&D centres, chip design
and design tool, equipment, materials and components’ suppliers, despite their strategic
importance to achieve the overarching Chips Act objective to “strengthen the semiconductor
ecosystem at Union level” [12] .


This strategic gap in the definition and application of the FOAK criteria has prevented Europe’s
broad semiconductor ecosystem of private R&D centres, chip design and design tool companies,
as well as semiconductor equipment, materials, and component suppliers, from benefiting from
FOAK state aid and Pillar II support.


_**2.2.2.1.**_ _**Semiconductor Supply Chain: A Missing Piece in FOAK**_

In pursuit of the EU’s Digital Decade target to reach 20% share of global chip production by 2030,
the Chips Act has so far prioritised strategic investments towards front-end manufacturing
facilities. Among the 13 confirmed, paused and cancelled FOAK investments, ten projects are
**focusing on front-end semiconductor manufacturing**, and three projects **focus on back-end**
**manufacturing** (see Annex I).


The Chips Act’ focus on increasing semiconductor manufacturing capacity in Europe rationally
reflects the European Commission’s and the Member States’ policy priorities when the legislation
was formulated. Following the global chip shortage that was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,
there was an unprecedented political momentum to support the EU’s key manufacturing
industries (Automotive, medical technologies, telecommunications, machinery and robotics),
aiming to reduce strategic dependencies on foreign chips.


12 Chips Act (2023/1781), article 1.1. [URL](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1781/oj/eng)


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 20 | 5 6


At this point in time, however, Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem is strongly advocating for an
**expansion of the Pillar II framework**, to ensure that the foreseen support measures can target
the other critical segments of the supply chain, including private R&D centres, design and design
tools as well as semiconductor equipment (Photolithography, metrology, inspection and testing),
materials (Specialty gases, photoresists, polysilicon) and components suppliers (Photomasks,
ultra-precise optics and photonics, raw wafers).


2.2.2.1.1. Private Research and Development Centres


Pillar I of the Chips Act created a framework for emerging semiconductor technologies in Europe,
setting up dedicated funding schemes and pilot lines for the semiconductor industry. The
considerable investments made by the EU have directly benefited public research organisations,
namely RTOs and academia. **Private R&D centres and labs are not entitled to receive public**
**support** from the EU, neither under Pillar I, nor under Pillar II from their respective national
governments.


Semiconductor companies across the supply chain are highly R&D intensive, with an average
R&D spending of 15%-20% of their total revenues. Multiple companies, including Intel and Bosch,
are carrying out significant investments towards the expansion and upgrade of their existing R&D
labs across Europe, to develop new technologies (Ex. 7nm chips). Nonetheless, the current Chips
Act framework does not allow these crucial projects to receive public support at the EU or
national level.


Private R&D activities are essential for companies to adapt to the rapidly changing technological
evolutions and complex innovation cycles, particularly in the semiconductor industry, where
there is a constant drive towards smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient chips. Besides the
clear benefits towards our industry, these activities generate powerful spillover benefits across
multiple end-user industries. As a matter of fact, advances in chip performance can facilitate the
development of AI systems, safer and autonomous vehicles, smarter and connected factories,
thereby fuelling innovation across the entire economy and enabling the green and digital
transition.


2.2.2.1.2. Chip Design and Design Tools


Under the current Pillar II framework, facilities involved in the “design and production of
equipment or key components for equipment” are eligible for support under the FOAK criteria.
However, since the Chips Act’s inception, **no investments in these segments** have materialised.
Chip capabilities are primarily determined during the design phase, which involves critical
architectural decisions to anticipate operational, sustainability, and energy efficiency
requirements throughout a product’s lifetime, as well as compliance with market regulations and
supply chain resilience. This phase generates substantial intellectual property and advances
Europe’s capacities in strategic sectors, including AI, IoT, quantum computing, advanced
automotive systems, and industrial automation.


The **lack of targeted support for the design segment** remains a significant challenge,
particularly given Europe’s relatively limited design capabilities compared to global leaders.
Nonetheless, Europe maintains a strong industrial base that could bolster sovereign design
capabilities. World-class RTOs such as **IMEC**, **CEA-Leti**, and **Fraunhofer** provide advanced
design infrastructure and expertise. On the industrial side, **ARM** leads in processor architecture


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 21 | 5 6


and IP licensing, while **Siemens** **EDA** delivers software for designing complex integrated circuits
and systems-on-chip (SoCs), supporting applications from automotive electronics and industrial
automation to AI and data centres. Coordinated investments and shared infrastructure
connecting design companies, research institutes, and semiconductor manufacturers could
fully leverage these capabilities.


In this context, the Chips Act offers specific policy support (Art. 17) for the design segment by
encouraging Member States to support facilities awarded the “Design Centre of Excellence” label
by the European Commission. Yet, no facilities have received the label, and the Delegated Act
outlining the application procedure and criteria has not been published. This legal uncertainty
discourages companies from applying and Member States from granting state aid, effectively
stalling investments in the critical design segment of the semiconductor supply chain.


2.2.2.1.3. Semiconductor Equipment


Although semiconductor equipment is falling under the framework of the Chips Act, there has
been a **considerable lack of investment and public support** for this segment. This is linked to
the fact that the very definition strictly covers equipment that is “utilised in semiconductor
manufacturing,” thereby reducing the scope of technologies that could be supported under Pillar
II. One could argue that semiconductor equipment is implicitly covered under the FOAK
definition; however, **this lack of clarity undermines the legal certainty companies require** to
plan multi-billion-euro investment projects, which risk being halted at the administrative level
due to regulatory ambiguity.


The European semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem retains excellence at the
global level, demonstrated by a number of highly active EU and non-EU companies. **ASML**
(Netherlands) dominates lithography equipment, crucially including extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
systems, while **ASM International** (Netherlands) and **Aixtron** (Germany) provide deposition
technologies (ALD and CVD). **Trumpf** (Germany), a world leader in machine tool production,
delivers high-power lasers for micromachining and various lithography applications.
Complementing these European players, non-EU companies including Applied Materials, **LAM**
**Research** and **Tokyo Electron** operate production, service, and R&D facilities in Europe.


Europe’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem, anchored by the aforementioned
industry leaders, is strategically vital, as its advanced lithography, deposition, and precision tools
are indispensable for chip production worldwide. Strengthening the **equipment ecosystem will**
**enhance Europe’s position in the semiconductor value chain**, sustain long-term technological
sovereignty and competitiveness, and ultimately make it less vulnerable to global supply
disruptions. Beyond core semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the semiconductor industry
vitally depends on metrology and inspection systems, test and packaging equipment (Ex. Wafer
probers and die bonders), and process control tools (Ex. Vacuum pumps and gas delivery
systems). These equipment types are strategic enablers of semiconductor manufacturing, since
they underpin yield optimisation, reliability assurance and process stability, where Europe
remains highly dependent on non-EU suppliers particularly from the US and Japan.


2.2.2.1.4. Materials


Besides semiconductor equipment, a wide range of materials, such as specialty gases,
photoresists and polysilicon, used across the front-end and back-end of the supply chain are


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 22 | 5 6


entirely excluded from the FOAK criteria and the scope of Pillar II. These materials are
fundamental building blocks of semiconductor manufacturing:


  - **Photoresists** are light-sensitive materials that define circuit patterns during lithography,
directly impacting feature resolution and yield, including chemically amplified resists for
EUV or DUV processes and thick-film resists for MEMS applications.


  - **Specialty gases** (Ex. Silane, ammonia, nitrogen trifluoride) are essential for deposition,
etching, and doping processes, enabling precise control over layer composition and
electrical properties.


  - **Polysilicon** serves as a key conductor in transistors and gate structures, providing the
high-purity foundation required for wafer manufacturing.


Europe hosts several key producers and suppliers of these critical materials, including both EU
and non-EU companies, which are indispensable for building the continent’s chip and wafer
production capacities. In specialty gases, leading firms such as **Air Liquide** (France), **Messer**
**Group**, and **Linde** (Germany) supply ultra-high-purity gases vital for deposition and etching
processes. For photoresists and lithography chemicals, **Merck KGaA** (Germany) and **Syensqo**
(Belgium) provide advanced resists, developers, and specialty electronic materials for nextgeneration lithography, complemented by non-EU companies like **JSR** and **Fujifilm Electronic**
**Materials**, which maintain production and R&D facilities in Europe. In polysilicon production,
**Wacker Chemie** (Germany) remains the world’s dominant manufacturer of semiconductorgrade polysilicon, representing a strategic asset for the European ecosystem.


Supporting Europe’s capabilities to produce these critical materials is essential to ensure
competitiveness and supply chain resilience. These materials are indispensable for high-yield,
high-performance chip and wafer production, and any disruption in their supply could halt
fabrication entirely, regardless of advances in equipment or design capabilities.


2.2.2.1.5. Components


Complementing Europe’s critical capabilities in equipment and materials, a range of EU and nonEU companies produce the **key components that enable semiconductor manufacturing**
**equipment to operate** efficiently. These suppliers provide specialised tools, optical
components, photomasks, and precision machinery that are essential for chip production across
various technology nodes. Their contributions underpin the long-term strength, resilience, and
technological independence of Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem. Despite their strategic
importance, these companies are currently excluded from the FOAK criteria and the scope of
Pillar II, meaning they cannot receive direct public support under the current Chips Act
framework.


Notable examples include **Carl Zeiss SMT (Germany)**, a leading provider of high-precision and
unique lenses and optical systems critical for ASML’s lithography machines and the global
industry. **SÜSS MicroTec (Germany)** supplies photomask aligners and related equipment for
both R&D and high-volume production, while **Tekscend Photomask** operates significant
facilities in Europe, including Dresden and Corbeil-Essonnes, supporting advanced photomask
production.


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 23 | 5 6


Looking ahead, a future Chips Act framework should prioritise nurturing this network of
equipment component providers, including smaller companies, to strengthen Europe’s
semiconductor ecosystem. Supporting these actors will be crucial to maintain technological
sovereignty, foster innovation, and ensure supply chain resilience in critical segments, reducing
reliance on non-EU suppliers and safeguarding the continent’s ability to produce next-generation
chips.

### _2.2.3. Chips Act 2.0: Building a European Ecosystem_


Pillar II of the Chips Act exclusively authorises state aid provision for FOAK facilities, meaning
“new or substantially upgraded semiconductor manufacturing facilities providing a dimension of
innovation not yet present in the EU” [13] . This approach was coherently and appropriately designed
to support the emergence of cutting-edge semiconductor technologies and to contribute
towards building new manufacturing capabilities in Europe. There is, however, a need for an
**expanded strategic outlook** that focuses not only on attracting new technologies, particularly in
the leading-edge chips, but also supports the growth of strategically relevant segments of the
value chain in Europe.


The focus of Pillar II was not designed to support existing European industrial capacities, and did
not aim to secure segments of the supply chain where Europe already has capacity. Although
supporting leading-edge technologies is important to compete globally, a **lack of emphasis**
**towards the consolidation of existing capacities** may endanger Europe’s position in the
medium- and long-term. Supporting European industry indeed requires securing and
strengthening existing capacities for legacy chips, as well as for R&D activities, design,
equipment and materials production, which can strengthen the overall semiconductor
ecosystem.


Pillar II of the European Chips Act provides incentives to investments in two ways. First, it provides
the criteria to recognise a facility project as eligible to receiving state aid. While the state aid
provided to semiconductor companies relies on Article 107(3) of the of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU'), the validation of this aid by the Commission strongly
considers the “First-Of-A-Kind” dimension of the project [14] . Second, it “entitles undertakings to a
streamlined approach to administrative applications and a priority access to the pilot lines” [15] to
facilities recognised as “Integrated Production Facility” (IPF) or “Open EU Foundry” (OEF). To
guarantee the legal coherence of the FOAK with the IPF and OEF, and with Chapter III of the Chips
Act in general, their definitions and scope are fully aligned in the Act. Hence, any amendment to
one of these definitions must be reflected in the other definitions.


One way to best guarantee this coherence of the text is to directly insert the missing segments of
the supply chain (i.e. private R&D, design, materials, component and equipment suppliers) in the
definitions of the IPF (Article 13) and OEF (Article 14). However, these two types of facilities were
established to reflect the two common business models of semiconductor manufacturing

facilities (i.e. Integrated Device Manufacturers and Foundries) and are quite specific in scope [16] .
This might require a more flexible approach via the creation of **new categories evolving next to**
**the IPF and OEF** under Chapter III of the Act. These categories could be delimited as follow:


**Research and Development Centre of Excellence:** Private R&D centres contributing to

the upgrade of existing semiconductor-related facilities’ production and the development
of new production solutions and systems, and the emergence of new and future cuttingedge technologies.
**Design Centre of Excellence** : Revision of Article 17 establishing a “Design Centre of

Excellence” label based on the same criteria of IPF and OEF to simplify the framework.
**Critical Supply Chain Facility** : Suppliers of critical materials (Ex. Gases, chemicals, raw

and critical materials, raw wafers), components (Ex. Photomasks, high-precision lenses
and optical systems) and semiconductor-related equipment (Ex. Metrology and
inspection systems, test and packaging and process control).




### _2.2.4. Centralising and Fast-Tracking Pillar II Processes_

The processes required for the verification and attribution of the First-of-a-Kind (FOAK),
Integrated Production Facility (IPF) and Open EU Foundry (OEF) certification have often put
significant time and resource constraints on companies. This challenge has highlighted a tension
between guaranteeing swift procedures for companies, while safeguarding the Single Market and
the EU competition framework. To receive authorisation from the European Commission on the
provision of state aid, the concerned facility project must be acknowledged as a First-Of-A-Kind
(FOAL) facility. Hence, the FOAK label is a prerequisite for companies to receive state aid from EU
Member States, granted by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition (DG
COMP). The IPF and OEF labels are granted by the Directorate-General for Communications
Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) based, notably but not exclusively, on the
FOAK nature of the project. While those labels give access to different set of benefits, they

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 25 | 5 6


overlap significantly in their attribution processes and criteria. In addition to these procedures at
the EU level, companies are subject to overlapping resource-intensive and time-intensive
national processes for projects’ authorisation.


_**2.2.4.1.**_ _**Multi-Level Administrative Challenges for FOAK Investments**_

The processes to submit dossiers to DG CONNECT and DG COMP for the respective IPF/OEF and
FOAK labels remain decoupled, even though their requirements are strongly similar.
Administratively, this forces companies to prepare and submit two **separate, but largely**
**overlapping, proposals** to the two Directorates. On average, the application, processing, and
validation of these dossiers at the **EU level takes 9–12 months** . Once the FOAK label is granted,
additional months are required to finalise agreements between companies investing in Europe
and the Member State providing state aid. By comparison, grant validation and related
administrative processes for semiconductor investments take just **5–6 months in the U.S., 6**
**months in China, and less than a month in South Korea and Taiwan** .


European and non-European companies looking to invest in Europe must navigate a layered set
of administrative requirements at national and EU levels. Delays in obtaining FOAK validation and
state aid approvals add to often lengthy national negotiations, permitting processes, and other
administrative steps, all of which are **complex, repetitive, and resource-intensive** . In addition,
national co-funding is often being delayed or withdrawn due to national budget constraints,
bringing further constraint at both the EU and national levels. **Coherent implementation** at both
EU and national levels to minimise the risk of cancellations by Member States, delays, or
inconsistencies in national funding programs must be achieved to reduce uncertainties for FOAK
beneficiaries.


Many companies applying for FOAK state aid simultaneously pursue investment plans in other
regions of the world, which can come into direct competition with the European projects. In these
cases, countries that can grant permits and finalise approval processes more quickly are
prioritised, often at the expense of European investments. These **cumulative delays** directly
affect the operationalisation of facilities and the commercialisation of new technologies,
potentially leading to lower or unplanned losses of market share.


_**2.2.4.2.**_ _**Guaranteeing Competition Rules and Facilitating Semiconductor**_
_**Investments**_

One important factor contributing to this delay lies in the time and resources that companies
must allocate to respond to the inquiries of the European Commission, with regards to their
application dossier and technical specificities of the projects.


The number of questions from the Commission has ranged from 50 up to 100. The nature and
scope of these questions have often influenced the validation timeline of FOAK projects. While
questions have reportedly been repetitive and sometimes not specific, and not applicable, to the
semiconductor industry, others have touched upon highly sensitive competitive information
where possible leak of information was a very high concern for foreign and EU companies.


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 26 | 5 6


SEMI Europe fully acknowledges that this process is an unavoidable condition to safeguard the
EU’s competition rules, its internal market and the level playing field for all companies operating
in Europe. A **right balance** can be found to maintain the European acquis and simplify the
abovementioned procedures, by streamlining FOAK and IPF/OEF processes and making them
more industry-specific. This harmonisation and simplification must be achieved in collaboration
with the semiconductor ecosystem, both at the horizontal level within the European Commission
and the vertical level with EU Member States, to streamline dialogue and overlapping processes
between national governments and EU authorities.




## **2.3. Workforce Development**

### _2.3.1. Addressing the issue_

The European semiconductor industry is facing a significant labour shortage. While the current
workforce is approximately 382,000 employees (of which 49% are employed in integrated device
manufacturers, IDMs), it is expected to grow by 156,000 new positions, reaching nearly 540,000
workers by 2030. Taking into account factors such as investment scale and retirement rates,
overall employment growth in the sector is projected at around 4.5% by 2030. However, the rapid
increase in job openings is outpacing the supply of graduates, further exacerbating the gap over
time. According to the ECSA Skills Strategy 2025 [17], the European Union is expected to face a
shortage of more than 65,000 skilled professionals by that time.


The **industry’s core workforce is highly technical**, with hardware engineers, technicians,
software engineers, and data specialists comprising roughly 75% of all roles and, indeed, the


[17 Skills Strategy 2025, European Chips Skills Academy. URL: https://chipsacademy.eu/wp-](https://chipsacademy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-ECSA-Skills-Strategy-final.pdf)
[content/uploads/2025/11/2025-ECSA-Skills-Strategy-fnal.pdf](https://chipsacademy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-ECSA-Skills-Strategy-final.pdf)


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 27 | 5 6


majority of the projected talent gap. Over the past five years, shortages have become particularly
critical in three profiles: data specialists, system designers, and analog designers. The rapid
development of artificial intelligence is also expected to drive high demand for machine learning
engineers and related skills profiles. By 2030, the most critical talent gaps are projected to
include hardware engineers (40,000 positions), technicians (23,500 positions), and software
engineers / data specialists (11,000 positions).


On the academic side, the EU ranks third globally [18] in terms of Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Mathematics (STEM) graduates, producing 1.2 million STEM graduates in 2022. However, only
28% of STEM students graduate in the semiconductor-related domains (electrical engineering,
physics, and so on); and less than 18,000 of those graduates entered the EU semiconductor
industry. Already today, employers report difficulty in finding skilled talent, which is exacerbated
by the stagnating rate of new graduates as well as the ambition and investment stemming from
the EU Chips Act. There is a clear need to comprehensively fix the ‘leaky pipeline’ by increasing
the **attractiveness and awareness of career opportunities** for young students, strengthening
collaboration between industry and education, and improving lifelong learning opportunities to
ensure professionals can grow in their roles as technology evolves.


The extent of the skills shortage varies across Member States and is closely linked to the
semiconductor investment patterns across the EU. Countries with advanced semiconductor
infrastructure, such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, are experiencing growing demand for
skilled workers. On the other hand, countries such as Spain, Romania, Greece, Croatia and
Bulgaria report a surplus of electrical engineering graduates relative to the size of their national
semiconductor ecosystems. Strengthening **cross-border collaboration** between Member
States is essential to ensure employers can tap into a pool of skill talent regardless of location
and mitigate the risks associated with failed or withdrawn investments from the European
market.


_**2.3.1.1.**_ _**Structural Challenges**_

Several structural challenges underpin the current skills and workforce challenges. These include
a lack of specialised higher education and vocational training, limited training opportunities and
support for teachers, and failure to structurally anticipate and proactively address increasingly
critical job profiles. Many small-scale initiatives at local, national, and even European level try to
address these shortcomings, but without a **defined coordinating body** it is impossible for these
activities to make a large impact and easy to duplicate efforts or miss opportunities to unite and
scale.


The European Chips Act elevates the issue by explicitly defining as one of its priorities the need
to “address the skills shortage, attract new talent and support the emergence of a skilled
workforce.” [19] . To this end, the Act has established a framework of projects and partnerships
dedicated to addressing the talent gap and strengthening the skills pipeline across the
semiconductor ecosystem. These initiatives are primarily financed through the Chips Joint
Undertaking, with additional support provided by Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe


18 Behind China and India, but above the US.

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 28 | 5 6


Programme. However, these initiatives have largely operated in silo, all but missing out on
synergies with projects funded through other instruments such as Erasmus+ with identical or
complementary goals.


The European Semiconductor Board (ESB was) introduced to govern the Chips Act, comprising
representatives of the Member States and chaired by the Commission, and providing advice,
assistance and recommendations across the three action pillars. The ESB is connected to only
one DG (CNECT), and it derives its authority from the important Chips Act and the CHIPS JU. So
far, the ESB is composed of representatives of the EC and the public authorities – i.e. without
representatives from the education field, nor from industry – and any steering on skills and
workforce is currently missing. Building on this, the Industrial Alliance on Processors and
Semiconductor Technologies was established supported by the ALLPROS project to
operationalise work across three topics: PFAS, Supply Chain, and Skills. These working groups
ostensibly report directly to the ESB, however, particularly in the case of the Skills working group,
the lack of representatives from industry and education have made it difficult for the ESB to
function as a supervisory body on this topic.


_**2.3.1.2.**_ _**Implementation State of Play**_


2.3.1.2.1. Early Education, University, and Technical Training


While the imminent talent shortages demand urgency, a **long-term vision** is required to ensure
sustained access to skilled professionals as the industry grows. This means also taking steps to
better incorporate technology and engineering skills already in primary and secondary school
curriculum. Effective strategies to implement STEM education in schools involve: (i) stimulating
an interdisciplinary approach which involve breaking down the silos between the various STEM
components, and mimicking real-world scenarios; (ii) providing teachers with continuous
training in STEM for schools, offer them content knowledge, and train them to implement
technology in their subjects; (iii) setting up dedicated spaces or labs to encourage designing,
developing prototypes, and creating innovative products (possible in partnership with local
companies); (iv) setting up STEM clubs aimed at supporting students groups to foster passion and
explore beyond the classroom.


One of the few initiatives addressing this gap and which could be replicated is the **STEM Teacher**
**Internship Program in Ireland**, developed in collaboration with Intel and other partners, which
offers paid placements for primary and secondary school teachers in technology and
microelectronics companies [20] . These internships provide teachers with hands-on experience in
real STEM environments and equip them with necessary skills and industry knowledge to inspire
students and bring gained insights into classrooms. To date, more than 300 teachers have
completed internships across 70 companies, with an estimated impact on over one million
students [21] . Scaling similar initiatives at the European level could strengthen early STEM
engagement and support a strong foundation for later high-tech careers.


In this respect, the EU STEM Coalition should also be noted as an important partner. This is the
EU's main network of 35 national/regional STEM platforms, European members, and national
(associate) members. The Coalition started its activities in 2015 and covers a large range of

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 29 | 5 6


activities, which also include chip technology. In principle the “golden triangle” of stakeholders
consisting of Schools + Industry + Ministries of Education are necessary to be successful in
promoting STEM education


In order to motivate students with the right qualifications to actually embark on STEM studies, the
image of the semiconductor industry as an attractive job environment needs to be boosted
through communication campaigns (i) addressing the general public and the students; and (ii)
driven/supported by the companies and research institutes.


**Apprenticeships are a cornerstone of vocational education** **and training** (VET) systems across
Europe. They combine company-based training with school-based education, and lead to a
nationally recognised qualification when completed. Member states across Europe, notably
Germany, have long recognised the value of apprenticeships, as the work-study combination is
an excellent preparation for the subsequent work environment. However, the apprenticeship
programme strategy in Europe faces several challenges, including (i) scalability issues for SMEs
that lack resources to develop comprehensive programmes, and (ii) the need for continuous
curriculum updates to keep pace with evolving industry standards, particularly in high-tech
sectors.


2.3.1.2.2. Lifelong Learning


Companies will have to cut through the complexities of up- and reskilling workers. Available
programs often focus on back-office workers, neglecting the critical need for skilled fab workers
where the shortage is more severe. Recent research has pointed out that while 74% of
manufacturers are looking at upskilling existing workers as a strategy to address labour
shortages, 67% of manufacturing workers are not satisfied with the existing training programs [22] .

Educators agree that the most effective learning strategy is person **alised and contextualised to**
**the needs of the learner and the environment** where the learning will be applied. In 2022 the
Council of the EU adopted a recommendation on micro-credentials advocating their
development, implementation and recognition across institutions, businesses, sectors and
borders. Industry recognised micro-credentials offer a model by which companies and training
providers can offer targeted re-skilling and upskilling programs to address emerging skills
demands.

2.3.1.2.3. Regional Ecosystem Programs


As workforce needs are concentrated in regional “talent ecosystems”, the local regions have a
pressing need - hence a crucial commensurate role - to develop the talent and workforce. The
Brainport Eindhoven region is an excellent example in this respect: the region has been coming
up against limits in terms of personnel, space and energy. The Dutch central and regional
governments have made agreements aimed at addressing the problems in the Dutch
semiconductor sector. Through the **“Project Beethoven”**, the authorities have worked out a
substantial package amounting to €2.5 billion involving measures for education and
infrastructure for the sector. [i] The package includes investment in vocational and professional
talent, and in sufficient space, good accessibility and affordable housing in the Brainport area.
As part of this package, the government will be making additional investments in talent

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 30 | 5 6


development amounting to €450 million to the end of 2030 (of which €275 million go to Brainport)
and €80 million annually thereafter. The TU Eindhoven will contribute considerably to the Project,
establishing 140+ additional scientific staff positions, 15 new MSc tracks, new semiconductor
labs and a new clean room. Through effective recruitment campaigns and scholarships TU
Eindhoven anticipates growing the student enrolment by 1900 in 2300, leading to 900+ graduates
annually from 2030 onwards.


Pilot projects to demonstrate solutions to specific issues related to the workforce often (i) have
somewhat opportunistically-composed project teams with participants from across Europe; and
(ii) in view of the restricted funding will inevitably have a limited scope. If judged successful upon
completion the project team will compete for scale-up or - at best - continuation funding. But
such an approach will not be sufficient to meet the complex, tenacious and urgent challenges
which the semiconductor sector has faced across Europe in terms of workforce development.
The Project Beethoven is a “lighthouse” project that deserves to be replicated in regions with a
similar semiconductor “talent ecosystem” with high growth needs such as Saxony, Crolles,
Catania, Northern Italy, Ireland.

### _2.3.2. Looking Ahead_


One of the aims of the network of competence centres, established under the Chips Act by Chips
Joint Undertaking (Chips JU), is to ‘ _address the knowledge and skills shortage and mismatch by_
_attracting, mobilizing and retaining new talent on research, design and production and supporting_
_the emergence of a suitably skilled workforce in STEM’_ _[23]_ _._


The European network of Chips Competence Centres (aCCCess) brings together around 30
competence centres, in close coordination with Chips Pilot Lines, and the Design platform.
Among its five thematic focus groups, the Training and Skills Development groups is tasked with
mapping available training opportunities, creating and promoting a European training catalogue
and facilitating SMEs access to relevant education and training offers.


Each national competence centre acts as a “one-stop shop”, a unique connection point between
companies, research institutions and academia. They accumulate resources for semiconductor
development, provide companies with access to technical knowledge and training such as
hands-on training for professionals, orientation activities for young talent, and reskilling and
upskilling initiatives for the existing workforce.


While the national Chip Competence Centres already cooperate within a common network,
coordination of joint activities remains complex. Theres is a clear **need for harmonised**
**curricula and standardised micro-credential system** to ensure mutual recognition of training
across borders. The idea of developing a pan-European educational programme in collaboration
with the aCCCess network may seem promising; however, it would require substantial additional
resources and staffing to be implemented effectively.


Within the framework of the NanoIC pilot line project, a skills-related workstream addresses
workforce development, with a focus on (i) bridging the gap between academic knowledge and
industrial needs; and (ii) growing the cohort of experts with an industry mindset. Research
centres Imec and Tyndall offer (i) internships and dual-learning programs for students from


[23 Chips Act (2023/1781), article 5(d) and article 4(d). URL](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1781/oj/eng)


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 31 | 5 6


regular curricula at Master’s and PhD level; and (ii) expert courses and bootcamps for faculty on
beyond-2nm advanced semiconductor technologies. These offerings will be supported and
expanded through cooperation with the Chip Competence Centres


By establishing national Chip Competence Centres and **aligning their activities at the European**
**level**, the EU can potentially address growing skills shortages and surpluses within the EU by
creating a more balanced semiconductor talent pipeline across regions. This way, the Chip
Competence Centres will have a central role in implementing the Act’s skills and workforce
development agenda.


_**2.3.2.1.**_ _**Paving the Way for a Skilled European Semiconductor Workforce**_

Addressing the semiconductor talent shortage across the value chain has become a matter of
strategic importance, if Europe wants to regain and defend its competitive position. The skills gap
has been widening over many years and in spite of a plethora of laudable initiatives – at regional,
national and European level – the general impression is that – even against the background of the
industry’s uncertainty and volatility – the problem has remained excruciatingly constant and - if
anything - is becoming more pressing.


Most if not all current or planned workforce initiatives make a valuable contribution to at least
one aspect of growing the semiconductor workers’ pipeline. But a **coordinating body** with
sufficiently large authority, outlining an _integrated_ approach and setting clear KPIs for the various
action lines is missing. The number of additional workers or students on the “demand side”
should be quantified clearly and set along a specific timeline. The actions on the “supply side”
(undertaken or being planned) should be classified according to a timeline (short-term, mediumterm or long-term effect); to resources required (budget, staff, infrastructure); and to impact (Ex.
number of additional students registered; number of workers reskilled or hired).


According to these challenges, SEMI Europe has determined three sets of recommendations
below, which aim to provide a coherent strategy for semiconductor skills development in Europe.
The three sets of recommendations are complementary and provide an EU-wide framework to
harmonise efforts to tackle skills shortages at different governance levels.


2.3.2.1.1. A new Chips Skills Academy Umbrella Organisation


Under the Chips Act 2.0., the European Commission must suggest _**creating a fully realised**_
_**Chips Skills Academy umbrella organisation**_, that is endorsed under the Chips Act 2 and
recognised by all relevant stakeholders, including the Chips Competence Centres. The Academy
shall coordinate joint initiatives and efforts aimed at bridging the skills gap in the semiconductor
industry and carefully consider the following points:


Use the earmarked ‘digital skills academies’ call under Digital Europe to build on existing

initiatives and to ensure the coordinating nature of the Academy.
The Academy should install a permanent Chips Skills Observatory at EU level. The

observatory should provide regular updates on the skills needs across the EU – broken down
to regional level and monitor KPIs towards progress.
In its governance structure the Academy should comprise of a high-level body dedicated to

semiconductor skills and workforce development. This board should integrate and upgrade
all existing structures, such as the Pact for Skills Executive Board, the Skills working group of
the industrial Alliance or the Board of the ESCA project.


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 32 | 5 6


Ensure that the Academy is closely linked to the national chips competence centres. The

Academy should provide services to the competence centres to facilitate their efforts on
skills - such as certification, summer schools and materials for image campaigns. At the
same time the competence centres as well as the other initiatives funded by the Chips JU or
the Microelectronics IPCEI should contribute to the Academy. To strengthen the role of Chips
Competence Centres in delivering targeted training programs and outreach initiatives. They
should be further empowered to act as regional and national semiconductor knowledge
hubs, as well as coordinate with education and industry to create and distribute specialised
training.


2.3.2.1.2. A European Chips Education Roadmap


The European governance structure of the Chips Act does not fully reflect skills needs of the
industry. Neither the Chips JU nor the European Semiconductor Board currently address skills
with dedicated structures or strategic processes or roadmaps. Within the realm of the Chips
Skills Academy, industry, academia and government agencies should co-develop and regularly
update a chips education roadmap. This roadmap should provide a longer-term guidance for
upcoming European calls, initiatives as well as recommend national and regional actions. In
order to ensure a comprehensive, future-proof strategy, the roadmap should consider at least the
following intervention points along the semiconductor talent pipeline:


**Growing the STEM talent pool**, targeting young people in primary and secondary school.

Sustained intervention in this area is essential for safeguarding the long-term talent pipeline
as these efforts will come to fruition only 10 to 15 years after implementation. Failure to
address systemic challenges in STEM education from an early age will ultimately limit the
prospective recruitment pool as the growth of graduates in semiconductor related disciplines
is stagnating as well as overall population growth. On the one hand this can mean direct
involvement of industry in schools, however initiatives which can support current and future
teachers will act as multipliers for the next generation.


**Encouraging the student-population** (university and higher technical education) **towards**

**semiconductor-related degree paths and industry careers.** Building on a strong STEM
talent pool, the industry must continue to ensure access and visibility of attractive career
opportunities. Many projects currently active on this topic pay particular attention to this
subset of the talent pipeline as results can be realised in a relatively short period of time. Data
on the shocking lack of graduates with relevant degrees who ultimately do _not_ find their way
into the semiconductor industry speaks to the need to improve the image of the sector and
the mechanisms by which new graduates and young professionals develop their careers. For
example, this includes better career guidance at university level – if professors and
counsellors are unaware of the opportunities it is difficult to expect students to find them
wholly on their own – or summer schools / boot camps and similar activities which offer a low
barrier to entry for students and introduce them to a wide spectrum of paths. Vocational
education should also receive particular attention to harmonise quality standards across
Member States and increase the appeal of VET programs by creating financial and social
incentives such as scholarships, housing grants, and language support.


**Expanding available talent sources and retaining current workforce.** It is imperative to

make targeted interventions to triage the most pressing workforce needs. Actions which can


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 33 | 5 6


manifest concrete results within a relatively short time horizon (1-5 years) include
streamlining visa procedures for job profiles in critical demands and investing in training
programs which target transferable skills in adjacent industries who can be effectively retrained for semiconductor careers. The industry can also benefit enormously from tapping
into unrecognised or underrepresented populations, for example liberalising hiring processes
to include non-traditional educational backgrounds with relevant skills. Finally, upskilling
those currently active in the sector is a meaningful way to ensure the workforce adapts to
technological changes and can enable productivity increases. Recent research has pointed
out that while 74% of manufacturers are looking at upskilling existing workers as a strategy to
address labour shortages, 67% of manufacturing workers are not satisfied with the existing
training programs [24] .


2.3.2.1.3. National Education Roadmaps


Under a Chips Act 2 strategy the European Commission should strongly _**encourage the member**_
_**states to**_ _**establish education roadmaps as part of national chips strategies**_ . The various
Ministries of Education throughout Europe should commit to contributing to the Academy and
the Skills Observatory providing, on a regular basis, data for the student population in secondary,
higher and adult education. The national education roadmaps should show clear links to the
Chips Academy and other European initiatives. At the regional level, it is strongly advised that all
stakeholders allocate sufficient resources to workforce development efforts, including the
monitoring of supply and demand, in the areas that benefit from Chips Act funding. New
investments necessarily will bring future workforce demands which are important to account for
in tandem with any infrastructure development.


To effectively implement the European Semiconductor Skills Strategy, ensuring Member

States adoption of coherent national roadmaps or actions plans that reflect the alignment of
common priorities. It may include but is not limited to integrating semiconductor-related
skills into curricula at all educational levels, from as early as secondary and elementary
school to higher education and vocational training, as well as expanding and aligning funding
streams, and common monitoring of progress on the implementation of the strategy.
At the regional level, it is strongly advised that all stakeholders allocate sufficient resources

to workforce development efforts, including the monitoring of supply and demand, in the
areas that benefit from Chips Act funding. New investments necessarily will bring future
workforce demands which are important to account for in tandem with any infrastructure
development.
Encourage Member States to implement a common accreditation and recognition system for

semiconductor education (covering university and VET degrees, as well as microcredentials). A harmonised accreditation framework would improve transparency of skills
and facilitate inter- and cross-border mobility.

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 34 | 5 6


There has been a continuing expansion of tertiary education over the last decade across the

EU. In 2023 the tertiary educational attainment rate of 25-34-year-olds was 43.1% and the
EU-level 2030 target for that share is at least 45% [25] . Tertiary educational attainment varies a
lot within countries, with regional differences pronounced (higher in more developed regions
than in less developed ones). This creates imbalances in the availability of highly qualified
people across regions, undermining economic, social, and territorial cohesion. Similarly,
having a tertiary degree is less common in rural areas (31.7%) than in cities (53.3%).




## **2.4. Pillar III - Coordination and Crisis Management**

Pillar III of the European Chips Act establishes a comprehensive policy framework for monitoring
semiconductor production capacities and implementing crisis response measures in the event
of actual or potential supply disruptions within the Union. Under this framework, the European
Commission and Member States, acting through the European Semiconductor Board (ESB), may
activate a _crisis stage_ when necessary. Once activated, the Commission is empowered to: 1)
request companies to share information about their operations; 2) require them to prioritise
orders for crisis-relevant products (priority-rated orders); and 3) conduct joint procurement on
behalf of several Member States for critical semiconductor products needed by essential
sectors. To further strengthen the EU’s crisis preparedness and response, Pillar III also introduces
a strategic mapping mechanism designed to closely monitor the semiconductor value chain
across Europe.


Since the adoption of the Chips Act in 2023, the European Union has not faced any
semiconductor shortages severe enough to endanger its local ecosystem. Consequently, the
crisis stage and its related response measures have not yet been activated, and their efficiency
and effectiveness remain untested. Nonetheless, the European Commission has made **steady**

**progress in establishing its strategic mapping and monitoring system**, including the
development of early warning indicators. This system will be instrumental in enabling Europe to
swiftly identify and respond to emerging risks in the global semiconductor supply chain, allowing
policymakers and industry stakeholders to take proactive and well-coordinated risk management
measures.

### _2.4.1. An Optimised Public-Private Monitoring Collaboration_


The strategic mapping of the semiconductor industry aims to identify Europe’s main strengths
and weaknesses within the global semiconductor value chain, highlight key market actors, and
assess potential risks to the resilience of the European semiconductor ecosystem. To achieve
this, the European Commission is collaborating with private partners – including the
semiconductor industry through the Industrial Alliance on Processors and Semiconductor
Technologies – as well as with external experts. This collaboration must ensure an efficient and
well-balanced allocation of resources to effectively deliver on Pillar III objectives.


Within this framework, the Alliance’s Working Group on Supply Chain (SCWG) has been entrusted
by the Commission and the European Semiconductor Board (ESB) with developing monitoring
and mapping tools, along with related guidance. The SCWG is currently working on the creation
of a _Digital Twin_ that will mirror and map the current structure and latest developments of
Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem. To guarantee acce **ss to accurate and up-to-date**
**information**, a dedicated survey group has been established to build and maintain a
comprehensive database of Europe’s semiconductor capacities across all segments of the value
chain. This database will form the foundation for future periodic and continuous stress tests
assessing vulnerabilities and dependencies within the EU supply chain, thereby directly
contributing to the objectives of Pillar III.


In parallel, the European Commission has internally operationalised its _Supply Chain Alert_
_Notification_ (SCAN) System — an indicator-based mechanism designed to monitor market
dynamics and supply chain developments. SCAN enables the tracking of trade flows for sensitive
and critical items, such as semiconductors. The Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) has
notably published a working paper demonstrating the application of the SCAN methodology to
the semiconductor supply chain. However, the system remains restricted to internal use within
the Commission and is currently inaccessible to external stakeholders, despite its potential value
for identifying strategic bottlenecks and monitoring the semiconductor value chain. The ongoing
collaboration between the European Commission, the Industrial Alliance, and private experts
should therefore continue in a manner that ensures a **coherent and efficient allocation of**
**resources,** supporting the delivery of a comprehensive and adaptable monitoring system.

This section presents an overview of key policy instruments and strategic initiatives that are
potentially relevant for Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem, highlighting their objectives,
benefits, and lessons from international case studies. Starting from an examination of tax credits,
exploring their design, eligibility, and effectiveness in promoting investment and R&D activities,
particularly for large companies, SMEs, and start-ups. The section then addresses the specific
needs of smaller actors in the semiconductor sector, presenting tailored measures to improve
access to pilot lines, reduce financial and administrative barriers, and foster inclusive growth and
innovation.


Furthermore, the section reviews prominent international approaches, including **Japan’s**
**Rapidus consortium, the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, and South Korea’s K-Chips Act**,
illustrating how public-private collaboration, strategic subsidies, and targeted incentives can
accelerate R&D, manufacturing, and technological leadership. These case studies provide
insights for the **EU’s replicability** and the design of future policies to strengthen Europe’s
semiconductor capabilities, particularly through coordinated public-private investments,
infrastructure support, and the development of advanced pilot lines.


Finally, the section explores cross-cutting enabling factors that are critical for the success of
Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem. These include **guarantees on water and energy supply**,
the establishment of a **coordinated governance structure**, and the integration of **economic**
**security considerations** into semiconductor strategy.

## **3.1. Tax Credits**

### 3.1.1. Overview of Instrument


Tax credits are a type of financial incentive provided by governments to reduce the amount of tax
that a company owes to the local government. These are widely utilised by governments to reduce
the tax burden on businesses, thereby attracting greater investments towards the domestic
economy. Tax credits typically target investments towards specific business activities, including
R&D, manufacturing and workforce training, and thus may be subject to specific eligibility criteria
and application procedures.

### 3.1.2. Industry Benefits


Tax credits can be highly beneficial for large companies, particularly when it comes to alleviating
operating expenditures (OpEx), by reducing the amount of tax owed and providing immediate
financial relief. On the other hand, their effectiveness is limited for start-ups and scale-ups,
where their revenues and profits streams are often not sufficient to fully benefit from tax credits.


While tax credits can serve as a valuable tool to encourage investment and support business
growth, they cannot, on their own, sustain or stimulate the broader industrial ecosystem. For


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 37 | 5 6


start-ups and scale-ups, the absence of immediate revenue streams means that tax credits may
not provide the necessary financial support. For this reason, tax credits need to be strategically
designed and complemented by other supportive instruments, including grants, subsidies, or
access to venture capital, in order to create a more holistic and sustainable environment for
these emerging businesses to thrive.


Refundable or carry-forward tax credits can provide significant benefits for start-ups, allowing
them to receive a refund or carry unused credits forward when they are not yet profitable. This
flexibility can offer immediate relief and support their growth in the early stages. However, the
design and targeting of tax credits are crucial factors in determining the beneficiaries. If not
carefully designed, tax credits may not support the businesses that need them most. Therefore,
**the way in which tax credits are structured and targeted plays a key role** in ensuring that both
established companies and emerging start-ups benefit from these incentives.

### 3.1.3. Case Studies


The **U.S. CHIPS and Science Act** in the U.S. includes a 25% tax credit for investments in
semiconductor manufacturing facilities [26] . The tax credit, estimated at USD 46 billion, is designed
to attract private investment into semiconductor manufacturing, boosting domestic production.
This measure complements the grants, loans, and loan guarantees that are also allocated under
the Chips Act. These tax credits aim to alleviate part of the sizeable costs associated with setting
up semiconductor manufacturing facilities, thus enabling companies to invest in cutting-edge
technologies and infrastructure in the U.S.


**South Korea’s K-Chips Act** introduces a tiered tax credit system designed to attract domestic
and foreign investments towards South Korea’s semiconductor ecosystem [27] . The tax credit rate
for facility investments has been raised from 15% to 20% for large and medium-sized enterprises,
and from 25% to 30% for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while R&D tax credits were
extended until 2031 to further strengthen R&D capabilities.

### 3.1.4. EU Replicability


The EU does not have direct competence over tax policy, meaning EU-level tax credits are not an
option, however, the EU can establish guidelines and provide incentives within the state aid rules.
This could be reinforced under the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI)
framework and within the revised Chips Act. In this context, it is crucial for the EU to create the
necessary framework conditions that allow national governments to design and use tax credits
as a policy tool to foster growth and innovation within their semiconductor ecosystems.

## **3.2. Specific Measures for SMEs, Start-ups and Scale-ups**

### 3.2.1. Overview of Instrument

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startups require specific, tailored measures
adapted to their size and scale of business operations. These measures should be designed to
support their growth and address their specific challenges, including high costs, excessive
administrative burden, limited revenues and profits streams.

### 3.2.2. Industry Benefits


Tailored measures for SMEs and startups can make it more affordable for smaller companies to
access semiconductor pilot lines and cutting-edge R&D facilities. Lowering these entry costs
allows start-ups to conduct trials, develop prototypes, and refine their technologies without the
financial strain typically associated with these processes. Additionally, streamlining
administrative processes and providing targeted public funding, including grants and tax
incentives, can simplify engagement with government-backed facilities and funding programs.


Therefore, reducing these financial and bureaucratic barriers can enable start-ups and SMEs to
thrive, fostering greater innovation and competitiveness. This targeted support can also help
create a more level playing field, allowing smaller players to benefit from technological
advancements alongside the established industry leaders.

### 3.2.3. Case Studies


**South Korea’s K-Chips Act** offers tax incentives specifically tailored for SMEs, with increased tax
credits for facility investments (Up to 30% for SMEs) and extended periods for R&D tax credits [28] .
Additionally, South Korea’s government has launched further initiatives, including a USD 750
million fund dedicated to assisting fabless companies and equipment manufacturers, which also
supports smaller players across the semiconductor supply chain.


**Japan’s semiconductor strategy** promotes SME participation in the supply chain by offering a
mix of subsidies and financial incentives. On 13 [th] June 2025, Japan’s Cabinet approved the annual
Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal Management and Reform, which [reafirmed its commitment](https://www5.cao.go.jp/keizai-shimon/kaigi/minutes/2025/0606shiryo_01.pdf)
to large-scale production of next-generation semiconductors through capital investment,

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 39 | 5 6


infrastructure development, design support and workforce development [29] . The strategy aims to
establish a domestic ecosystem, comprising chip design and manufacturing, server operations
and AI technological sovereignty. Under this strategy, the government is seeking to encourage
SME participation in the supply chain through regional consortia and ongoing private-sector
engagement.

### 3.2.4. EU Replicability


The EU should adopt a model that better supports start-ups and SMEs in the semiconductor
sector, introducing greater simplification and addressing key concerns from smaller players,
particularly with regards to the administrative burden and long procedures for the industrial pilot
lines.


In the current framework, the costs to access pilot lines for SMEs, start-ups, and scale-ups are
prohibitively high as these actors often lack dedicated funding and project teams, forcing them
to outsource applications and reports to costly consultancies. This financial burden discourages
participation, effectively excluding them from benefiting from Pillar I advancements and
reinforcing the existing barriers to innovation. Based on our previous assessment in Section 2,
SEMI Europe suggests the following:




## **3.3. Japan’s RAPIDUS Model**

### 3.3.1. Overview of Instrument

Japan has worked to develop its own advanced semiconductor technologies with the creation of
Rapidus, founded in 2022 as a consortium of eight major Japanese companies, including Toyota,
Sony, and NTT, aiming to develop and mass-produce advanced 2-nanometer semiconductors by
2027. Rapidus aims to enter the advanced-node foundry business, with its focus on building both
domestic R&D and manufacturing capabilities. The company employs a dual-track strategy:
collaborating with Japan’s Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Centre (LSTC) and
partnering with global leaders like IBM and IMEC for technology licensing and joint research.


[29 Japan’s Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal Management and Reform 2025. URL: https://www5.cao.go.jp/keizai-](https://www5.cao.go.jp/keizai-shimon/kaigi/minutes/2025/0606shiryo_01.pdf)
[shimon/kaigi/minutes/2025/0606shiryo_01.pdf](https://www5.cao.go.jp/keizai-shimon/kaigi/minutes/2025/0606shiryo_01.pdf)


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 40 | 5 6


Rapidus is currently constructing a 2nm pilot production line in Hokkaido, with plans to begin
mass production by 2027.


The Japanese government has committed substantial resources to Rapidus. In April 2024, the
Japanese government announced an additional subsidy of JPY 590 billion (approximately USD 3.9
billion) to Rapidus, supplementing the USD 2.2 billion allocated in 2022. In March 2025, it
announced an additional subsidy of USD 5.54 billion for Rapidus, which includes funding for both
front-end advanced semiconductor processes (USD 4.7 billion) and back-end processes such as
packaging and testing (USD 0.88 billion). Japan’s government has since outlined, in May 2025, its
future semiconductor policy, centred around full-scale support and strict monitoring of the
Rapidus project in order to meet the 2027 target date.


The Rapidus approach can be considered a strategic, collaborative approach designed to foster
national leadership in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, bringing together major industry
players, collaborating to advance the development and production of next-generation
semiconductor technologies. Central to this model is the combination of private sector efforts
with large-scale public support, with substantial public investments to support R&D and
infrastructure.

### 3.3.2. Industry Benefits


The industry benefit of the Rapidus approach to national semiconductor advancement is its
ability to strengthen cutting-edge technological leadership, foster industry-wide collaboration,
and drive economic growth, ultimately benefiting all participants within the national
semiconductor ecosystem.


This inclusivity not only drives innovation but also provides SMEs with access to vital resources,
infrastructure, and funding, enabling them to scale-up within the semiconductor industry. If
successful, the approach would further solidify the country’s position as a global semiconductor
hub, attracting investment, talent, and forging international partnerships that reinforce its
technological and economic standing.

### 3.3.3. EU Replicability


While the direct replication of the Rapidus model may not be fully applicable to the EU context,
the EU could adapt this approach and encourage European Semiconductor Consortiums in
critical value chain segments where European capacities are needed and which offer significant
opportunities for growth and matter to the bloc’s technological sovereignty. In this regard, the
ESMC joint venture provides a useful blueprint. Europe could bring together national
governments, research institutes, and industry leaders to co-invest (Public-private partnership)
in critical technologies needed in Europe.


Furthermore, Europe could also adapt the Rapidus model by leveraging IMEC’s NanoIC pilot line
to develop a central hub for advanced semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, with the
involvement of key European players across the semiconductor supply chain. The success of the
initiatives would ultimately require strong leadership and coordination (Governance structure) to


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 41 | 5 6


ensure a coherent strategic direction or otherwise result in uncoordinated and inefficient
projects.

## **3.4. Water and Energy Supply Guarantees**

### 3.4.1. Overview of Instrument


Ensuring reliable water and energy supplies is essential for semiconductor manufacturing, given
its highly resource-intensive processes. Governments can address this by upgrading the relevant
infrastructure and securing the necessary investments from regional authorities on the one hand,
and EU Member States on the other. Targeted investments in specific areas would help maintain
and expand the availability of water and energy to meet the growing demands of the
semiconductor industry.

### 3.4.2. Industry Benefits


Guaranteed water and energy supplies provide stability to the semiconductor industry by
preventing supply chain disruptions that could halt production. Reliable access to these
resources is vital for maintaining consistent output, particularly in regions with limited
infrastructure or specific resource challenges, including but not limited to Grenoble, Malaga,
Dresden and Catania.

### 3.4.3. Case Studies


**South Korea’s K-Chips Act** includes plans to improve infrastructure, including the water supply
and power systems around key semiconductor hubs (Ex. Pyeongtaek and Yongin), where new
large-scale semiconductor fabs are under construction [30] . South Korea’s National Assembly has
also passed three energy-related acts, aiming to tackle key energy supply issues, and ensuring
that nuclear power plants at risk of closure can continue operating until 2030 [31] . These laws are
part of a larger strategy to foster the growth of South Korea’s energy-intensive semiconductor
industry, by securing a stable and adequate energy supply.

### 3.4.4. EU Replicability


It will be essential for future EU water and energy policy to explicitly reflect the unique
requirements of the European semiconductor industry, given its strategic importance and

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 42 | 5 6


resource-intensive nature. With the advancement of the green transition and the Clean Industrial
Deal, policy implementation should include targeted measures that enable the semiconductor
sector to address its water and energy challenges while progressing toward sustainability goals.


This should involve integrating semiconductor manufacturing into broader infrastructure
planning, incentivising the adoption of energy-efficient and water-recycling technologies, and
ensuring that regulatory frameworks support both environmental objectives and industrial
competitiveness.

## **3.5. Chips Act Governance Structure**

### 3.5.1. Overview of Instrument


The major semiconductor initiatives around the world have been supported by robust
institutional frameworks that allow for greater coordination between industry and government
priorities. Public administrations have established dedicated agencies or inter-ministerial bodies
with specialised staff and strategic planning capabilities to oversee investments, R&D programs,
and respond to market or geopolitical shifts.

### 3.5.2. Industry Benefits


Dedicated government agencies and bodies provide industry with clear points of contact,
streamlined regulatory guidance, and coordinated support for R&D and investment initiatives.
The alignment of public resources and government planning with industrial priorities can reduce
uncertainty, accelerate project execution, and enable companies to scale innovation more
efficiently while navigating complex policy and security requirements.

### 3.5.3. Case Studies


Under the **U.S. CHIPS and Science Act**, the White House has centralised decision-making by
creating the Subcommittee for Microelectronics Leadership within the President’s National
Science and Technology Council [32] . This subcommittee is responsible for shaping the national
strategy on microelectronics research, development, manufacturing, and supply chain security.
Additionally, the White House formed the CHIPS Innovation Steering Council to oversee and
coordinate the development and implementation of policies necessary for the effective
execution of the CHIPS Act within the executive branch.


[32 CHIPS and Science Act (Public Law 117–167), U.S. Congress. URL: https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346/text)
[congress/house-bill/4346/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346/text)


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 43 | 5 6


### 3.5.4. EU Replicability

The EU could strengthen existing bodies like the European Semiconductor Board (ESB) by
incorporating stronger and more systematic representation from industry, ensuring that decisionmaking reflects the practical needs and priorities of semiconductor companies.


Furthermore, a renewed commitment to the Alliance on Processors and Semiconductor
Technologies (ALLPROS) would provide a structured forum for continuous dialogue between
policymakers and industry stakeholders, helping to align EU strategies with technological trends
and market realities.

## **3.6. Economic Security in the Chips Act**

### 3.6.1. Overview of Instrument


National semiconductor strategies and economic security policies can be effectively integrated
as part of a broader strategic policy nexus. This integration is critical for ensuring that
semiconductor production and other strategic supply chains remain resilient, competitive, and
aligned with national interests in a rapidly changing global context. Given the strategic
importance of semiconductors across vital sectors (Ex. Defence, telecommunications, energy
and AI), governments must consider their semiconductor strategies not in isolation, but as part
of a larger framework focused on economic security, technological sovereignty, and geopolitical
stability. This is especially the case nowadays, where semiconductors are at the centre of global
geopolitical competition, with major players working to secure supply chains and leveraging their
strengths to exert pressure on competitors.

### 3.6.2. Industry Benefits


Integrating industrial policy with broader economic security objectives provides companies with
a relatively more stable and secure business environment. Considering the current extent of
global geopolitical competition, a more coordinated policy can strengthen supply chain
resilience, support companies in navigating export controls and facilitate access to critical raw
materials. Particularly in the sphere of semiconductors, this integrated approach will be
fundamental to ensure competitiveness and economic security simultaneously.

### 3.6.3. Case Studies


Under the **U.S. CHIPS and Science Act**, the White House has centralised decision-making by
creating the Subcommittee for Microelectronics Leadership within the President’s National


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 44 | 5 6


Science and Technology Council [33] . Complementing this, the CHIPS Innovation Steering Council
to oversee and coordinate the development and implementation of policies necessary for the
effective execution of the CHIPS Act within the executive branch. These structures are crucial to
align national security and technological competitiveness objectives, providing the U.S.
government with a comprehensive strategic view on its semiconductor industry.

### 3.6.4. EU Replicability


The EU could adopt a more integrated approach by ensuring that the updated Chips Act is aligned
with the EU’s economic security strategy. This would include strategic measures to reduce
external dependencies and increase Europe’s technological sovereignty in critical sectors. With
the forthcoming Economic Security Doctrine to be presented by DG TRADE before year end, there
is an opportunity for the EU to more explicitly integrate semiconductors withing the EU’s
economic security strategy thinking. Based on our assessment in Section 4, SEMI Europe
suggests the following:


[33 CHIPS and Science Act (Public Law 117–167), U.S. Congress. URL: https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346/text)

4.


The European Chips Act should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a **broader policy**
**ecosystem** in which complementary legislation can significantly influence its implementation
and outcomes, both positively and negatively.


**Vertically**, the Chips Act must be supported by a robust policy framework that guarantees a
coherent budget aligned with its ambitions, an enabling environment that strengthens Europe’s
attractiveness to both domestic and foreign investors and a stable global trade environment and
steady supply of critical minerals.


**Horizontally**, market demand must be stimulated to absorb future semiconductor production
capacities and unlock new investment opportunities. If the supply and demand of advanced
semiconductor technologies do not align, the European Chips Act fund will bring limited benefits
to the EU. So far, the lack of market demand is the primary concern when exploring the possibility
of investing in Europe and building new facilities. The market uncertainties revolving around the
European market have disincentivised companies to invest in Europe.

## **4.1. Vertical Alignment – Policy Foundations for Semiconductor** **Growth**


Vertically, the Chips Act must be supported in terms of financial, market and trade measures.
Building synergies across these policies is essential to foster a competitive and resilient
semiconductor ecosystem in Europe.

### _4.1.1. Multiannual Financial Framework and European Competitiveness_ _Fund (2028-2034)_


The European Commission’s proposal for the 2028–2034 Multiannual Financial Framework
(MFF) and the creation of the European Competitiveness Fund (ECF) represent a pivotal
opportunity to strengthen Europe’s technological and industrial base. SEMI Europe welcomes
the ECF’s focus on simplifying access, increasing coherence, and introducing flexible financial
tools. However, to ensure real strategic impact, the EU must clearly prioritise **semiconductors**
within the ECF, recognising their foundational role in all major industrial sectors and their
importance to Europe’s digital sovereignty.


To close the investment gap with the U.S. and Asia, SEMI Europe calls for a **dedicated**
**semiconductor budget** that sends a strong signal of commitment towards this critical industry.
In this context, the EU should ensure **harmonised coordination** between Horizon Europe and
the ECF to create a seamless “ **lab-to-fab-to-market** ” pathway, allowing continuous support
from research through industrial deployment. This is especially important given that the success
of pilot lines will depend on companies’ ability to **absorb and scale RTO-developed**


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 46 | 5 6


**technologies**, which remains prohibitively expensive for SMEs and start-ups. Policy measures
should therefore focus on **cross-segment R&D collaboration** to accelerate technology transfer
and reduce the industrialisation gap.


Furthermore, a funding programme tailored to SMEs within the ECF should be created to provide
equity-based financing, easier access to first-of-a-kind facilities, and simplified application
procedures. To ensure long-term impact, the EU should also establish a **sustainable governance**
**and funding structure for pilot lines** - ensuring their viability beyond initial Chips Act funding
and enabling them to become self-sustaining innovation hubs integrated with industry demand.


Finally, SEMI Europe calls for a comprehensive approach to infrastructure, sustainability, and
resilience. The ECF should prioritise investment in **power, water, and transport infrastructure**
for semiconductor clusters, support **PFAS substitution and circular manufacturing**, and create
a **Supply Chain Resilience Facility** to strengthen access to **critical raw materials** . By
strategically aligning the Chips Act and the ECF, Europe can build an integrated, competitive, and
future-proof semiconductor ecosystem that can enhance sustainability and innovation.




### _4.1.2. Capital Markets Union_

The Capital Markets Union (CMU) is a key EU initiative aimed at **integrating and deepening**
**Europe’s financial markets**, **reducing fragmentation**, and improving **access to finance** for
companies across the continent. By harmonising rules, simplifying cross-border investment, and
fostering a more diversified funding ecosystem, the CMU seeks to complement traditional bank
lending with robust venture, growth, and equity financing.


In this context, Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem faces a critical challenge in its ability to scale
up **breakthrough innovations to large-scale industrialisation and commercialisation** . The
Capital Markets Union can play a critical role in bridging this gap by providing harmonised, crossborder access to financing that complements traditional bank lending. By enabling startups and
scale-ups to tap into venture, growth, and equity capital across the EU, the CMU can help Europe
translate its R&D strengths into commercially viable semiconductor technologies and
technology-focused chip solutions (Ex. AI, quantum, renewables, EVs).


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 47 | 5 6


A fully functional CMU would also help create a more dynamic and vibrant venture capital
ecosystem in Europe, similar to that which drives US semiconductor innovation. Today, Europe’s
venture funding is fragmented across national borders and often risk-averse, limiting the ability
of startups to scale rapidly. By **integrating capital markets, harmonising investment rules, and**
**facilitating cross-border flows**, the CMU would attract larger pools of private investment willing
to support high-risk, high-reward projects. This would allow European semiconductor innovators
to grow faster, commercialise advanced chips at scale, and capture value domestically, ensuring
that breakthroughs in advanced technologies, HPC, and leading-edge semiconductors remain
anchored in Europe.

### _4.1.3. Global Trade and Economic Security_


The semiconductor industry depends on an intricate global supply chain spanning multiple
continents. This interconnectedness makes it particularly vulnerable to trade and geopolitical
tensions. In recent years, countries have increasingly used trade policy as a strategic tool to
advance industrial and security objectives, often at the expense of open markets and global
cooperation. As a result, Europe faces a more fragmented, politicised, and uncertain global trade
environment. The European semiconductor ecosystem is considerably influenced by these trade
and geopolitical instabilities, and the upcoming Chips Act 2.0. must be framed with regards to
these challenges.


_**4.1.3.1.**_ _**Global Trade Tensions**_


4.1.3.1.1. EU-US Trade Dispute


As the European Union is holding close negotiations with the United States to find the future
terms of their partnerships, the European Union has given **careful attention to the**
**semiconductor industry and the strong global interdependencies** underpinning its value
chain. The latest US-EU framework agreement of August 21, 2025, has most notably capped U.S.
tariffs on EU-originating semiconductors at a maximum of 15%. The measure is meant to hold
regardless of the future results of the Section 232 investigation on semiconductors and
manufacturing equipment. A potential exemption for semiconductor manufacturing equipment
is also included in the agreement.


The EU-US agreement has defined the framework of the tariff negotiations, but numerous
challenges are still paving the way to a final trade agreement. The **steel and aluminium tariffs**
imposed by the U.S. under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act continue to affect transatlantic
trade and have direct implications for the semiconductor industry. Semiconductor companies
are facing **complex due diligence** required to determine the precise steel and aluminium
content in products exported to the US. While the direct impact on chipmakers is minimal,
suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment face **tens of millions of euros in**


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 48 | 5 6


**compliance costs** . These challenges stem from reliance on third-party suppliers across different
jurisdictions, limited transparency due to confidentiality and intellectual property constraints,
and the administrative burden of collecting sensitive data, all of which weigh heavily on
profitability and competitiveness.


The U.S. Steel and Aluminium Tariffs directly hinders European companies’ ability to compete on
the global market. Given that semiconductor-related equipment often costs several million
euros, suppliers are **unable to absorb such price increases** and are therefore compelled to pass
these additional costs on to their customers.


4.1.3.1.2. China’s Export Controls


China has responded by introducing its own export controls on rare earths and critical minerals.
In April 2025, China expanded its Export Control Law to include seven additional rare earth
elements (dysprosium, gadolinium, lutetium, samarium, scandium, terbium, and yttrium) further
tightening its control over critical inputs for semiconductor and high-tech manufacturing.


These measures marked the third round of Chinese export restrictions following earlier controls
on gallium and germanium in late 2024 and early 2025. The new restrictions are used in metals
and specialised magnets made from these rare earths, which are used in motors, transistors, and
components of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Given that China is the sole or
dominant global supplier for most of these materials, the move significantly heightens concerns
about Europe’s supply security and long-term industrial resilience.


If export controls persist or intensify, **medium- and long-term disruptions** could emerge,
particularly for R&D, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and advanced packaging. The
European semiconductor value chain faces specific challenges in **tracing the origin and content**
of these materials. Supply-chain opacity, driven by intellectual property protection and
commercial confidentiality, makes it difficult to anticipate disruptions or identify exposure to
restricted inputs. This lack of transparency also complicates compliance with export control
regimes and hampers strategic planning.


Gallium and germanium remain particularly sensitive due to their critical role in semiconductor
performance. Although the semiconductor sector uses relatively small quantities, the absence
of substitutes and China’s dominant global share (over 90% for gallium and 83% for germanium [34] )
expose the industry to systemic risks. Together, these developments underline the **growing**
**geopolitical fragility** of Europe’s semiconductor supply chain and reinforce the need for
diversification, strategic stockpiling, and deeper alignment between international trade policies
and industrial policies such as the forthcoming Chips Act 2.0 and the Critical Raw Materials Act.

SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 49 | 5 6


_**4.1.3.2.**_ _**EU Economic Security Strategy and Doctrine**_

The next iteration of the EU Chips Act should not only focus on boosting manufacturing capacity
and R&D but also on mitigating trade-related vulnerabilities. The Act should be better aligned with
the EU’s broader Economic Security Strategy and the forthcoming Economic Security Doctrine,
particularly in three key areas: export controls, foreign direct investment (FDI) screening, and
outbound investment monitoring.


4.1.3.2.1. Screening of Foreign Direct Investments


The ongoing review of the EU’s FDI Screening Regulation risks introducing additional
administrative layers that could undermine Europe’s investment attractiveness compared to
faster and more predictable systems in major semiconductor regions such as South Korea and
Taiwan. SEMI Europe stresses that the framework should support, not hinder, the Chips Act’s
objectives by **facilitating high-value foreign investment** and **technology partnerships**
essential for scaling Europe’s semiconductor capabilities.


Excessively rigid deadlines and broad notification obligations, as proposed by the European
Parliament, could delay decisions on acquisitions, joint ventures, and R&D partnerships that the
Chips Act tries to incentivise. SEMI Europe supports the Council’s position to exclude greenfield
investments and to limit the Regulation’s scope to dual-use and military goods, avoiding
unnecessary coverage of low-risk sectors. Likewise, Annex II should focus only on investments
involving export-controlled or defence-related items, or include narrow, clearly defined sectoral
criteria to ensure predictability.


To provide legal certainty, the definition of “control” should align with that used in the EU Merger
Regulation and the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, ensuring consistency across instruments.
Policymakers should also consider how ongoing EU-US trade negotiations and tariff discussions
might influence the design of the new FDI framework, particularly in sensitive technology sectors
like semiconductors.


4.1.3.2.2. Outbound Investment Screening


While attention to outbound investments is part of Europe’s growing economic security focus,
SEMI Europe underlines that outward FDI plays a crucial role in strengthening the
competitiveness of the European semiconductor industry. Outbound investments enable
European firms to access new markets, expand production capacity, and participate in
international R&D ecosystems, all of which reinforce long-term economic resilience. Many
European semiconductor companies have built significant operations in China, particularly in the
automotive chips segment, which represents an essential market and innovation base.


SEMI Europe supports a **risk-based and proportionate approach** that would allow companies
to **maintain global partnerships** while addressing **legitimate security concerns** . SEMI Europe
supports a ‘China-for-China’ strategy, enabling firms to maintain separate operations in China to
serve the local market without undermining European technological leadership or security
interests.

4.1.3.2.3. Export Control Framework


As demonstrated in the recent German Microelectronics Strategy, which hints at stricter,
continuously updated export controls and research-security measures across microelectronics,
there is increasingly a clear will from Member States to prevent critical technology leakage and
misuse. The proliferation of national export control frameworks, however, may inhibit the
formation of a **cohesive EU-level approach** .


SEMI Europe strongly supports better coordination at EU level on the export controls of dual-use
items and a clearer, harmonised definition of controlled goods. SEMI Europe encourages the
development of a single, **unified EU risk assessment system**, replacing the current patchwork
of national regimes that create uncertainty and administrative burdens for exporters. Such a
system would facilitate compliance and provide predictability for semiconductor companies
operating across multiple Member States.


A harmonised European approach to export controls would also strengthen the EU’s position
globally, ensuring that its measures are coordinated and proportionate, rather than reactive to
unilateral U.S. actions such as the 2022 export controls on advanced semiconductor equipment.
This would help protect Europe’s technological competitiveness while ensuring the responsible
trade of sensitive technologies.

## **4.2. Horizontal Alignment – Cross-Industrial Coordination**


Crucially, the Chips Act should be horizontally aligned with other EU industrial and technology
policies such as for quantum and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to ensure strategic
coherence and favour cross-market alignment.

### _4.2.1. Technological Prioritisation_


The design of the Chips Act 2.0. must be performed in accordance with the European Union’s
technological priorities set in third industrial and tech legislations, ensuring that these initiatives
are mutually reinforcing each other and well-coordinated. **Technological priorities** are driven by
future market needs, such as AI, quantum, automotive, or energy technologies, but also factors
related to strategic autonomy, supply chain resilience, economic security, and geopolitical
leverage. Such a focus will help guide investment and innovation towards areas of strategic
importance, ensuring that the industry is competitive in emerging fields.


Third countries have already defined their priorities for the semiconductor industry. China has,
for instance, prioritised advanced semiconductor technologies crucial for AI and high-bandwidth


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 51 | 5 6


memory (HBM), addressing bottlenecks that have historically constrained its industry. Going a
step further, Taiwan has decided to combining semiconductor and AI technologies to develop
innovative applications across multiple sectors such as food, medicine, and transportation.
Industrial policies in the field of semiconductors were adopted accordingly.


By aligning EU semiconductor policies with the future demand for critical technologies like AI,
quantum, automotive, and energy, the EU could create a more focused and competitive industry.
This would require a thorough **assessment of Europe’s strengths and market needs** over the
next decade to identify the most promising areas for investment. It will be important for the EU to
clearly define which semiconductor technologies and segments of the semiconductor value
chain it aims to support, as part of discussions on the updated Chips Act. This work must
consider the whole value chain necessary to the supply of these priority technologies and not
only their final producer. These discussions must take account of Europe’s prosperity,
indispensability and resilience.

### _4.2.2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)_


The EU AI Continent Action Plan and AI Package are strategic initiatives to strengthen Europe’s
technological sovereignty, aiming to deliver investments in AI factories, AI gigafactories and
sustainable data centres, which will ultimately generate **sustained demand for** **leading-edge**
**semiconductor technologies** produced in Europe. While these initiatives anticipate strong
synergies between the semiconductor and AI sectors, realising this potential depends on creating
an enabling environment that promotes coordination and collaboration across these industries.


The expansion of AI factories, AI gigafactories, and sovereign data centres will dramatically raise
Europe’s demand for cutting-edge semiconductors such as high-performance GPUs, AI
accelerators, advanced logic, power-efficient memory and interconnect technologies. Each
large-scale AI facility may require hundreds of thousands of advanced chips, creating a powerful
domestic demand driver that can justify and sustain local semiconductor R&D and
manufacturing investments. This scale of computing infrastructure, if paired with the EU Chips
Act, can anchor Europe’s next wave of semiconductor production capacity.


However, this opportunity comes with critical **implementation challenges** . Europe must secure
sufficient access to manufacturing at advanced process nodes, ensure supply of critical
materials and packaging capacity, and expand its design and verification ecosystem. Building AI
infrastructures also places intense pressure on **energy availability, sustainability, and cooling**
**systems**, areas where chip design efficiency and data-centre hardware innovation are closely
intertwined. Without coordinated planning, Europe risks increasing dependency on the very


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 52 | 5 6


chips that power its AI infrastructure, missing the chance to capture the full industrial value
chain.


For these reasons, targeted investments towards leading-edge semiconductor capacity are
essential if Europe is to reduce dependency on non-EU suppliers and power its own AI
infrastructure with **European-made technology** . This requires scaling up Chips Act pilot lines
towards higher TRL levels (7 to 9) and supporting their industrialisation, strengthening design
ecosystems and fostering partnerships with all the key players across the supply chain.

### _4.2.3. EU Quantum Strategy and Quantum Act_


The EU Quantum Strategy and the proposed Quantum Act represent critical steps to position
Europe as a global leader in quantum technologies. Over the past decade, initiatives such as the
Quantum Flagship have nurtured European startups enabling primitive industrial deployment of
superconducting quantum computers and other platforms. With a growing demand for quantum
processors, the strategy emphasises transitioning from lab-scale experiments to large-scale,
commercially viable quantum systems. This includes the Quantum Europe Research and
Innovation Initiative, the Quantum Chips Industrialisation Roadmap, and a network of openaccess testbeds. They are designed to accelerate innovation, industrialisation, and adoption
across sectors including AI, HPC, materials science, finance, and defence. The semiconductor
industry is a critical enabler of this transition.


Superconducting quantum processors rely on traditional semiconductor manufacturing
techniques, but with unique materials satisfying precise technical requirements, including for the
reduction of interferences in qubits operations. These specificities in quantum chips require
accurate adaptation of the equipment and materials used in their production as well as the use
of new materials in quantum chips. The upcoming Quantum Act will deliver support for research
and industrialisation of quantum technologies. **Chips Act 2.0 must be** **closely coordinated and**
**articulated with the future quantum initiatives** to avoid duplicative measures and overlapping
instruments, notably for quantum chips development and industrialisation. Given that SMEs and
start-ups dominate the quantum business landscape, further alignment will be required to
ensure both instruments include specific funding and scale-up support for European quantum
chip developers.


The equipment and tools used in the development of quantum technologies are similar and have
low usage rates. This makes it possible to share these tools among multiple start-ups, notably via
a foundry-style approach. In practice, this foundry model for quantum chips could be achieved
by the creation of a dedicated quantum chip production facility in Europe. Such a facility will de
facto qualify as FOAK under the second pillar of the Chips Act and be eligible for receiving state


SEMI Europe | Chips Act Report 53 | 5 6


aid. Instead of strictly defining the boundaries between the Quantum Act and Chips Act, a flexible
approach will ensure that quantum chips projects contributing to EU-wide capacity building can
benefit from multiple European policy instruments and supportive measures.


By **aligning the Chips Act 2.0 with the Quantum Act**, Europe can create a coordinated
ecosystem where public funding, industrial-scale semiconductor infrastructure, and startup
innovation work together. This integration ensures that quantum chip manufacturing benefits
from established semiconductor know-how, fosters a secure and sovereign supply chain, and
strengthens synergies between classical and quantum computing.
