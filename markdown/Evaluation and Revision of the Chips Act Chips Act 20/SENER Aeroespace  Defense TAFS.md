feedback: As OEM, integration is the critical convergence point where semiconductors,
  PCBs, substrates, and advanced packaging become mission-ready systems. For Space
  and Defense, this capability ensures security, reduces supply chain vulnerability,
  and supports innovation in high-density, high-reliability electronics. Satellites
  and defense platforms require assemblies that operate in harsh environments and
  address new challenges such as thermal and mechanical management for components
  with increasing power dissipation and I/O density. Chips Act 2 must therefore recognize
  OEM integration as a strategic pillar, allocate dedicated funding for interdependent
  technologies like PCBs and packaging, and invest in next-generation integration
  processes such as robotics, AI-driven testing, and eco-friendly solutions. It should
  also align with other on-going European initiatives to strengthen the entire electronics
  ecosystem. Without secure and coordinated development of these capabilities, Europe
  cannot achieve true technological sovereignty or protect its leadership in critical
  sectors for decades to come.
