feedback: Building Europe's semiconductor ecosystem will not get along without a significant
  change in keeping the growth and maintenance of talents. The Chips Act 2 strategy
  should include a significant campaign to support the interest of the young generation
  in studying technical disciplines, not only electrical engineering, but also physics,
  chemistry, mechanical engineering and, of course, mathematics. The campaign must
  significantly affect young people already in primary and secondary schools, where
  their interest in their future profession is formed. It is necessary to look for
  attractive forms such as promotional excursions to universities and top scientific
  workplaces, excursions to research and development workplaces of industrial enterprises,
  discussions at schools with prominent personalities of the scientific and technical
  environment. For young people, it is necessary to organize summer schools of electrical
  engineering and other technical disciplines. At primary, secondary and higher education
  institutions, it is necessary to strongly support the participation of pupils and
  students in regional, national and international competitions in technical disciplines.
  The education system must receive adequate resources, both financial and human,
  for these activities. The whole of society needs to understand the strategic necessity
  of preparing the next generation of European technical intelligence. Europe's technical
  intelligence needs not only to be nurtured, but also to be maintained. Within individual
  EU countries, but also at the pan-European level, it is necessary to support the
  emergence of start-ups and SMEs, where new talent will find sufficient opportunities
  and employment. Start-ups and SMEs are essential for the recovery of the semiconductor
  industry in Europe. EU countries should help the developing industrial ecosystem
  by promoting and supporting the market demand for their innovative products. One
  of the forms of support is for example to co-finance their participation in international
  exhibitions and fairs, creating a shared infrastructure where start-ups and SMEs
  can test their innovations, create prototypes and test their features. Existing
  successful semiconductor and engineering companies should create or initiate an
  attractive social background for new talents and their young families in their area.
  The state should support such initiatives through tax policy.
