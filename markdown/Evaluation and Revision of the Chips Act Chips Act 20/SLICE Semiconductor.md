feedback: To date the EU chips act has made good progress towards the goal of achieving
  greater semiconductor sovereignty for Europe, which is so vital in today's geopolitical
  / technological climate. Pivotal to this is fostering semiconductor startups / SME's.
  To this regards, and as a founder of small Irish based semiconductor start up, I
  would like to see more funding make its way down to more start ups / SME's. In addition,
  I would like to see more funding granted towards the open source silicon ecosystem
  as it is a key enabler to cash strapped semiconductor startups / SMEs.
