**Re: Comments of the Semiconductor Industry Association on the European**
**Commission’s Public Consultation and Call for Evidence for Review of the Chips Act**
**(Chips Act 2)**

The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the
European Commission’s _Public Consultation and Call for Evidence_ _for the Review of the Chips_
_Act (Chips Act 2)_ . The revision of the EU Chips Act represents an important opportunity for the
European Commission and its Member States to strengthen both semiconductor supply chains
in Europe and globally.


**1. Background**

SIA has been the voice of the U.S. semiconductor industry for nearly half a century. Our
member companies represent more than 99 percent of the U.S. semiconductor industry by
revenue. Many of SIA’s U.S.-headquartered companies have operational footprints throughout
Europe, contributing to Europe’s innovation ecosystem and supporting the resilience of
semiconductor supply chains in Europe. SIA also represents major non-U.S. chip firms,
including major European-headquartered chipmakers, toolmakers, and cutting-edge research
and development centers. Collectively, our members are engaged in the full range of research,
design, manufacture, and back-end assembly, test, and packaging of semiconductors. More
information about SIA and the semiconductor industry is available at www.semiconductors.org.

Strengthening semiconductor supply chains around the world is a top priority for SIA and its
members. In that vein, we support the revision of the EU Chips Act and the practical need for
EU action in light of the importance of semiconductors to economic security. We further
appreciate the European Commission’s recognition of the global nature of semiconductor supply
and value chains, but also its appreciation of the importance of demand to support the scale of
investments in semiconductor capacity.

In Section B of the Call for Evidence, the European Commission outlines two key objectives for
its revision of the EU Chips Act, namely to:


i. reduce the EU’s dependency for leading-edge chips, by increasing the EU’s
manufacturing capacity in advanced semiconductors for critical sectors; and


ii. increase its insight into the resilience of key market actors, supply chains, and the
overall EU semiconductor ecosystem to better position the institution to be able to
monitor the ecosystem, be able to guarantee security of supply, and better prepare for
potential crisis responses.

Please find below general comments on the EU Chips Act Revision, specific comments with
respect to each objective outlined in the Call for Evidence, and recommendations for additional
objectives.

**2. General Comments**

SIA and our member companies stand ready to help inform the European Commission’s
approach to its review of the EU Chips Act. As a general matter, we urge the Commission and
other key stakeholders involved in developing and implementing an updated Chips Act to
engage with the private sector throughout the policymaking process. Regular dialogue with
private sector leaders and experts will help to ensure European semiconductor policy is
informed by those with industry and technical expertise and focused on addressing Europe’s
competitiveness gap, building on European strengths, and identifying areas of critical and
strategic technologies where Europe has the capacity to lead. It will also help to ensure
Europe’s policy objectives are appropriately targeted and guided by market realities – namely
that there must be a sustainable business case for semiconductors capacities to increase in
Europe, whether in R&D, design, or manufacturing.

The EU Chips Act established the European Semiconductor Board (ESB) in Pillar III, [1] which
serves as a governance mechanism for the implementation of the legislation and information
exchange and coordination with EU Member States. However, the coordination and governance
mechanism of semiconductor policy through the ESB does not appear to be functioning as
intended. The European Commission should reform the structure of this mechanism to include
industry engagement as the primary method of obtaining market insights, including trends and
market demand, to inform policy action. We do appreciate that the Commission has now
established the Industry Advisory Group (IAG) and encourage continued constructive dialogue
between the ESB and IAG. However, this dialogue with industry involvement is important to
ensuring that industry needs are properly reflected and prioritized.

In addition, access to talent is a necessary precondition to growing the European ecosystem
and remains a challenge. We encourage the inclusion of this issue within the purview of the
IAG, as part of its efforts aimed at enhancing Europe’s global competitiveness. The European
Commission should consider appropriate mechanisms to maximize the impact of efforts
advanced by the European Commission, Member States, and industry, as well as the academic
and training sectors, to grow the semiconductor talent pool and enhance the attractiveness of
careers within the sector. We also think it will be important to explore talent exchanges with
partner countries – such as the United States – and opportunities to streamline requirements
and process to attract and retain foreign talent.

In addition, Competence Centers must foster greater collaboration to align their expertise with a
unified EU semiconductor strategy, avoiding duplication and ensuring clear objectives. Creating
a network that offers international mini-degrees and targeted training, informed by trade
associations, will help address emerging skills gaps. In addition, promoting awareness and
diversity, especially among youth and females, through professional branding and marketing
initiatives, is vital for building a sustainable talent pipeline. It is also important for Competence
Centers to submit self-sustainability plans by the end of their initial public funding round to

ensure long-term viability. To support early-stage operations, the European Commission should
consider exceptions to state funding rules or other alternatives, allowing advance payments for
Competence Centers that lack other income sources.

Finally, the European Commission should simplify and streamline regulations to facilitate
expansion of operations already in Europe, and to attract new investments. As outlined in a
2024 report by SIA and the Boston Consulting Group, companies seek investment locations
where approvals and permitting processes are streamlined and can be expedited in accordance
with project timelines. [2] We invite the European Commission to review the recommendations in
that report, which include eliminating redundant requirements and harmonizing environmental
standards, among others.

An updated Chips Act and Europe’s broader industrial policy should work in conjunction with
European foreign trade and economic security policy, competition policy, and innovation policy.
The effectiveness of the Chips Act as an industrial policy tool will only be successful if it
harmonizes with other policies. These policies should complement each other to amplify their
impact.

**3. Specific Comments**

We offer the following specific comments on the revision of the EU Chips Act.


**3A. Comments on Objective 1, Reducing EU Dependencies**

To accomplish objective (i) outlined in the Call for Evidence, the European Commission
suggests the EU Chips Act could be amended “to bring forward the strategic nature of design
and manufacturing capacity of both leading-edge chips and legacy chips on which Europe is
overly dependent on third countries, and define strategic projects to implement this policy, and
their selection criteria.”

As a starting point, we think it is important to take stock of Europe’s existing strengths in the
semiconductor technology ecosystem. As emphasized in Mario Draghi’s report “The Future of
European Competitiveness” (hereafter referred to as the “Draghi Report”), Europe leads in key
segments of the chips supply chain, including “sensors, power controls, and mature chips for
car microcontrollers and peripherals”, electronic design automation, equipment (e.g. lithography
machines and deposition), key materials (e.g. substrates and gases), and testing. [3] We
encourage the EU to leverage and build on these strengths, in cooperation and partnership with
non-European allies like the United States, recognizing that technological autarky is neither
practical or possible.

As the European Commission and EU Member States consider such amendments to the EU
Chips Act, it will be important to take account that the semiconductor industry has developed a

global supply chain based on increasingly exacting technical requirements and complex
economics, which require firms to achieve economies of scale to support massive capital
investments. [4] SIA has consistently underscored that chipmakers need confidence there will be
sufficient customer demand to justify and support any new long-term, capital-intensive
investments in semiconductor production. To that end, and to the extent the European
Commission seeks to invest in new chip production – regardless of product type or process
node – it will be important to identify and cultivate demand-side drivers, as well as to address
non-market policies and practices in the sector that divert market demand to players that may
artificially suppress prices. We recommend the European Commission work on these issues in
concert with partners and allies, including the United States.

We note the EU seems particularly concerned with addressing dependencies on leading-edge
chips. We urge the European Commission to look at the semiconductor ecosystem in its totality,
and apply the demand-side drivers approach to their initiatives for bringing leading edge
production to Europe. In particular, the Commission could broaden the scope of the First-of-AKind (FOAK) instrument (Pillar II) to additional segments of the ecosystem, including
technologies already present in Europe. The purpose of this tool is to support boosting Europe’s
technological capabilities across the board, and to boost competitiveness across segments by
fast-tracking state aid for new technologies. The FOAK tool should include other segments of
the ecosystem (such as equipment and materials) and should ensure that technologies already
existing in Europe are eligible, with a focus on areas where Europe has a competitive
advantage and where a business case in Europe can be justified. The expansion of the FOAK’s
scope will also encourage strong international partnerships by integrating new players into the
European semiconductor ecosystem.

An area worth particular focus in the EU Chips Act 2 is the back-end ATP segment of the
semiconductor supply chain. The majority of ATP capacity currently resides in Northeast Asia,
with a significant and growing concentration in China (See Figure 1). [5] As recent developments [6]
have underscored, there is an acute need to diversify ATP activities globally. We thus encourage
the European Commission and its Member States to address supply dependencies in the ATP
segment of semiconductor supply chains as part of the revision of the EU Chips Act. This
means investing in domestic capacity where it makes sense, and we note the Draghi report
recommends “coordinating EU efforts in back-end 3D advanced packaging, advanced materials
and finishing processes.” [7] It will also be important to re-route critical supply chains through allied
and partner countries where European capacity may not be practical or economical. To do this,
we recommend closer coordination with reliable partner governments and dedicated foreign
assistance efforts to build supply chain capacities in third countries that complement and
support semiconductor operations in Europe.

We likewise recommend the EU encourage greater investment in semiconductor design. As the
Commission recognizes in its Call for Evidence, demand for leading-edge chips “is currently
limited and does not justify the large-scale investment needed for a typical leading-edge fab.”
Cultivating a greater ecosystem of chip design in Europe would help to drive greater demand for
building leading-edge capacity in Europe. We note the Draghi report recommends “providing
grants or R&D tax incentives for “fabless” companies active in chips design and foundries in
selected strategic segments.” [8]

In particular, strengthening the links between design platform participants and the venture
capital and funding ecosystem will help identify and support high-potential companies. Selection
criteria should be broader to include both technology readiness and thorough venture capital
due diligence. Furthermore, expanding the technology focus to encompass photonics, advanced
nodes such as 3nm and 2nm chips, and chiplets will ensure the EU Chips Act remains at the
forefront of innovation. Adapting the funding model to support larger investments in intellectual
property (IP), electronic design automation tools, and silicon for complex designs will also
enhance the competitiveness of European enterprises.


**3B. Comment on Objective 2, Monitoring and Economic Security**

The European Commission underscores its need for greater insight into the resilience of key
market actors, supply chains, and the semiconductor ecosystem in the EU and elsewhere. To

accomplish this objective, the European Commission, in its call for evidence, suggests the EU
and its Member States could enhance data-gathering tools, including by imposing mandatory
reporting requirements on industry. The goals of such data collection, according to the Call for
Evidence, include being able to guarantee security of supply, address disruptions and crises,
and better understand the susceptibility of key market actors to technology leakage risks.

Any such survey imposes a significant burden on industry players. Such data collection efforts
should be deployed only when absolutely necessary, and with a view to minimizing the
administrative burden and time required for industry players to collect such information. Should
the European Commission seek to collect information from both semiconductor industry players
and downstream customers, it will be important to clarify that any such survey is intended to
assess the data and knowledge available within an individual organization, and respondents
should not reach out to suppliers to provide information for any mandatory government data
collection effort. Such an approach will help to limit the burden on semiconductor players. [9]

Should the European Commission choose to proceed with imposing mandatory surveys or data
collection, we strongly urge the EU and its Member States to consult closely and collaborate
with industry on the content of any such survey, and to understand the level of business
sensitivity of any data it seeks to collect _**prior**_ to the release of any such survey or data
collection effort; it will also be necessary to ensure any such effort is consistent with safeguards
and data protections that are crucial for maintaining the technological leadership of
semiconductor companies operating in Europe. SIA would be pleased to consult with the
European Commission on any such efforts, as we have done with the U.S. government in its
past data collection efforts.

Semiconductor companies consider information about their supply chains—including materials
suppliers and other vendors, customers, etc.—as sensitive information and/or IP. Secure IP
protection is crucial for semiconductor innovators facing trade secret thefts from cross-border
misappropriation, corporate espionage, and cyber-intrusions, among other forms. It will be
important for the European Commission to determine how any proprietary and business
confidential information collected via mandatory surveys will be stored and safeguarded. For
example, centralizing this information within the EU may create unintended vulnerabilities,
increasing a company’s exposure to trade secret theft. The European Commission should
carefully consider the impact and mitigation of these risks, including whether the EU and its
Member States have the necessary systems and personnel to safeguard proprietary information
and ensure any data collection effort clearly articulates the requirements for the Commission
and Member States to protect and limit the dissemination of business confidential information.


**3C. Comments on additional recommended objectives for EU Chips Act Revision.**

We note Section A of the Call for Evidence articulates a third objective for which the current EU
Chips Act “lacks sufficiently effective tools to overcome”, namely the need to address the “nonmarket policies and practices in third countries” that pose challenges to Europe’s competitive
edge in mainstream/legacy semiconductors. This third objective is not listed as a key objective
for the revision of the Chips Act. However, we are of the view that addressing this challenge as
part of the EU Chips Act will help ensure that the two aforementioned objectives in the Call for
Evidence can be accomplished. We invite the European Commission to review SIA’s previous

comments in numerous public documents [10] on the impacts of non-market policies and practices
on the semiconductor industry in the United States and global semiconductor industry. In
particular, SIA requests the European Commission take note of the recommendation on behalf
of the semiconductor industry for likeminded partners and allies to pursue a sectoral agreement
on semiconductor technologies. We look forward to engaging with the European Commission
on this topic upon request.

**4. Conclusion**

Global challenges are best addressed through coordinated, multi-country solutions. Accordingly,
we urge the European Commission to coordinate its semiconductor policies with allies and
partners to build international partnerships and avoid pursuing isolated goals. Such partnerships
will help reduce dependencies and build more resilient supply chains for the long term. SIA and
our member companies appreciate the opportunity to share our views on the revision of the EU
Chips Act and stand ready to engage constructively to advance our shared goals of building
greater resilience in European and global semiconductor supply chains.
