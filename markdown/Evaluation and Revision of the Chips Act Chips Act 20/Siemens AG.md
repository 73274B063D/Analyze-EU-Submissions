**Executive Summary**

Siemens is uniquely positioned in the global semiconductor and electronics ecosystem.
Siemens;

  - designs its own chips and develops and manufactures electronics for its own
products,

  - is a large-scale user of semiconductors produced by others,

  - is a key supplier of electrification, automation, digitalization and decarbonization
solutions to the semiconductor and electronics ecosystem,

  - is one of the top three globally leading EDA tool provider and the only tool provider
from complex system level down to integrated circuits with the strongest footprint
in Europe.

This paper outlines Siemens' position on the EU Chips Act 2.0 with the following policy
recommendations:




   - Pave the way for industrialization in Chips JU projects by involving large end-users
from critical EU sectors (e.g., automotive, industrials, robotics, aerospace/defense,
life sciences, energy) with attractive funding schemes.

   - Improve the "lab-to-fab" concept to support both small-volume series production
and mass production, ensuring direct industry involvement, including end-users,
IDMs, and foundries.

   - Expand Pillar 2’s focus beyond frontend activities to address the broader supply chain
including chip design, design enablement, backend activities and substrates/PCBs.
In Pillar 2, address and secure the needs of end-users relying on mature chips.

   - Provide public funding to existing semiconductor fabs and foundries via Pillar 2 to
leverage Industrial AI accelerating productivity, digitalization and energy-efficiency
to remain competitive.

   - Redefine Pillar 3's focus to address politically driven challenges and restrictions on
hardware/software technologies, moving beyond traditional supply-demand
imbalances.

   - Develop diverse reliable partnerships to secure access to all essential chip
technologies (design tools, backend/frontend manufacturing, substrates/PCBs) for
end-users.

   - Refrain from imposing additional reporting burdens and mandatory
sensitive/confidential information sharing on the semiconductor ecosystem.

   - Increase the EU Semiconductor Board's visibility and foster regular, continuous
engagement with industrial stakeholders, including end-users, to strengthen the
ecosystem and develop a unified strategy.


The following part provides further details of Siemens’ position on the EU Chips Act 2.0, based
on the current 3-pillar structure.


November 2025 1


**Comments on Pillar 1 and IPCEIs**

**Industrialization & end-user involvement:** The Chips JU initiative needs to strategically drive
the industrialization of emerging technologies with attractive public funding (like quantum
technologies, photonics, neuromorphic computing) where Europe can play a key role. This
requires prioritizing solutions for real-world challenges, ensuring **scalability from R&D to**
**industrial production**, and crucially, **involving large end-users from key EU sectors** (e.g.,
automotive, industrials, robotics, aerospace/defence, life sciences, energy...) early in the
project lifecycle to define needs and guide development.

**Improvements for "Lab-to-Fabs":** The "lab-to-fab" concept needs improvements to move
beyond research and pre-development to **support small-volume series production and mass**
**production**, requiring direct industry involvement, including end-users, IDMs and foundries.


**Competence Centers’ focus:** Such centers should adopt **a more focused, localized approach,**
tailored to specific Member State needs, and actively support the valorization of Chips JU
research results at local level.

**Attractiveness of Chips JU projects:** While Chips JU successfully supports even very large
project consortia to grow ecosystems, its attractiveness should be improved with higher
funding rates for all participants.

**Streamlining IPCEIs:** The process for IPCEs is overly complex and lengthy. The 2021 IPCEI
communication needs revision to **allow faster approvals**, based on the current global market
realities. A more centralized EU-level strategic framework and significant **EU budgetary**
**contributions** will be essential for future IPCEIs in semiconductors.

**Comments on Pillar 2**

**Europe’s semiconductor resilience** : The concept of resilience in the semiconductor industry
extends far beyond the singular focus on frontend activities and increasing domestic wafer
manufacturing capacity. **Broader supply chain security, including but not limited to** c **hip**
**design, design enablement and backend activities and substrates/PCBs,** will be essential
for Europe’s semiconductor resilience, therefore should be within the scope of Pillar 2.

**Focus on European end-users’ needs:** Public authorities’ initial and largely current focus on
leading-edge chip production in Europe overlooks the needs of end-users who also rely on
mature chips. Pillar 2 should address European end-users’ actual and future chip needs.

**Leveraging Industrial AI** : The Chips Act 2.0 is well-positioned to support **"Industrial AI"** in the
EU semiconductor ecosystem (in particular in materials, equipment, IDM and foundry
segments). In this regard, Pillar 2 could be extended to support schemes targeting existing
semiconductor fabs in Europe to **leverage Industrial AI (including digital threads)** in boosting
productivity, electrification, automation, digitalization, and energy-efficiency to increase
Europe’s competitiveness.

**Substrates/PCBs:** A chip, no matter how advanced, needs to be integrated into a system. PCBs
are fundamental for packaging, interconnectivity, and the overall performance of electronic
devices. Recognizing Europe's vulnerability in substrates/PCBs, Pillar 2 must operate beyond
silicon manufacturing and **support resilient supply chains with innovation and investment**
**in substrates/PCBs** in Europe.


November 2025 2


**Chip design and design enablement:** Pillar 2's scope must be extended beyond wafer
manufacturing and **broadened to design centers. Public funding should be provided for**
**future and current fabless companies.** Such design centers should also receive support to
access advanced EDA tools as well as incentives to use advanced foundry services (EU and nonEU) for prototyping and small-volume production. A new model for small-volume foundry
access, like TSMC's "Value Chain Aggregators," which bundles orders and ensures design
compliance, would be important to consider.

**Pooling EU, national and private resources:** Strengthening the EU semiconductor ecosystem,
as Mario Draghi emphasized, requires **increased EU-level resources and a dedicated budget**
**for Pillar 2 projects and IPCEIs.** The proposed EU Competitiveness Fund is ideally positioned
to manage these resources, complementing national and private financing.

**Comments on Pillar 3**

**Shortages:** Pillar 3's current **focus on traditional "chip shortages" is insufficient** **for**
**politically driven challenges**, where restrictions on hardware/software technologies are more
complex than simple supply-demand imbalances. Pillar 3’s current framework fails to detect
such political events, leaving Europe vulnerable. And reactive intervention by public authorities
after semiconductor crises is often too late and disruptive.

**A new Pillar 3 approach:** A crucial starting point is acknowledging that full autonomy or
autarky in semiconductors is unattainable for Europe, as it is for other global players. The
economic realities and cost structures of specific manufacturing segments, particularly for lowend chips and backend activities, mean **Europe will continue to depend on external chip**
**technologies** . To master this intricate global landscape, Pillar 3 should also focus on
**developing robust and diversified partnerships** with countries globally to maintain and
facilitate further access to semiconductor and electronics technologies.

**Building reliable partnerships:** A fundamental redesign in Pillar 3 is needed, cultivating
diverse **global partnerships with complementary strengths** . The focus should be on **securing**
**access to all semiconductor and electronics technologies** (design tools, frontend/backend
manufacturing…) for end-users through strong, reliable partnerships with diverse third
countries, in particular in the APAC region.

**Reporting and information sharing:** Any new measures must rely on publicly available data
or voluntary sharing of non-confidential information. Industry rejects mandatory disclosure
(e.g., supply/demand planning) due to **risks of exposing confidential** or highly sensitive
business data, creating competitive harm and increasing vulnerability to trade secret
misappropriation and economic espionage. Furthermore, **additional reporting burdens** for
the semiconductor ecosystem must be avoided. Finally, **interpreting** complex, context-specific
supply chain **data** **requires deep industry expertise**, lack of which comes with the **risk of**
**counter-productive policy interventions** by public authorities. This makes voluntary,
collaborative approaches far more effective than mandatory reporting.

**The EU Semiconductor Board:** The Board's limited visibility impedes collaboration with
industrial stakeholders. Greater transparency with regular and continuous engagement with
industry (including end-users) is crucial for strengthening the European semiconductor
ecosystem and developing a comprehensive, unified European strategy.
