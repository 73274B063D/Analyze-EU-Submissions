feedback: Joint recommendations of the SILICON ALPS Cluster, representing over 140
  Austrian semiconductor stakeholders67% of them start-ups and SMEsfor the European
  Chips Act 2.0. The recommendations focus on strengthening Europes semiconductor
  competitiveness by addressing structural gaps, empowering innovation-driven SMEs,
  and expanding Europes technological and industrial sovereignty. Austrias semiconductor
  ecosystem combines strong design expertise, emerging fabless companies, advanced
  research institutions, and a growing talent base. To fully leverage this potential,
  Chips Act 2.0 must provide simplified access to funding, foster demand for European
  technologies, reduce supply-chain vulnerabilities, and support a coordinated pan-European
  skills and innovation framework. Key objectives include reinforcing Europes global
  competitiveness through balanced support across design, manufacturing, materials,
  and packaging; supporting the strategic value of the European fabless model; improving
  private capital mobilization; and broadening the semiconductor value chain to passive
  components, equipment, packaging, and system integration. Start-ups and SMEs require
  targeted support to translate technological innovation into market-ready products.
  Priority measures include strengthened accelerators, subsidized access to advanced
  design and prototyping tools, open-source PDKs and RISC-V technologies, tape-out
  co-funding, and shared test and validation infrastructure. Such instruments will
  accelerate time-to-market, reduce development risks, and stimulate entrepreneurial
  growth. To close Europes skills gap, the cluster recommends merging existing educational
  initiativesincluding GreenChips-EDU, Unite!, and TRANSFORMinto a pan-European Knowledge
  and Innovation Community (KIC Chips). A microcredentials framework should support
  lifelong learning, labour mobility, and transparent recognition of semiconductor-relevant
  skills. Regulatory complexity remains a major barrier for SMEs. Enhanced state-aid
  schemes, simplified fast-track applications, cascade funding, regulatory sandboxes,
  and clearer long-term guidance are needed to improve access and reduce administrative
  burdens. The European Competitiveness Fund should implement SME-friendly financing
  instruments, including equity matching, milestone-based co-investment, revenue-sharing
  models, tax incentives, and support for capital-intensive hardware development.
  Stronger governance and coordination are essential. Regional clusters should be
  integrated directly into decision-making bodies such as the Chips Joint Undertaking
  and the European Semiconductor Regions Alliance. Demand-side incentivesespecially
  in automotive, energy, telecommunications, healthcare, and defenceshould stimulate
  early adoption of European chips through procurement frameworks and co-development
  programmes. Strategic opportunities for Europe include integrated photonics, edge
  AI, sustainable AI hardware, RISC-V, critical materials, equipment development,
  packaging, and substrates. Accelerated standardization processes and harmonized
  permitting procedures are crucial to lowering market-entry barriers and reducing
  delays in scaling production capacity. Overall, the recommendations call for a coherent,
  SME-centred Chips Act 2.0 that builds on regional strengths, improves Europes innovation-to-market
  capabilities, and transforms semiconductor research excellence into sustainable
  industrial leadership.

# **Joint recommendations for the public participation process of** **the European Chips Act 2.0 from SILICON ALPS Cluster GmbH** **representing the Austrian semiconductor ecosystem with a fo-** **cus on Start-Ups and SMEs.**

## **Introduction and context**

This document is the common result of a consultation process within the SILICON ALPS Cluster network. With a **focus on Start-Ups and SMEs** we collected feedback and recommendations from our members. SILICON ALPS Cluster represents a strong semiconductor network
within **Austria with 140 members** from academia, industry and public authorities.

Our main goals art to boost competitiveness and innovation performance of our members.
Silicon Alps Cluster helps to consolidate and strengthen a high-tech ecosystem in Carinthia
and Styria, turning these regions into significant hubs for electronics and microelectronics in
Austria. Approx. **67% of our members are Start-Ups and SMEs** and are the backpone of
our network in the region. In a coordinated manner we collected feedback and input for the
public consultation process for the Chips Act 2.0.

Furthermore Silicon Alps Cluster **fully supports the positon paper** from the Austrian large
enterprises in semiconductors including the position paper of the **European Semiconduc-**
**tor Association (ESIA) as well as the position of the Autrian Federal Economic Chamber**
**(F33113690).**

## **The recommendations objectives are outlined as follows**

The main objective of the joint recommendations for Chips Act 2.0 is to present a comprehensive overview of the Austrian start-up and SME ecosystem that complements the broader
European industrial context. This proposal aims to support the development of a coherent
and efficient operational framework aligned with the sector’s actual capabilities. In pursuit
of this goal, the following strategic objectives are proposed:


**a)** **Enhancing Europe’s global competitiveness**


by fostering a more balanced integration of advanced design, manufacturing, and ma
terial capabilities, while placing a strong emphasis on R&D excellence and providing

targeted support for technology-driven enterprises.


**b)** We recognise the strategic value of the **European fabless model** in enabling agility,

reducing capital expenditure and focusing resources on design excellence and custom

solutions. Intellectual property (IP) and design are crucial for the growth of the future

ecosystem.


**c)** **Boosting private investment**


By the Etsblishment of a strong effective System to enable the pairing of Public Invest
ments like the Chips fund with Private Equity Instruments. We would like to encorage

a focus on accelerator systems for scale ups.


**d)** **Strenghtening the Value chain**


widening the value chain within the measures in Chips Act II by integrating the ele
ments of passive components, equipment manufactorers, packaging and system in
tegration up to the application fields will strengthen Europes power in the

semiconductor business.


**e)** **Reducing Supply Chain risks**


Remaining risks in the European semiconductor supply chain should be reduced by

broadening the focus on sensitive areas like OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assem
bly test) for the semiconductor-dependent industries (e.g. automotive, aerospace, mil
itary, medical and others).


**f)** **Closing the skills gap (EIT chips)**


The skills gap should be addressed massively by a strong programme. A possible so
lution could be seen in a future KIC-Chips (in a future EIT call in 2027)

## **Recommendations for SMEs & Start-Up’s**


**Start-Up’s / Scale-Up’s > Innovation to Market**
The semiconductor ecosystem in Europe faces the challenge of translating cutting-edge research into successful and sustainable business models. The fabless model has emerged as
a crucial driver of national and regional competitiveness and requires targeted support
through business scaling policies.

From an Austrian perspective, the Chips Act 2.0 presents an opportunity to foster technological entrepreneurship, support startups and SMEs, and accelerate the transition from innovation to market-ready solutions. Austria’s growing network of design and technology service
companies has the potential to compete internationally if provided with access to advanced
design tools, patient capital, and structured growth support. Strengthening this segment is

vital for reducing external dependencies, enhancing domestic value creation, and ensuring
Austria’s contribution to European technological sovereignty.

**Recommendations:**

  - Incentives for **tech-incubators and accelerators** to catalyze innovation, reduce bar
riers for start-ups, build local expertise, attract investment, and ultimately make the

domestic semiconductor industry more competitive and resilient.


  - **Boosting national Accelerator Programs (** high-tech-support) for semiconductor

scale-up companies by serving them as Accelerator & Incubator & Venture Fund &

University Ecosystem & Silicon Europe access. Strucutred programs and access to ad
visory pool from research and industry for rapid growth.


  - Reduce design & prototype costs by offering **open-source PDKs** (Process Design Kits),

develop government- or university-subsidized EDA tool accessand afacilitating access

to open EDA tools and shared tape- out services .


  - Improve time-to-Market by providing **pre-verified platform SoCs for SMEs**, provide

access to test and validation infrastructure.


  - Offer **public-private co-funding programs** to reduce tape-out risk for early-stage

companies, incentivate the development of revenue-sharing fabrication models, cre
ation of semiconductor specific venture debt aligned to the long development cycles

of hardware


  - Foster Open-Source Silicon and **expand the RISC-V ecosystem** . Grow open source

toolchains and support open source analog IP efforts.


**Talent, training and microcredentials**
It would be necessary to merge the various European and national education initiatives in
the semiconductor sector into a **pan-European program comparable to “KIC Chips”** . Below you will find a description of the most important Austrian contributions to these projects.

GreenChips-EDU is a European education initiative (2023–2027) designed to build a comprehensive talent pipeline for sustainable, energy-efficient microelectronics in support of the EU
Chips Act. It develops new bachelor’s and master’s curricula, micro-credentials, and professional training programs, and integrates mobility, internships, and industry-embedded project work to address Europe’s semiconductor skills shortage. The consortium includes seven
European universities—among them TU Graz—and eight industry and research partners collaborating to train roughly 600 students and upskill professionals in “green” chip technologies.


Silicon Alps Cluster GmbH

Unite! is a European alliance of nine leading science- and technology-focused universities
that jointly build a transnational “inter-university campus” to enable shared education, research, and innovation. The alliance develops joint curricula, flexible learning paths, virtual
and physical mobility opportunities, and collaborative initiatives in fields such as sustainable
energy, AI, digitalization, and entrepreneurship. Its members include TU Graz, Aalto University, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, TU Darmstadt, Grenoble INP – UGA, Politecnico di
Torino, Universidade de Lisboa, UPC BarcelonaTech, and Wroclaw University of Science and
Technology.

The TRANSFORM initiative—launched in April 2024 by the Silicon Alps Cluster together with
TU Graz Life - Long Learning and partner technical universities (e.g. FH JOANNEUM) — aims
to strengthen the Southern Austrian electronics and microelectronics industry (Electronic
Based Systems, EBS) by building advanced competences in areas like “Power Cyber Physical
Systems”, digitalization, cybersecurity, smart sensors and embedded systems.

**Recommendations:**

  - Merging GreenChips EDU and other Programs into a **pan European Knowledge and**

**Innovation Community KIC Chips** .


  - Using the **microcredentials framework** that recognizes skills in microelectronics and

design, promoting labour mobility and transnational cooperation **for Life Long**

**Learning Programmes** to ensure transparent values of teriary education in semicon
ductors.


**State aid and regulatory framework**
State aid and regulatory frameworks in the semiconductor industry are clearly aimed at supporting innovation, supply-chain resilience, and regional technological sovereignty. SMEs
and start-ups are key drivers of innovation. However, they often struggle to access funding
programmes because the application processes are complex, there are high matching-fund
requirements, strict compliance obligations and limited eligibility for advanced-node facilities. Large corporations benefit from scale and dedicated resources. Smaller companies do
not. They face **disproportionate administrative burdens** and long approval timelines.
These impede their ability to compete globally and bring new technologies to market. A more
SME-oriented policy design is essential to unlock their full contribution to the semiconductor
ecosystem.

**Recommendations:**

  - Create fast-track application paths for SMEs with simplified documentation


Silicon Alps Cluster GmbH
Europastrasse 12
A-9524 Villach page **4** of **8**


  - Provide cascade funding programs (lump-sum) for feasibility studies, prototyping and

MPW shuttel


  - Create a specific regulatory framework for the semiconductor sector, with differenti
ated rules compared to other industrial sectors that favor investment and R&D.


  - Support regional semiconductor design hubs linked to universities and research cen
ters


  - Provide clear, long-term guidance on state-aid rules and semiconductor funding cy
cles.


  - Allow direct aid to design centers, equipment suppliers and laboratories.


  - Establish regulatory sandboxes for emerging semiconductor technologies.


**European Competitiveness Fund (ECF) and private capital**
The European Competitiveness Fund (ECF), in conjunction with private capital, aims to
strengthen Europe's strategic autonomy and technological competitiveness. However, semiconductor SMEs and start-ups still face significant funding barriers. Deep-tech hardware
ventures require substantial, long-term investment, while private investors often prefer software models with faster returns, creating a persistent financing gap. **Access to ECF instru-**
**ments** remains challenging due to the **complexity of eligibility rules**, the length of
disbursement timelines, and the stringent due-diligence requirements. These factors create
significant disadvantages for young companies. Consequently, many semiconductor startups encounter difficulties in securing adequate early-stage capital, particularly in the "valley
of death" between prototyping and first industrial deployment. In order to unlock the full
potential of Europe's semiconductor innovation engine, it is necessary to implement more
flexible, SME-oriented financial mechanisms and stronger incentives for private investors.

**Recommendations:**


  - Introduce automatic double-equity matching, where every euro of private investment

in semiconductor SMEs is matched by ECF or national funds.


  - Prioritize early-stage and first industrialization rounds to bridge the capital gap for

tape-outs, packaging, and verification.


  - Implement milestone-based co-investment to reduce risk for private investors while

maintaining accountability for start-ups.


  - Allow convertible instruments or revenue-sharing structures to accommodate diverse

business models in the semiconductor sector.

  - Provide tax credits or deductions for private investors who fund semiconductor start
ups.


  - Offer R&D tax super-deductions tailored to capital-intensive hardware development

(design, MPW runs, testing, and EDA tooling).


  - Implement capital gains tax reductions for long-term investments in deep-tech hard
ware ventures.


  - Incentive like reductions of payroll tax for semiconductor start-ups hiring specialized

engineering talent to scale faster.


**Industry associations, governance and coordination**
To ensure the success of the Chips Act 2.0 regional associations, **clusters and networks**
**should be incorporated within the decision making process** and not just for consultation.
Structured coordination between different levels of governance are necessary to have a
common understanding about Chips Act 2.0 on all levels of governance.
Silicon Alps Cluster, as a member of the **Silicon Europe Alliance (SEA)**, fully supports the
recommendation letter provided by the Alliance.

**Recommendations:**

  - Integrate industry associations into the Chips Joint Undertaking (Chips JU) and the Eu
ropean **Semiconductor Regions Alliance (ESRA)** .


  - Consult call for **Silicon Europe Alliance (SEA)** as a European Committee of Semicon
ductor Clusters to channel joint positions to the EU Commission.


**Demand incentives and driving sectors within Europe**
Chips Act 2.0 should extend beyond supply-side initiatives and act as a catalyst for wider
economic transformation across Europe. Promoting the adoption of European-produced
chips in strategic industrial sectors can enhance technological independence, reduce reliance on external sources, and support sustainable economies of scale. Industries such as
automotive, energy, defense, telecommunications, and healthcare are well-positioned to
serve as key drivers of innovation, stimulating demand and reinforcing the domestic market.
It is essential that policy measures are designed to encourage forward-looking public procurement and facilitate strategic partnerships between manufacturers and end users

**Recommendations:**

  - **Create incentive programs for the adoption of European chips** in automotive, en
ergy, defense, healthcare and industry 4.0.


  - **co-development programs** between chip suppliers and industrial users.

Europastrasse 12
A-9524 Villach page **6** of **8**


  - **Public procurement strategies** focusing on Made in Europe


**Strategic challenges and opportunities**
The current geopolitical context and global competition in cutting-edge technologies demand a more ambitious and cohesive European strategy. The Chips Act 2.0 must focus on
those areas where Europe can differentiate itself, maximizing its industrial and technological
impact.
Integrated photonics, AI hardware, advanced materials, and energy efficiency are fields
where **Austria** already excels and can contribute significantly to European leadership. This
section identifies priority opportunities to transform public investment into an engine of
strategic autonomy.

**Recommendations:**

  - Promote **integrated photonics** and **edge AI** as areas of strategic specialization.


  - Strengthening the role of **RISC-V, open design, and sustainable AI hardware** .


  - Support the development of critical materials and **processing equipment** to reduce

dependencies.


  - Consolidate **international cooperation** with partners such as Japan, South Korea and

the USA in advanced R&D.


  - **Packaging and IC substrates**


  - **Passive components**


**Lower entry barriers for market entry to EU market**


  - European semiconductor manufacturers face significant regulatory hurdles that slow

down the expansion of production capacity. Complex and lengthy permitting pro
cesses for building new fabs, stringent environmental requirements, and differing na
tional standards across EU member states create delays and increase costs. These

fragmented bureaucratic obstacles make it challenging for companies to scale opera
tions quickly, hindering Europe’s competitiveness in the global semiconductor market.

Chips Act I itself does not override all technical standards or national laws — according

to the official explanatory memorandum, it does not automatically lead to harmoni
zation of national laws and regulations. Many technical standards, environmental and

safety regulations, production standards, etc. continue to be regulated at the national


Silicon Alps Cluster GmbH
Europastrasse 12
A-9524 Villach page **7** of **8**


level or by standardization organizations (e.g. standardization associations, industrial

consortia) — where progress may vary from country to country.


**Recommendations:**


  - Standardization work (e.g., within the CRA) is currently (2024/2025) still in the devel
opment stage — this process should be accelerated to eliminated the barriers.

## **Conclusions**

The recommendations outlined in this document highlight the critical role of SMEs and startups in strengthening Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem, with Austria’s Silicon Alps Cluster
serving as a key example of regional excellence and innovation. By addressing funding gaps,
regulatory barriers, skills shortages, and market access challenges, Chips Act 2.0 can provide
a comprehensive framework to accelerate innovation, enhance technological sovereignty,
and stimulate demand for European chips across strategic industries. Targeted measures—
ranging from support for fabless start-ups and open-source design initiatives to tax incentives, demand-driven programs, and coordinated governance—are essential to unlock the
full potential of Europe’s semiconductor sector. A coherent, SME-focused approach will not
only foster competitiveness and resilience but also transform regional capabilities into globally relevant industrial leadership.
