**Policy background**
The **EU Chips Act (2023)** laid an important foundation for Europe’s semiconductor ambitions,
mobilizing public and private investments to enhance capacity, R&D, and resilience.
However, rapid technological evolution, geopolitical developments, and increasing industrial
interdependence require a more integrated and forward-looking approach. Clear focus should be on
industrial deployment when revising the research dimension of the EU Chips Act. Today’s research
should be aimed at winning tomorrow’s markets.

The next phase — **EU Chips Act 2.0** - should focus on connecting innovation to industrialization,
ensuring financing continuity, and extending strategic attention on conditions to innovate across all
segments of the supply and value chains and strengthen the industrial innovation infrastructure.
Europe should focus on areas of European strength and identify areas of critical and strategic
technologies where Europe has the capacity to lead.

Svensk Elektronik, in partnership with the Swedish Government, relevant ministries, national and EU
counterparts, contributes actively to shaping this future through industrial coordination and policy
dialogue.

**The Electronics and Semiconductor Industry in Sweden**
Sweden hosts a highly advanced, diversified, and export-oriented electronics industry that plays a
critical role in Europe’s technological landscape. The sector comprises 8,000 companies and 260,000
employees, ranging from global industrial leaders to specialized SMEs, with strengths in
telecommunications, automotive systems, defense electronics, energy technologies, industrial
automation, and medical technology.

At the heart of this ecosystem lies a growing semiconductor and microelectronics community,
covering design, power electronics, embedded systems (incl autonomous driving), photonics, and
manufacturing equipment.

Sweden’s capabilities extend throughout the electronics value chain — including design, testing,
manufacturing and system integration — forming a strong foundation for innovation and resilience in
European supply chains.

**Key national strengths include:**

Sweden’s vision is to serve as a strategic innovation hub within the European semiconductor value
chain, combining technological excellence, sustainability, and industrial competitiveness.

**Key Industry Recommendations for the EU Chips Act 2.0**


**1. Alignment with Industrial and End-Market Needs**
For Chips Act 2.0 to achieve real impact and strengthen Europe’s position in the global value chain, it
must be firmly anchored in the operational realities of Europe’s industries and end-markets. Europe
should leverage its strengths and align with market trends and demands. Semiconductor policy
should not be developed in isolation but integrated with industrial strategies for key sectors such as
automotive, energy, defense, telecommunications, medical technology, and industrial automation.
European competitiveness relies on access to technologies that are both cutting-edge and industrially
deployable. Therefore, funding priorities should reflect real market demand, ensuring that research
and innovation lead to tangible, scalable, and economically viable manufacturing outcomes.

Member States founded the “Semicon Coalition”, seeking strong cooperation and fast-track action
from the European Commission to address the semiconductor industry as a strategic asset and
necessity for Europe’s competitiveness, resilience and strategic autonomy.


**2. Strengthening Europe’s Role in Global Value Chains**
Semiconductors are at the core of an interconnected global ecosystem. Europe’s strategic goal
should be **to strengthen its position within global value chains**, not to isolate itself from them.
This means fostering global partnerships while reinforcing Europe’s role in advanced design,
materials innovation, specialized manufacturing, and high-reliability systems. Europe’s comparative
advantage lies in high-value segments — such as power electronics, advanced sensors, and system
integration — which should be further leveraged through coordinated industrial and trade policies.

The Chips Act 2.0 should therefore support **open and secure value-chain participation**, ensuring
that European actors remain indispensable partners in the global semiconductor landscape, while
safeguarding supply security and critical technologies through strategic autonomy measures.


**3. Integrating Research and Development with Industrialization**
Europe’s research base is world-class, but too often innovation stops at the laboratory stage. To
regain global competitiveness, Europe must close the gap between research excellence and industrial
execution.

Chips Act 2.0 should therefore prioritize **programs that directly link R&D activities to industrial**
**outcomes** and expand support for:

  - **Pilot lines and demonstration facilities** that enable the validation of new technologies in
real production environments

  - **Public–private partnerships** that bring together research institutions, large companies, and
SMEs

  - **Cross-border technology testbeds** to accelerate technology transfer across Europe

By aligning innovation policy with manufacturing policy, Europe can shorten the time from concept to
commercial product, ensuring that new technologies are produced in Europe rather than transferred
abroad.


**4. Improved Financing Tools and a Dedicated Semiconductor Budget**
Access to financing remains one of the most significant barriers to innovation and industrial growth.
Semiconductor investments are capital-intensive, risky, and long-term in nature — conditions that
often exceed the scope of existing EU and national funding programs.

Chips Act 2.0 should introduce a **dedicated semiconductor financing framework**, including:

  - A **semiconductor-specific EU budget line**, ensuring sustained and predictable support for
strategic projects

  - Simplified application and approval procedures, particularly for SMEs

  - Coordinated national co-financing mechanisms to maximize leverage of public and private
investment
Such mechanisms should also encourage cross-border collaboration and the establishment of **IPCEI-**
**like initiatives** that span the entire value chain. A more coherent financial architecture will strengthen
Europe’s ability to attract and retain advanced semiconductor investment.


**5. Develop a Strategy for Strategic Electronics Manufacturing in Europe**
Europe needs to increase the pace of the **innovation cycle** - connecting research, design,
prototyping, volume manufacturing, and system integration. Semiconductor manufacturing must be
recognized not only as an industrial activity but as a **strategic capability** essential for Europe’s
competitiveness, resilience, and sovereignty.

To stay competitive Europe needs also **volume product manufacturing in the region** . Without
commercially viable production of high-volume products, European industry cannot achieve the
economies of scale required to be **price-competitive** in global markets.
Today, much of Europe’s semiconductor and electronics production depends on manufacturing in
Asia, where large-scale ecosystems create cost advantages through concentration of suppliers,
workforce, and logistics. This model undermines Europe’s competitivenss in several ways:

  - **Fragmented supply chains** reduce flexibility and innovation speed.

  - **Loss of know-how and industrial learning** occur when manufacturing is located outside
Europe.

  - **Strategic dependency** on non-European regions poses risks to both industry and security.

  - **Distance from end markets** increases lead times and logistics.

For Europe to remain competitive, **volume products are needed to build around** - products that
justify investment in manufacturing capacity, supply-chain infrastructure, and skills.

Chips Act 2.0 should therefore:

  - Secure **manufacturing** within Europe, especially in sectors of strategic importance.

  - Stimulate **industrial clustering** that co-locates R&D, pilot lines, and volume manufacturing to
strengthen innovation loops.

  - Encourage **strategic partnerships** to ensure sustained production volumes.

  - Promote **regional hubs** that can scale innovation to industrial mass production.

Only by anchoring strategic manufacturing in Europe can the continent achieve sustainable
competitiveness, retain technological sovereignty, and secure its position in the global electronics
industry.


**6. Building Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain**

The pandemic and recent geopolitical tensions have highlighted Europe’s dependence on external
semiconductor supply. A resilient ecosystem must be capable of absorbing shocks without
jeopardizing critical industries.

Chips Act 2.0 should therefore include:

  - Support for diversification of supply sources and regional manufacturing

  - Crisis coordination mechanisms among Member States and key industries


**7. Bridging the Scale-Up Gap**
While Europe produces world-leading semiconductor start-ups, too few of them reach global scale.
The transition from R&D to industrialization and volume manufacturing remains a structural weakness
in the European innovation system.

Chips Act 2.0 should therefore establish a Scale-Up Acceleration Framework, providing:

  - Access to pilot and shared production facilities

  - Tailored financing instruments for industrial scaling

  - Mentorship and partnership programs linking start-ups with established manufacturers

Bridging the scale-up gap will ensure that promising innovations stay in Europe, creating jobs,
strengthening regional clusters, and building the next generation of European semiconductor leaders.


**8. Focus on Europe’s strengths and opportunities in AI**
Europe should build on its industrial strengths and innovation capacity to take a leading role in the
next generation of AI semiconductors. The growing importance of AI makes it essential that Europe
develops and produces the chips that power this transformation.

We recommend an approach supporting both foundational AI chips and European leading-edge AI
chips.

_Foundational Chips for AI (Edge and Physical AI)_
Europe should ensure a leadership position in the next wave of AI innovation. Edge AI allows for realtime data processing, analysis, and decision making directly on smart connected devices when
challenges such as latency and data security increase. Leadership in Edge AI is necessary for
winning the next global technology race in intelligent systems and robotics, and Europe already has a
pole position in necessary key components such as microcontrollers and smart sensors. The
approach should also include powering AI, addressing the growing electricity demand and need for
energy efficiencies to reduce the overall power consumption of AI server systems and data centers.
To promote foundational chips for AI in Europe, the EU Chips Act 2.0 should contain dedicated
instruments enabling the semiconductor ecosystem in Europe to become global leaders.

_European Leading-Edge Chips for AI_
An approach to drive European leading-edge chips for AI should be developed to ensure Europe’s
leadership position in research, manufacturing processes, and semiconductor manufacturing
equipment. It should also identify and address technology gaps and include a concept to increase
Europe’s tech sovereignty, in close alignment with the industry.

In addition, Chips Act 2.0 should prepare Europe for disruptive AI technologies — including quantum
computing — and promote strategic international partnerships to access complementary know-how
where needed.


**9. Enabling Innovation Across the Entire Value Chain - and Focusing on Resilience**
The success of Europe’s semiconductor strategy depends on the strength and interconnection of its
full electronics ecosystem. Chips alone do not create value; it is through integration that they enable
competitive and innovative end products.

**Advanced packaging** and **chiplet technologies** represent a shift in semiconductor manufacturing.
Instead of relying solely on ever-smaller transistor nodes, they enable multiple chips or functional
blocks (“chiplets”) — often produced in different process technologies or by different suppliers — to
be combined within a single package. This approach delivers higher performance, lower power
consumption, and faster time-to-market while reducing dependence on single-node manufacturing
capacity.

These technologies are becoming the backbone of next-generation computing, AI accelerators,
automotive systems, and edge devices.

**Chips Act 2.0** should recognize the critical role of **advanced packaging**, **chiplet integration**,
**printed circuit boards (PCB)**, and **electronic manufacturing services (EMS/PCBA)** within the

semiconductor value chain. These sectors form the essential bridge between semiconductor design
and system-level innovation.

Together, they:

  - Anchor semiconductor capabilities in Europe’s industrial base by linking design,
manufacturing, and application

  - Enable heterogeneous integration and rapid prototyping for high-value, low-volume
production

  - Shorten innovation cycles by connecting chip design with system-level testing and
deployment

  - Strengthen resilience by retaining key assembly, packaging, and manufacturing capabilities in
Europe

  - Ensure that Europe can compete not only in chip design and manufacturing, but also in the
advanced integration technologies shaping the future of electronics

By embedding **sustainability and full value-chain integration** into Chips Act 2.0, Europe can not
only enhance competitiveness and resilience but also demonstrate **global leadership in**
**responsible, high-value manufacturing** .

**Conclusion**
The **EU Chips Act 2.0** should serve as a catalyst for an integrated, resilient, and competitive
European semiconductor ecosystem. By linking research, industrialization, and full value-chain
participation, Europe can ensure its long-term technological leadership and economic security.

Svensk Elektronik/Semicon Sweden remain committed to active collaboration with the European
Commission, Member States, and industry partners to advance this shared vision.
