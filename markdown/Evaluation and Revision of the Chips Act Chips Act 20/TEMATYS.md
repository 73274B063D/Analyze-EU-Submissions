feedback: 'It is said in the call for evidence document, the demand for 10nm or less
  nodes chips is limited. On the contrary, there is a great need for facilities that
  could manufacture small and medium size series at competitive cost. By "manufacture",
  I mean all the value chain, from lithography to packaging and metrology. By "chips",
  I mean microelectronics but also all the diversity of microphotonics i.e. PICs,
  copackaged optics, metasurfaces, material processing, waveguides etc. Photonic microdevices
  are much more diverse than microelectronic chips. By "small and medium size series",
  I mean all those chips needed in applications like medical, industry, industrial
  gas sensing, etc. where the series are from few hundreds to some hundred thousand
  but less than millions. These application markets are where Europe is still competitive.
  There is a great need for 1. research 2. pilot lines 3. start-ups and companies
  active in fabrication, automation, metrology, digital twin etc. aiming to develop
  those versatile manufacturing technologies than lower dramatically the cost of small
  and medium size series. And there is of course a great need of companies to run
  those versatile plants and facilities. But in order to do it, there is a lack of
  people experienced in running such facilities: engineers, technicians, operators.
  These people exist and work in big plants of Malaysia etc. I receive a lot of candidacies
  of people having such experience and wishing to come in Europe. A specific program
  to facilitate their venue would be very efficient along with a training program
  that could ask them to share their knowledge to European young engineers. Another
  great concern for me is the ownership of companies. A study we made in 2022 showed
  that 14% of the PIC companies were owned by non-European investors. 14% is not that
  big but is terms of revenue it represented 27% total revenue in the Netherlands,
  43% in Germany and 15% in France. We need to mobilize private investors and show
  them that this industry is growing and will grow for long.'
