# **Recommendations for the Chips Act Upgrade 2026**


TLT PCB appreciates the chance to engage with the European Commission's Public Consultation
and Call for Evidence on the upcoming Chips Act review (Chips Act 2). The revision of the EU
Chips Act represents a strategic opportunity for the European Commission and Member States to
reinforce and optimise semiconductor supply chains at both European and global levels.


TLT PCB in Vilnius, Lithuania – the first PCB factory in the history of Lithuania, and currently the
most modern PCB factory in Europe, featuring top-level automation, digitalisation, and sustainability
solutions. Over the past 20 years, no new PCB factory has been built in Europe.


**This document presents TLT PCB’s recommendations for the upcoming 2026 European**
**Chips Act revision.** It reflects the company’s practical insights from building Europe’s most
advanced greenfield PCB factory and outlines key policy actions needed to strengthen Europe’s
electronics sovereignty. The recommendations emphasise that Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) together with critical raw materials such as copper and laminates - must be recognised as strategic
pillars of the European semiconductor and electronics ecosystem.

## **1. Include PCBs in the Chips Act Ecosystem**


The Chips Act currently focuses on semiconductors, yet chips cannot function without PCBs. It is
essential to explicitly recognise PCB manufacturing, design and supply chains as a strategic layer
within the Chips Act ecosystem. The Act should establish a European PCB Competence Centre,
mirroring existing semiconductor competence centres.

## **2. Targeted Financial Support for PCB and Raw Material Manufacturing**


A dedicated 'PCB and Materials Facility Support Scheme' should be created to promote the
establishment and modernisation of PCB and copper laminate manufacturing in the EU. The scheme
should provide grants, soft loans, or tax incentives for:

- Acquisition of production equipment and infrastructure

- Automation, digitalisation, and sustainability projects

- Development of local copper and laminate supply chains to reduce dependence on Asia.


## **3. Strategic Public Procurement and Security**

To strengthen the EU’s security of supply and reduce strategic dependencies – particularly on Asian
manufacturing – the EU should consider adapting its public procurement framework so that public
purchasers in the sectors of defence, aviation, healthcare, energy, and communication prioritise
semiconductors, PCBs, laminates, and related components manufactured within the EU, NATO or in
trusted partner jurisdictions. Quality, resilience, and security of supply should take precedence over
lowest-cost criteria. Such an approach would reinforce Europe’s industrial base, enhance supply-chain
security, and support the objectives of the revised Chips Act.

## **4. Streamlined Certification and Market Access**


Establish an EU-wide certification program for PCB and electronic component manufacturing to
accelerate qualification for defence and industrial supply chains. Financial support should be available
for companies obtaining UL, ISO, and other defence-grade certifications, as well as for establishing
testing and validation laboratories in Europe.

## **5. Security and Intellectual Property Protection**


Introduce an 'EU Trusted PCB Standard' requiring full traceability from design to production and
guaranteeing that critical electronics are manufactured within EU or NATO jurisdictions. This would
significantly reduce IP leakage and the risk of hardware-based cyber threats ('Trojan horses').

## **6. Strategic Resilience and Capacity Reservation**


Integrate PCB and copper laminate manufacturing into the 'European Electronics Resilience
Reserve'. Introduce a capacity reservation mechanism for critical sectors such as defence and
industrial automation. European-based production ensures delivery of critical components within
days instead of months from Asia.

## **7. Skills, Awareness, and Competence Development**


Support cooperation between industry and education to strengthen PCB and materials expertise.
Integrate PCB-related modules into the 'Chips Academy' and fund training, internships, and research
in advanced electronics materials.

## **Expected Impact**


- Reduced dependency on Asia

- Enhanced European technological sovereignty and defence autonomy

- Revitalisation of PCB and copper laminate manufacturing in Europe

- Improved IP and cybersecurity protection

- Creation of high-skilled jobs and regional innovation centres
