feedback: 'Less focus on the % of manufacturing in Europe and more on ''Control Point'':
  products by European companies based on European technology (and infrastructure
  and ecosystem of suppliers, etc.) that are indispensable in international value
  chains. We have two kinds of this: First, existing strengths, which can be in chip
  manufacturing but equally well in equipment (ASML) or materials (Soitec). Make sure
  these are strengthened, supported, and will stay European. Secondly, focus on topics
  where we can built such new strengths. Which again can be in equipment (Nearfield
  Instruments), chips (new AI chips?), quantum technologies, or manufacturing (Infineon,
  NXP,...). This doesn''t necessarily makes the European portfolio a complete value
  chain, but will give more power in intercontinental geo-economics. More focus on
  what makes Europe unique as well: RTO''s. RTO''s play a key role in supporting our
  control points (TNO for ASML, CEA for STM, FhG for Infineon, etc.), while also pushing
  and nudging existing industry towards sustainability and continued innovation. RTO''s
  are also essential to develop new control points: their spin-offs have (although
  lower in number) often higher impact and chance of unicorn status than spin-offs
  from universities, and in this way we work on ''constructive destruction'' (before
  USA based companies attack European control points). This requires some investments,
  though, as RTO''s have to have some power to work on innovations where existing
  control point might not be too supportive on. The JU model with the funding coming
  50/50% from Europe and member states makes the system vulnerable to misalignment;
  perhaps Europe could take a more powerful position here. Although not a specialist
  in chip design, I believe it is worth investing in. It is often the start of new
  value chains or powerful positions. It creates to ''pull'' for manufacturing sites,
  too. Equally important: anything that helps to come to one single European internal
  market (regulation, financing, etc.) which allows European companies to sell their
  products to all of Europe!'
