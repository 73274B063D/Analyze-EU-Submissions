  the scope of the Act: the exclusion of the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing
  sector from its core strategic definitions and support mechanisms. A Technical and
  Legal Gap in Scope The current framework of the European Chips Act primarily channels
  support through measures defined under Pillar 2, focusing on the establishment of
  ''First-of-a-Kind'' and ''Integrated Production Facilities (IPFs)'' or ''Open EU
  Foundries (OEFs)''. This core legislative focus defines the scope of strategic support
  and priority too narrowly. Narrow Definition of ''Integration'': By concentrating
  investment and regulatory efforts almost exclusively on semiconductor fabrication
  (wafer level) and advanced packaging technologies, the Act fails to account for
  the crucial interconnection layer necessary to make any chip functional. The PCB
  is the indispensable physical and electrical foundation that enables the integration
  of chips into any final electronic system. Exclusion of Critical Enablers: The PCB
  manufacturing sector, which provides the critical substrate and interconnection
  technology for all IPFs and OEFs to be practically operationalized, is effectively
  excluded from these strategic definitions. This creates a literal supply chain gap:
  we may secure the silicon chip, but if the substrate (the PCB) must still be sourced
  from vulnerable non-EU supply chains, the goal of true end-to-end resilience is
  not met. The Threat to Supply Chain Security Ignoring the PCB sector introduces
  a significant vulnerability that fundamentally undermines the Acts primary objective:
  Incomplete Resilience: The PCB becomes the unprotected critical bottleneck. Achieving
  high volumes of European-made chips provides no strategic advantage if their deployment
  is limited by the availability, quality, and security of corresponding European-made
  advanced PCB substrates (such as High-Density Interconnect - HDI, and complex multilayer
  boards). Technological Alignment: Investment in cutting-edge semiconductor nodes
  requires parallel investment in advanced PCB manufacturing to handle the high density
  and signal integrity requirements. A gap in the European PCB sector will directly
  inhibit the effective uptake and integration of the very advanced chips the Act
  aims to promote. Concrete Recommendation TS PCB urges the European Commission and
  the co-legislators to formally expand the definitions and scope of support under
  the European Chips Act 2 to explicitly include the Advanced Printed Circuit Board
  manufacturing industry. This expansion must ensure that: PCB manufacturing facilities
  producing advanced substrates are recognized as strategic, ''first-of-a-kind'' enablers
  of the European electronics ecosystem. Funding and regulatory mechanisms are available
  to stimulate R&D and significant capacity expansion in complex, high-reliability
  PCB technologies within the EU. A secure European semiconductor supply chain is
  impossible without a secure, advanced European PCB supply chain. We appeal to the
  European Commission to close this critical technical and legislative gap.'
