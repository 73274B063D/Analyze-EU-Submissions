feedback: 'Europes competitiveness and technological resilience depend on keeping
  pace with the fast-evolving semiconductor landscape. Technology Industries of Finland
  urges the EU to act with urgency in its chips policy so that implementation matches
  global developments and delivers a systemic, forward-looking strategy that consolidates
  strengths, tackles dependencies, reflects and catalyses demand and aligns EU and
  national action. Our key asks are: 1) Excellence-based funding and market demand
  Create a dedicated semiconductor budget of critical mass under the next MFF within
  the European Competitiveness Fund and align it with national and private funding.
  Prioritise high-growth and strategic areas such as chip design (e.g. Edge AI and
  6G chips based on EUV technology), MEMS/sensors, photonics, quantum chips, advanced
  materials and process innovations (e.g. atomic layer deposition). Funding must follow
  excellence and global leadership potential. Expand First-of-a-Kind facilities to
  upstream chemicals and materials and to downstream assembly, testing and packaging,
  and include quantum chip fabrication. Design Centres of Excellence should have a
  clear definition and a broadened scope that includes startups, SMEs and large companies
  working on state-of-the-art chip design, architecture and Electronic Design Automation
  tools. Catalyse industry-led alliances that connect chip providers with end users
  to secure early adoption and anchor demand in sectors such as automotive, telecoms

**Recommendations for an EU Chips Act 2.0: A stronger strategy for**
**Europe’s technological competitiveness and resilience**


Europe’s competitiveness and economic security hinge on keeping pace with the fast-evolving
semiconductor landscape. Chips are the foundation for connectivity, defence, AI, clean energy,
robotics and mobility. Europe holds world-class expertise in several parts of the global
semiconductor value chain, yet its overall position remains fragile, exposing it to geopolitical
risks, economic coercion, trade conflicts and supply shocks. The first Chips Act created
momentum, but Europe now needs a stronger and more coordinated effort to meet its ambitions.
As the semiconductor space accelerates globally, EU chips policy should respond with urgency
and determination, ensuring that implementation is not only ambitious but also rapid enough to
match international developments.

A _Chips Act 2.0_ must therefore provide a systemic and forward-looking strategy: consolidating
Europe’s competitive advantages, tackling dependencies, generating demand for manufacturing
capacity and ensuring that policies at national and EU levels work in synergy. This means setting
realistic yet ambitious targets, leveraging investment, enabling collaborative R&D, addressing
workforce shortages and embedding sustainability at the core of Europe’s semiconductor
ecosystem. Furthermore, it must establish robust platforms for closer cooperation with likeminded partners, aimed at ensuring resilient and interconnected semiconductor supply chains and
innovation ecosystems.

Through its national strategy, _[Chips from the North](https://teknologiateollisuus.fi/en/finland-targets-export-surge-in-semiconductors-aims-to-elevate-europes-technological-competitiveness/)_, Finland brings to the table strengths such as
chip design, advanced pilot lines, and specialised materials and process technologies —
reinforcing the EU’s collective capacity in a critical technology domain.


**1** **Secure excellence-based funding and market demand for high-growth chip**
**technologies**


- **Centralised semiconductor budget with targeted support for strategic technologies** :
The EU should create a semiconductor budget of critical mass under the next Multiannual
Financial Framework (MFF), specifically within the European Competitiveness Fund (ECF). This
budget should be aligned with national and private funding streams to maximise scale,
coherence and impact. Funding should prioritise high-growth and strategic areas such as chip
design (e.g. Edge AI and 6G chips based on EUV technology), MEMS/sensors, photonics,
quantum chips, advanced materials and process innovations (e.g. atomic layer deposition).
Europe should not limit its ambition to catching up in semiconductor manufacturing. It should
also focus on defining and building strategic niches where it holds and can achieve global
relevance and sustained market leadership – whether through specialised technologies, critical
applications or unique strengths across the value chain.


- **Excellence first:** Funding should be allocated based on demonstrated excellence and
potential for global leadership, ensuring that only the most promising projects receive
support.


- **Broader scope for FOAK and DSE:** The scope of First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) facilities should be
expanded to include critical upstream actors such as chemicals and materials providers, as
well as downstream actors such as assembly, testing and packaging providers. It should also
cover quantum chip fabrication. At the same time, Design Centres of Excellence (DSE) should
have a clear definition and broadened scope to include startups, SMEs and large companies

working on state-of-the-art chip design, architecture and Electronic Design Automation (EDA)
tools.

- **Demand creation through industry-led alliances:** Europe should catalyse and support
industry-led alliances, ecosystems and consortia that connect chip providers with end-users,
ensuring early adoption of innovative chips designed and made in Europe. Such initiatives
would help secure anchor customers, strengthen downstream competitiveness in sectors like
automotive, telecoms and energy and reinforce Europe’s global market position.


- **Next-generation IPCEI for advanced semiconductors** : The forthcoming IPCEI on
Advanced Semiconductor Technologies (AST) should place strong emphasis on reinforcing
Europe’s microelectronics design capabilities, which are essential for next-generation
connectivity. Europe’s global leadership in mobile networks and optical backbones can only be
sustained through continued and targeted support for design excellence under IPCEI AST. The
new initiative should also streamline procedures, minimise administrative burdens and
prioritise edge AI and cutting-edge chip design. It must ensure a level playing field for
European semiconductor and connectivity champions, as well as emerging innovators, in the
face of extensive state support in Asia and North America. Funds should be deployed to
enhance the global competitiveness of EU companies, with flexibility to support individual
company initiatives.


**2** **Foster cross-border, company-led R&D and chip innovation hubs with continued pilot**
**line support**


- **Company-led innovation through EU Tech Frontrunners** : Establish a dedicated scheme
for the semiconductor sector under the EU Tech Frontrunners model found in the European
Competitiveness Fund (ECF). This instrument would channel EU R&D funding directly to lead
companies that drive ambitious, high-impact innovation agendas together with their
ecosystems of SMEs, startups, research institutions and suppliers. By empowering lead firms
to coordinate large-scale, mission-driven R&D and deployment projects, this approach would
accelerate breakthroughs in areas such as chip design, advanced materials and sustainable
manufacturing, while ensuring that value creation and industrial capacity remain anchored in
Europe.

- **Chip innovation hubs** : The EU should establish chip innovation hubs as centres of excellence
for semiconductor research, development and commercialisation, supporting cross-border
R&D collaboration. These hubs, supported by Chips Competence Centres, should incorporate
industry clusters, pilot lines and the EU design platform to enable swift prototyping and
testing of new semiconductor technologies. To support the development of the hubs, an
international benchmarking analysis should be performed, drawing on the best available
models and practices.

- **R&D funding for future breakthroughs** : The upcoming EU R&D framework programme
(FP10) needs to swiftly ensure strong funding for the chip sector. By continuing to fund pilot
lines, the design platform and ambitious R&D projects within the innovation hubs, the EU can
ensure that breakthroughs in innovative semiconductor technologies are efficiently
transitioned from research to manufacturing and deployment in digital infrastructure. Building
on this approach, Finland’s VTT should serve as the host for a 300mm line dedicated to
specialised microelectronics for dual-use applications. This initiative would focus on the key
technological strongholds identified: superconducting quantum technologies, advanced
computing solutions such as analogue, quantum and photonic computing, as well as
connectivity.

- **Sustained leadership in quantum chip technologies:** To maintain Europe’s
competitiveness in quantum chip technologies, the Commission should build on the quantum
pilot lines already launched through Chips JU calls and ensure their development well beyond
initial funding. This requires long-term support, integration with innovation hubs and proactive
planning for the next wave of disruptive quantum technologies, securing Europe’s future
leadership in this strategic domain.


**3** **Address critical workforce shortages with relevant programmes and mobility**
**initiatives**


- **Robust skills pipeline** : To meet the growing demand for talent, the EU should prioritise
education and workforce development programmes tailored to the needs of the semiconductor
industry, in partnership with universities and Chips Competence Centres. Programmes such as
Erasmus+ for STEM students, Digital Europe, Horizon Europe and European Social Fund
should be leveraged to build expertise in key areas like AI and connectivity chips, quantum
computing, advanced materials and MEMS/sensors.

- **EU Tech Talent Visa pathway** : The EU should simplify and harmonise work visa processes
across Member States by introducing a dedicated EU Tech Talent Visa. This would streamline
and accelerate entry for experts and scientists in key fields such as semiconductors. Special
provisions should be considered for mobile researchers and specialists to remove barriers and
foster cross-border collaboration, ensuring that Europe attracts and retains the best global
talent to strengthen its chips ecosystem.


**4** **Lead in green semiconductor manufacturing**


- Europe has an opportunity to become a global leader in sustainable semiconductor
manufacturing. The EU should direct funding, particularly in R&D, towards green technologies
with the greatest positive impact, including energy-efficient chip production, water
conservation, recyclable and sustainable materials, circularity and safer substances. A key
priority should be innovative material substitution and advanced recycling to cut dependence
on rare earths from third countries. Support should also cover semiconductors and
components that enable the green transition, such as integrated photonics, heterogeneous
integration and chips for renewable energy applications. By aligning industrial policy with
environmental objectives, Europe can combine technological innovation with climate
leadership and greater strategic autonomy.


**5** **Forge closer international partnerships**


- The EU should prioritise closer collaboration with like-minded countries such as the US, Japan,
Korea and Taiwan to strengthen supply chains, drive innovation and enhance resilience. This
should include promoting co-investments and technology partnerships with global leaders by
enabling partners to form joint ventures with EU firms and access EU-funded R&D
infrastructures, in line with the principle of open strategic autonomy. In parallel, the EU
should establish bi- and multilateral collaboration platforms on critical technologies such as
semiconductors (e.g. through Trade and Tech Councils) to align policies, foster digital
innovation and reinforce critical infrastructure and supply chain resilience.

**6** **Towards industrial-scale quantum chip production**


- **Fabrication support:** To reach systems with 100 error-corrected qubits by 2030, Europe
needs scalable public–private infrastructure and dedicated funding for startups and SMEs
developing quantum chips. The key challenge is moving from lab research to commercial
production, as superconducting chips use semiconductor-like methods but with materials that
contaminate standard tools. Dedicated production equipment for startups is therefore
essential to enable scaling.


- **Foundries and scale-up:** Large-scale foundries will be crucial to achieve cost efficiency and
production capacity. Shared clean-room facilities where multiple startups access production
tools can reduce contamination risks, maximise utilisation rates and accelerate the
commercialisation of superconducting quantum processors.


- **Roadmap 2026 and coordination:** The Quantum Chips Industrialisation Roadmap, due in
2026, should focus on targeted scale-up support and prepare for quantum-specialised fabs.
Coordination with the Chips Act 2.0 is essential to align funding instruments and secure longterm growth for European quantum developers.

- **Intellectual property and investment:** Clear IP ownership rules are vital in a sector
dominated by SMEs and rapid process evolution. Startups must retain control of proprietary
technologies, while foundries need legal certainty to build stable supply chains. Well-defined
IP distribution enables validated processes to be transferred to private fabs, giving investors
confidence and allowing firms to focus on innovation.


**7** **Strengthen governance, coordination and industry engagement**


- **Strengthen EU-level governance** : The European Semiconductor Board must be reinforced
with real coordinating powers, enabling pooling of national and EU resources to achieve
critical mass for projects of strategic importance. A consolidated and transparent overview of
all semiconductor investments across the Union is needed. Current arrangements leave the
Commission with only partial oversight of funding, which weakens alignment and slows
implementation.

- **Make industry consultation systematic and strategic** : The Industrial Alliance on
Semiconductors, alongside other representative bodies, should be given a more structured
role in advising on priorities, helping guide investment decisions, and informing crisis
preparedness. This would improve coherence between EU actions, Member State plans and
industry needs.

- **Streamline, not burden** : New measures related to economic security must avoid creating
additional administrative reporting. Coordination of national chips plans should focus on
alignment and efficiency, ensuring monitoring and crisis-response mechanisms function
effectively, rather than multiplying compliance costs for companies.

- **Ensure regulatory coherence** : The drafting and implementation of the Chips Act should
align closely with other EU legislation — such as the Quantum Act and Advanced Materials Act

  - to guarantee smooth interplay and strong complementarity across policy domains.


**8** **Key targets**


**Market share & competitiveness**


5 (6)


- Raise the EU’s share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity to at least 15% by 2035
(compared to ~8% today), with a focus on both advanced nodes and mainstream chips.

- Achieve global leadership in at least three mainstream or specialty chip niches (e.g. MEMS,
sensors, RF, photonics) by 2035, where EU companies already have a competitive edge.
