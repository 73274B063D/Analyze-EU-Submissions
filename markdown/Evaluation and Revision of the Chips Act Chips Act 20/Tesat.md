feedback: The EU's Chip Acts are necessary, but they are only one part of the story.
  In order to reach the goal, we also need the PCB and packaging industries in the
  EU. Close and aligned development and support of these industries is therefore essential
  to achieving the EU's strategic autonomy goal. The scope of the EU Chip Act (Chips
  Act 2) should therefore take this into account and allocate the necessary budget
  for PCB and packaging tasks to secure this.
