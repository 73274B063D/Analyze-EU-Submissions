feedback: 'Chips Act 1 was too focused on Research and Wafer-Fabrication. Build it
  and they will come will not work in Semiconductors. Chips Act 2 must focus much
  more on Fabless Semiconductor startups. The aim should be to create EU Unicorns
  like Qualcomm or Nvidia. This will need significant scale-up funding, for example
  encouraging EU pension funds to invest several percent in VC funds, like US (and
  like some Nordic countries). It will also need much-more European-led demand drivers:
  Software workloads by big EU players, Large-Language Models, Fintech software, etc
  all of which will generate more European buyers of chips from EU startups, for data-centers,
  robotics, infrastructure, fintech security, etc. Hopefully this essential collaboration
  across the stack (HW/SW/System/Application) will be a big focus of the upcoming
  EU DARE Digital Autonomy EU HPC Joint Undertaking. And finally - EU must waive or
  eliminate the UID Undertaking in Difficulty directive for Fabless Semi startups.
  All pre-revenue Fabless Semi''s with heavy investment are by definition UID with
  significant negative balance-sheets. In my current startup company we have received
  US grants, they never ask us for balance-sheet or Cash-flow or P&L!'
