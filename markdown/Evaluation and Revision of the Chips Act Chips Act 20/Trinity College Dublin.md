feedback: Europes semiconductor strategy must avoid the risk of directing most public
  funding toward large industrial actors while neglecting the foundational layers
  of the ecosystem, i.e. design tools, early-stage research infrastructure, and the
  skills pipeline. Providing funds to industry without strengthening the toolchain
  is dangerous, especially considering that nearly all critical Electronic Design
  Automation (EDA), verification, and cloud-based design environments are controlled
  by non-EU companies. If Europe rebuilds manufacturing capacity on top of external,
  licensed, and often opaque toolflows, it will remain strategically dependent even
  after investing billions in fabrication capacity. The chips ecosystem also needs
  greater diversity across application domains. Current policy often emphasises automotive,
  industrial controllers, or legacy embedded markets, but long-term competitiveness
  requires support for specialised chips in areas where Europe already has strong
  scientific and industrial depth, such as edge AI, telecommunications, biomedical
  systems, secure IoT, and energy-efficient AI accelerators. A crucial part of enabling
  this diversification is strengthening rapid prototyping and early-stage technology
  evaluation before fabrication. Academic research can make major contributions here
  yet is currently under supported. In parallel, hardware security must be elevated
  to a core objective of the Chips Act. The frequency of hardware-level attacks, trojans,
  and supply-chain compromises is rising sharply, and modern systems depend on secure-by-design
  components at all abstraction levels, from circuits to packaging to system integration.
  Without substantial investment in research on hardware assurance, open and transparent
  verification platforms, security-oriented design methodologies, and trusted test
  infrastructures, Europe risks creating advanced chipmaking capacity that is still
  vulnerable to manipulation, counterfeits, and external control points embedded in
  the toolchain. Finally, true security of supply cannot be achieved through factories
  alone. A resilient semiconductor ecosystem requires sovereign capability in design,
  modelling, verification, packaging, testing, and system-level integration. Strengthening
  shared research facilities, open-source tool development, and training programmes
  will ensure that European engineers, SMEs, and universities can participate in the
  full semiconductor value chain. Balancing industrial subsidies with investments
  in tools, talent, and hardware security is the only sustainable path to real technological
  sovereignty and long-term supply-chain resilience for Europe.
