feedback: The Chips Act has launched a strategical very important dynamic from the
  top, i.e. concerning firstly large mainstream industry / nanotechnology fabrication
  (e.g.pilot lines), then specialized processes / applications (e.g. wide band gap
  for power, photonics ...). The next phase could more (or better) consider (i.e.
  fund) the long-term overall knowledge supply chain starting from the bottom, i.e.
  universities, small research centers ... as well as niche but high-added value innovations
  of SMEs.
