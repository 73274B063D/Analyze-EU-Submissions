feedback: 'I welcome the EU''s initiative to review and strengthen the Chips Act.
  While the regulation has already demonstrated significant impact, there is a critical
  gap that needs to be addressed to achieve true technological sovereignty: comprehensive
  support for chip design training, research infrastructure, and experimental validation
  capabilities within the EU. The EU''s semiconductor strategy needs to prioritise
  the development of highly skilled designers and researchers. The Chips Act should
  include dedicated provisions for industry-aligned training programmes that equip
  professionals and researchers with practical chip design expertise, as well as collaborative
  initiatives between academia and industry to ensure training reflects current technological
  demands. Most importantly, dedicated funding schemes for institutes active in IC
  and chip design are essential. Current funding mechanisms often fail to adequately
  support research institutions engaged in IC design activities. This is perhaps the
  critical gap in the current framework. Many funding calls are not specifically targeted
  at the fabrication and experimental validation phases of chip design. For many designers
  and researchers, these stages are not supported by their host institutions, creating
  a significant barrier to innovation. I strongly advocate for the inclusion of a
  dedicated scheme within the revised Chips Act that specifically covers fabrication
  costs for prototype and experimental chips, testing and characterisation expenses,
  multi-project wafer access, and post-fabrication analysis and evaluation. This support
  is particularly crucial for advanced microsystems, including RFICs, AI-centric chip
  architectures, and emerging sensor systems, which will form the foundations of the
  future digital economy and societal advancements, as well as critical national sectors
  such as defence, automotive, robotics, and telecommunications. The IHP Open PDK
  pilot programme has demonstrated a successful model that should be expanded and
  institutionalised within the Chips Act. This initiative has shown that providing
  accessible design tools and fabrication support enables broader participation in
  chip design research, faster innovation cycles, and reduced barriers for academic
  and small-scale research projects. I have personally benefited from the existence
  of such a scheme, through which one of my projects on the design of next-generation
  on-chip beamforming systems (as attached) has been approved and is being fabricated.
  I hope the Act will facilitate ongoing budget allocation to keep this initiative
  active and, where possible, expand and scale it. By incorporating dedicated provisions
  for chip design training, research funding, and experimental fabrication support,
  the EU can develop a resilient, innovative semiconductor ecosystem that reduces
  strategic dependencies and positions the EU as a global leader in advanced chip
  technologies.'
