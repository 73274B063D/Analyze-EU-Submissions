feedback: The current investments in Europe's semiconductor ecosystem are generating
  strong momentum and thereby strengthening the region's competitiveness and resilience
  within the global industry. However, the continued investment in Europe's semiconductor
  capacity is crucial to ensure technological autonomy and the security of its supply
  chain. Next-generation packaging technologies, including 3D stacking, heterogeneous
  integration, advanced interposers, chiplet architectures, and high-density fan-out
  packaging, present a strategic opportunity for Europe to lead the development of
  more energy-efficient, higher-performance, and functionally diverse semiconductor
  systems, independent of continued transistor scaling. The demand for advanced semiconductor
  packaging is already surging, driven by the rapid growth in the adoption of 2.5D/3D
  integration, hybrid bonding, and chiplet-based designs for artificial intelligence
  (AI), high-performance computing, and 5G/Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
  It is evident that prominent industry leaders in the semiconductor manufacturing
  sector, such as TSMC, Intel, AMD, and leading OSATs, are allocating substantial
  resources to the development and implementation of these advanced technologies.
  This strategic investment aims to overcome the inherent limitations of conventional
  scaling methodologies and to align with the stringent specifications required for
  next-generation systems.
