feedback: EUROPRACTICE's activity is essential for many research groups in Europe,
  as otherwise it would not be possible to cover the costs of software tools and silicon
  samples. This initiative must therefore be maintained if the fields of semiconductors
  and microelectronics are to be strengthened. As regards EU investment in the semiconductor
  and microelectronics sector, I do not see any practical advantages in terms of access
  to funding compared to other thematic areas. As a strategic topic, the participation
  of experienced research groups should be encouraged and funding should reach a wider
  group of beneficiaries, provided, of course, that the quality of the proposals reaches
  a certain threshold.
