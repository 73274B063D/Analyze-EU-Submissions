feedback: Chips Act2 should promote those semiconductor technologies where european
  industry could harness the effort (automotive, aerospace, energy, medical) and those
  topics that could produce a noticeable impact in medium term (2D materials, sensors,
  photonics, RF). Try to secure production inside Europe with companies owned by european
  countries (not by China or USA). Research and innovation should include academia,
  with smaller teams colaborating with other greater players and industries. Training
  next generation of semiconductor experts is mandatory to secure the independence
  of Europe. Access to Pilot lines and prototyping is an excellent idea that should
  be reinforced.
