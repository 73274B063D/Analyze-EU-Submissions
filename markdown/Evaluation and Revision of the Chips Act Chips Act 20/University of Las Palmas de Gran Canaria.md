feedback: 'As a scientific researcher and university educator, I would like to provide
  a brief analysis in response to the EU Chips Act review consultation [1]. My views
  are based on four main hypotheses that align with the replies of the European Commission
  to the European Court of Auditors 12/2025 report [2, 3]. 1.- Chips are not alone.
  Other technologies, such as computer programming, are necessary for chips to function
  properly in solving citizens'' problems. A significant percentage of the demand
  for chips is due to the creation or existence of software. Software is what ultimately
  automates the solution of problems for citizens, companies, institutions, etc. It
  is also necessary to invest in the software that makes chips work to solve problems.
  An obvious example is Artificial Intelligence software applications, such as those
  integrated into autonomous vehicle driving. 2.- More intercontinental cooperation
  is needed. I believe that the term sovereignty is inappropriate because it distracts
  from real opportunities. It is unlikely that Europe will achieve absolute independence
  in the chip supply chain in the short or medium term [2]. Therefore, strategic alliances
  with other experienced players outside Europe are needed to respond to future chip
  supply crises. These alliances must be established from the strongest possible strategic
  position. One way to achieve such a position of strength could be the creation of
  a European Chip Agency. This agency could not only implement and coordinate the
  economic management of European investment in chip manufacturing infrastructure
  but also manage and implement the main strategies for chip research, development,
  and manufacturing in Europe. It could also play a key role in establishing intercontinental
  relations with Europe. A precursor to this potential agency could be the Europractice
  consortium [4], a successor to Eurochip (1989-1995). Europractice already receives
  funding from the European Union''s Chips Joint Undertaking. 3. More services to
  improve the efficiency of existing chips. Chip manufacturing may not be economically
  viable in Europe due to insufficient demand to make investments profitable. The
  limited size and fragmentation of European chip demand across different types of
  chips means that producing at scale for the European market alone will be very difficult
  [5]. However, other solutions are possible, such as providing services that optimise
  the use of new or existing infrastructure in times of shortage. In other words,
  rather than producing new chips, we could reuse and increase the efficiency of existing
  ones. For instance, strategies involving refurbishing used chips and providing software
  services, such as reducing the ''instruction footprint'' to optimise their use long
  after their manufacture date, could alleviate a potential temporary shortage [6].
  4. Fundamental and applied research and training for professionals must be strengthened
  and guided by the technology industry''s demands. Research and training centres
  should be located closer to industries, rather than the other way around. To this
  end, industries and Research & Education centres should be concentrated in parts
  of Europe that have already been named ''technological valleys'' [7]. References:
