feedback: The Chips Act is useful in many ways to academic institution. For instance,
  through the Chips JU it is possible to participate to competitive calls for research
  projects devoted to strengthen the EU position in the semiconductor strategic industry.
  Moreover, it fosters the exchange of ideas, practices, and knowledge across EU countries.
  Another important asset that (partially) receives funding from the Chips Act is
  the Europractice platform, that allows access to many services related to semiconductors
  such as wafer runs by many different EU institutions, and simulation softwares at
  sustainable prices. These services are of particular interest to academic institutions,
  as they lower the barriers for accessing the latest technologies.
