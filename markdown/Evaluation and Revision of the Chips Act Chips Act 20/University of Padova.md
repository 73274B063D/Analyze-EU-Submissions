  faces a severe shortage of skilled professionals in microelectronics. Without robust
  initiatives like Europractice, it would be nearly impossible for academic programs
  to prepare students for careers in this demanding field. As Europe advances through
  initiatives such as the Chips Act, maintaining and expanding Europractice is vital.

  and strengthening support for small prototyping volumes, which are indispensable
