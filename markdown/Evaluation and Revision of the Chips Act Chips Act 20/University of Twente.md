# **Summary University of Twente, The Netherlands,** **by Prof Bram Nauta.** **Strategic Feedback for the European Chip Act**




- **Current Situation**
Europe’s semiconductor share has dropped to ~10% and risks falling to 5% as the global market
doubles. Existing European fabs (ST, GlobalFoundries, Intel Ireland) are limited to older nodes (>
10nm), while advanced fabs mainly serve U.S.-based fabless companies.

- **Key Challenges**




`o` Building new advanced fabs in Europe is costly, slow, and does not solve the lack of a
European fabless ecosystem.

`o` Europe has few significant fabless players; recent acquisitions (e.g., Dialog → Renesas) further
weaken the base.

`o` Workforce shortage and long lead times limit rapid capacity expansion.

- **Strategic Imperative**




`o` **Do not focus solely on buying fabs** —this is a short-term fix that fails to address Europe’s
strategic vulnerability.

`o` **Build an ecosystem** : Invest in fabless design companies, talent development, and nextgeneration technologies.

`o` **Leverage strengths** : Europe excels in analog/RF; expand into digital and software design.

`o` **Future-oriented R&D** : Prepare for post-4nm technologies (e.g., vertical transistors, 3D
stacking) that can be mass-produced at low cost.

- **Action Plan**



1. **Invest in design talent** through universities and research institutions.
2. **Support IMEC, LETI, and similar centers** for advanced technology development.
3. **Create incentives for fabless startups** to grow a European customer base.
4. Combine **public and private funding** with a long-term vision (10–20 years).


**Bottom Line:** Europe’s strategic autonomy in semiconductors depends on creating a robust design and
innovation ecosystem—not just building fabs. Focus on future technologies and talent to regain relevance.
