  -Build an ecosystem: Invest in fabless design companies, talent development, and
  next-generation technologies. -Leverage strengths: Europe excels in analog/RF; expand

  (e.g., vertical transistors, 3D stacking) that can be mass-produced at low cost.

  -Support IMEC, LETI, and similar centers for advanced technology development. -Create
