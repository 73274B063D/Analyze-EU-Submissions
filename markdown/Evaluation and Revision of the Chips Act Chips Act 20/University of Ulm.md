feedback: The key significance of the European Chips Act lies in its comprehensive
  framing of Chips spanning research, design, EDA tools, manufacturing, supply-chain
  resilience, and sustainability as a strategic foundation for Europes technological
  future. Its three pillars Chips for Europe, the investment framework for manufacturing,
  and supply-chain monitoring form the core of this strategy by strengthening innovation
  capacity, production capabilities, and overall ecosystem stability. As an academic
  institution, we contribute through education, research collaboration, and innovation.
  Sustained R&D funding, together with continued support for enabling organisations
  such as Europractice, remains crucial to achieving the Acts objectives.
