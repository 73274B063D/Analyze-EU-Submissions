  landscape. It delivered long-needed political momentum and enabled the first concrete
  steps toward rebuilding advanced fabrication capacity, notably through the creation
  of the European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) by Infineon, NXP, Bosch
  and TSMC. Yet these measures remain insufficient for reaching the EUs 20% market-share
  target by 2028 or for ensuring long-term resilience. Several private-sector initiatives
  have already been delayed or reduced, including Intels projects in France and Germany,
  uncertainty around STMicroelectronics future footprint, and the gradual loss of
  legacy production such as NXPs Nijmegen line. These developments underline the fragility
  of the European ecosystem. A central difficulty is that, unlike aircraft manufacturingwhere
  the Airbus model succeeded because it produced a standardized, certifiable product
  with predictable demandsemiconductors do not benefit from stable, uniform market
  structures. Products differ widely across applications and evolve on short timescales.
  Simply providing fabrication capacity does not ensure that it will be used. Demand
  must be deliberately created; otherwise, the facilities established under Chips
  Act 1 risk underutilization. Chips Act 2.0 must therefore address both supply and
  demand in a coordinated manner. In this context, the University of Zurich proposes
  actions to better align research, infrastructure and industrial activity. A key
  element is the introduction of regular multi-project wafer (MPW) runs at mature
  nodes within ESMC. Although the planned 1210 nm capability is strategically valuable,
  much of Europes applied research and industrial electronics still relies on 135,
  80, 65 and 28 nm technologies. Quarterly MPW runs supported by open or semi-open
  PDKs would enable universities, SMEs and research groups to design and prototype
  domestically. Publicly funded research projects involving IC design should, when
  technically feasible, be expected to use European manufacturing infrastructure to
  reinforce this pipeline and create predictable baseline demand. A longer-term objective
  is to strengthen Europes supply chain, including wafer production, post-processing,
  packaging and testing. Europe does not need to replicate the dense Asian fab clusters;
  a coordinated, distributed model is possible, but only if policy actively shapes
  demand through procurement commitments and targeted incentives. Defence procurement
  is an obvious mechanism: requiring a defined share of defence-related ICs to be
  produced within Europe would provide essential stability during early operation.
  Design enablement also requires attention. EUROPRACTICE should evolve from a license
  distributor to a technical support hub capable of assisting institutions moving
  toward open EDA toolchains. Zero-cost MPW access for open-PDK designs would reduce
  financial barriers and encourage domestic prototyping. In parallel, AI-assisted
  design tools can broaden participation, even if full automation remains a long-term
  objective. Europe must also address the shortage of skilled fab operators by supporting
  apprenticeships in lithography, etching, deposition and packagingareas that cannot
  be replaced by automation. Cryogenic electronics represent a final strategic domain.
  Although Europe invests heavily in quantum technologies, cryo-CMOS development remains
  limited. The GlobalFoundries 65 nm process is already well studied at low temperatures

The implementation of the first EU Chips Act has marked an essential turning point for
Europe’s semiconductor landscape, providing long-awaited political momentum and
enabling the first steps toward industrial consolidation. The establishment of the European
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC), jointly backed by Infineon, NXP, Bosch
and TSMC, represents a decisive step toward rebuilding advanced fabrication capabilities
on European soil. Yet despite this progress, the measures enacted so far remain insufficient
to secure the European Union’s strategic objective of reaching 20% global market share by
2028 and ensuring the long-term resilience of its semiconductor supply chains. With privatesector projects facing postponements or cancellations—including Intel’s planned
investments in France and Germany—alongside uncertainty regarding STMicroelectronics’
long-term European employment footprint and the progressive decline of legacy
manufacturing capacity such as NXP’s Nijmegen line, Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem
remains fragile, fragmented, and incomplete.


A central reason for this fragility is that, unlike commercial aircraft manufacturing where the
Airbus model succeeded through the production of a standardized, certifiable product with
naturally stable demand, the semiconductor sector is intrinsically heterogeneous. Its
products vary across applications, lifecycles are short, and innovation cycles are rapid.
Capacity alone does not generate demand. Unlike aviation, where political coordination was
sufficient to secure long-term orders, semiconductor manufacturing requires deliberate,
structured mechanisms to channel European research, design activity, industrial needs,
and public procurement toward domestic fabrication. Without such demand-shaping
interventions, the capacity created under Chips Act 1 risks underutilization.


In this context, the University of Zurich proposes an integrated set of actions intended to
structure the next phase of the Chips Act and to ensure that research, infrastructure,
workforce development, and industrial activity evolve not independently but as a
coordinated ecosystem. A first component is the establishment of regular multi-project
wafer (MPW) research runs within ESMC at mature technology nodes. Although the planned
12–10 nm capability at the Dresden facility is of high strategic value, innovation across
Europe depends predominantly on accessible production at 135, 80, 65 and 28 nm nodes,
where most mixed-signal, power, automotive and industrial electronics are still
manufactured. Integrating quarterly MPW runs and developing open-source PDKs modeled


on the SkyWater approach would allow universities, SMEs and research groups to prototype
rapidly while cultivating a broad and sustainable design ecosystem. To reinforce this
integration, EU-funded research projects—particularly ERC, Pathfinder and Synergy grants
involving semiconductor design or fabrication—should be required to use European
manufacturing infrastructure whenever technically feasible. Such alignment is a crucial
mechanism for generating the structured, predictable demand that purely market-driven
conditions cannot provide.


A further long-term strategic imperative is consolidating a fully European semiconductor
supply chain covering substrate and wafer production, post-processing, packaging and
testing. While such a distributed supply chain is more complex than the geographically
dense clusters that dominate in East Asia, it is nonetheless achievable under an Airbus-style
governance framework—provided that the EU actively engineers the necessary demand and
coordination mechanisms. Relocating vulnerable supply-chain segments to or initiating
them within Europe, with particular attention to underrepresented northern or southern
European member states with strong industrial capacity, would substantially enhance
resilience. Defence procurement should likewise be aligned with Europe’s semiconductor
strategy, with a requirement that at least a portion of defence-related integrated circuits be
produced domestically. A phased approach beginning with low-complexity components
would enable manageable technology transfer while strengthening security of supply and
guaranteeing baseline orders for domestic facilities.


Reform of EUROPRACTICE is also necessary. Its longstanding role as an intermediary for
commercial EDA tool licensing must evolve into a broader function as a design-knowledge
hub supporting open-source toolchains. Rather than directing public funds toward
commercial license agreements, the European research community would benefit from
engineering support, shared expertise, and educational frameworks enabling students and
SMEs to adopt open EDA flows. Complementing this shift, the development of open PDKs
should be systematically supported through zero-cost MPW runs for open designs, allowing
early-stage innovators to transition from conceptual work to manufacturable prototypes
without prohibitive financial barriers. These measures directly expand the base of designers
who can realistically bring work into European fabs, thereby contributing to the sustained
demand that such facilities require.


Further lowering entry barriers will require advances in automation. Europe should
encourage the development of AI-assisted IC design tools capable of translating higher-level
descriptions into manufacturing-compatible layouts using open PDKs. Although full
automation of RTL-to-GDS flows is not yet mature, partial automation can already broaden
access to semiconductor design across academic and industrial domains, helping to


generate the design activity needed to sustain a diverse user base. In parallel, Chips Act 2.0
must address the persistent shortage of skilled fab operators by subsidizing apprenticeships
and technician training programs, especially in lithography, etching, deposition,
implantation and packaging. Such skills are indispensable and cannot be replaced easily by
automation, making them crucial for operational stability and manufacturing yield.


A final strategic dimension concerns cryogenic electronics, which have become essential
components of quantum sensing and quantum computing systems. Although the EU has
invested heavily in quantum hardware through initiatives such as Quantum Flagship and
IPCEI Quantum, the development of cryogenic CMOS electronics remains insufficiently
supported. Chips Act 2.0 should therefore subsidize the development and fabrication of
cryo-optimized circuits, in particular leveraging the GlobalFoundries 65 nm platform, which
already possesses device models suitable for temperatures down to a few kelvin. Integrating
such capabilities with ESMC and European quantum research consortia—and establishing
MPW runs dedicated to cryogenic applications—would ensure that Europe retains
leadership in quantum science while developing industrial capabilities that are otherwise
emerging predominantly in the United States and East Asia. This represents yet another
domain where demand must be deliberately shaped: quantum technologies will not
naturally gravitate toward European fabs unless the necessary incentives and infrastructure
are in place.


Collectively, these measures would help ensure that Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem
becomes more resilient, more integrated, and more strategically aligned with long-term
scientific and industrial needs. Crucially, they move beyond the supply-side logic of the first
Chips Act—where capacity was created but demand left largely uncoordinated—and
instead establish the foundation for a sustainable, self-reinforcing semiconductor value
chain. They respond to systemic weaknesses in the current industrial landscape and offer
concrete pathways for securing technological sovereignty while enabling research and
innovation to flourish within a European manufacturing infrastructure.
