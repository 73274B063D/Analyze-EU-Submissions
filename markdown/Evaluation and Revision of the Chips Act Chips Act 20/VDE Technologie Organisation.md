### 1. The importance of microelectronics for innovations in Germany/Europe



Since the chip shortage, which severely affected
large parts of the German economy during the
coronavirus pandemic, it has become clear that
Europe’s industries need a crisis-proof supply of
microchips in order to manufacture their products
and systems. Integrated circuits, known as chips,
are indispensable core elements of all electronic
systems, enabling product innovations and thus
finding use in everyday life. Integrated circuits
can be found in almost all commercially available
devices today, not only in data centers, smartphones, tablets, and laptops, but also in smart
meters, medical devices, security systems, extended reality (XR) systems, sensors (such as video
cameras, radar/lidar systems, and laser sensors),
household appliances, weather stations, as well as
in vehicles, drones, satellites, robots, and generally
in mechanical and plant engineering products.
The crisis-proof availability of chips is a key prerequisite for securing Germany’s – and thus Europe’s

- long-term competitiveness. It forms the basis for
driving innovation and competing internationally
with both new and established products. Against
this backdrop, the major European initiatives to
strengthen microelectronics are the right move.
However, they do not go far enough to achieve the
stated goal of a 20% share of global semiconductor
production. Europe currently has a share of just
under 8%, and with the amounts currently being
invested in Europe, this share will not increase but
will remain the same at best.


An example: Since 2020, Chinese companies have
been subject to the US embargo on devices in the
field of information technology and telecommunications. This applies in particular to chips manufactured in “advanced technology nodes,” i.e., semiconductor chips with the smallest structures that
have the best parameters in terms of computing
power and energy consumption. The US cannot
completely eliminate China from the competition,
but it can significantly slow it down. However, the
US strategy is unlikely to have a lasting effect, as
China is investing considerable sums in building
up its own semiconductor industry. It is likely that
China will succeed in developing its own manufacturing capacities for “advanced technology nodes”
in order to counteract US efforts to cut China off
from access to these chips. Innovative strength
and technological progress – particularly in
the development and manufacture of chips –
are among China’s top economic priorities.



It is unclear what would happen if geopolitical
conditions changed in such a way that unforeseen
new dependencies arose in the chip market and
the supply of chips of the required specifications,
quality, and quantity to European industry could no
longer be guaranteed. Such scenarios are being
discussed and played out in think tanks. As Europe
has lost significant ground in microelectronics over
the last twenty years, it would only play a marginal
role without effective measures being taken at an
early stage.


The complexity of both military and critical infrastructures requires access to a multitude of different system components, which are built based on
the entire range of semiconductor devices. These
infrastructures are therefore critically dependent on
the availability of state-of-the-art microelectronics,
and thus on chips fabricated in advanced technology nodes. The war in Ukraine has shown that
defense capabilities require systems that combine
artificial intelligence (AI) with state-of-the-art sensor
technology and secure information and communication technology (ICT). Robotics and edge
AI-based autonomous systems are becoming increasingly important in this context. Edge AI means
that artificial intelligence works directly where the
data is generated – for example, in a robot, a
sensor, a drone, an emergency vehicle, another
enabled end device, or even nearby local infrastructure nodes (such as a base station, a switch,
or a router). Information is not first transferred to
large data centers or into the cloud, but can be
processed immediately onsite or very close by,
“on the edge”. Europe today has a strength in
edge AI technologies.


Chips are the central backbone of data centers
and cloud-based services. In order to maintain
progress in the field of large language models
(LLM) and thus generative AI, advanced technology
is needed, especially in so-called “hyperscalers”,
the powerful data centers that represent the infrastructure of modern cloud AI. The main components for data centers are processors, memory
and ICT. The latest semiconductor technologies,
the “advanced technology nodes”, are generally
used to fabricate these, along with the associated
3D packaging and assembly and ICT systems. In
particular, hyperscalers use custom-made chip
architectures that are specifically tailored to the
requirements and needs of data centers and, in



VDE Position Paper – Hidden Electronics IV 3


particular, AI applications, such as those developed and offered by Nvidia. The development of
chips designed even more specifically for AI requirements was marked by Google’s TPU (Tensor
Processing Unit) architecture. In the meantime,
however, companies such as Amazon and Microsoft have also built up their own expertise in chip
design in order to equip their data centers with
customized chips. Without access to state-ofthe-art technology, products from Europe’s core
industries will no longer be competitive. The lack
of key components due to sanctions could hinder



the establishment of successful start-ups. The
specialized system and application expertise essential for chip design and development would be
lost, severely impacting customer industries. As a
result, their products would be relegated to mere
“me-too” or a follower status, lacking competitive
differentiation. Ultimately, this would also affect
European consumers, the market, as well as the
entire society and the attractiveness of Europe as
a business location.



We use the terms “microelectronics,” “microchips,” and “semiconductors”
in this position paper.


Microelectronics is a field of electronics that deals with the development, manufacture, and application of integrated circuits and electronic components at the microscopic level. It is characterized
by key features such as miniaturization, high integration, and the integration of software, which
enables complex functions to be implemented efficiently in compact devices.


Microchips consist of miniaturized electronic components integrated on a semiconductor chip.
They are designed for a wide range of applications, including logic circuits, memory functions,
analog processing, sensor technology, and power control. Due to their versatility, microchips are
used in numerous devices and technologies, from smartphones to industrial control systems.


Semiconductors are materials that have electrical properties between those of conductors (e.g.,
metals) and insulators (e.g., glass). They can be modified by doping (inserting foreign atoms) to
control their conductivity. Semiconductors are the basis for the fabrication of microelectronics and
microchips, as with them electronic and optical signals can be engineered in a controlled manner.

## 2. The microelectronics ecosystem



Microelectronics depends on a complex, highly
specialized ecosystem with extensive collaboration among stakeholders. Key aspects include:


- Application expertise, which is primarily incorporated into application-specific chips the so
called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits
(ASICs). Germany and Europe have considerable application expertise, for example through
their strong position in the automotive industry,
mechanical engineering, robotics, and medical
technology.


- Expertise in chip design is needed to design
chips that can either be used in a variety of
contexts (e.g., processors such as CPUs,
GPUs, or microcontrollers, memory, power
semiconductors, discrete microelectronic
components in general) or are specialized for a
specific task. In Europe, chip design expertise
is mainly located at the large IDMs (Integrated
Device Manufacturers), which design chips
for their own use and then manufacture them
themselves or have them manufactured by
global contract manufacturers.


- Chip manufacturing comprises wafer production

  - known as front-end manufacturing – as well
as the packaging of chips in housings – known
as back-end manufacturing of chips – and testing
to ensure functionality and reliability. Traditionally, wafer fabrication was considered highly
demanding, yet it is characterized by a high
degree of automation. In contrast, packaging
and circuit testing were seen as labor-intensive
and less technology-driven – classic tasks outsourced to low-wage locations. This has been
changing for several years now. Packaging is
becoming more technologically demanding,
driven by chiplet concepts, for example, and
the requirements for manufacturing testing
are also increasing. In Europe, Dresden is the
largest fabrication site, with major chip fabs
located there. Other important sites in Europe
are located in France, Italy Ireland. All of these
sites have limited testing capacities. Packaging
in Europe, except in Portugal and Malta, is only
carried out for special-themed chips.


- Last but not least, the supplier industries
play an essential role in ensuring a smoothly functioning ecosystem. This includes, for
example, the production of silicon wafers (e.g.,
Siltronic), materials and specialty chemicals for
production (e.g., BASF, Merck), and equipment
for semiconductor manufacturing (e.g., ASML



in the Netherlands and its German suppliers
Zeiss and Trumpf, e.g. Aixtron, Süss) as well
as software tools (“EDA tools”) for the highly
complex task of chip design.


The capital markets rate microelectronics expertise
extremely high as an essential industry of the
future. Nvidia, a fabless company (without its own
manufacturing facilities), based on expertise in chip
design, is currently the most valuable company in
the world, worth about 1.5 times as much as all
companies in the DAX 40 combined. TSMC, the
world’s leading contract manufacturer (foundry),
is worth about half as much as all DAX 40 companies combined. ASML from the Netherlands, a
highly specialized lithography equipment company,
is more valuable than the entire German automotive tier 1.


The semiconductor ecosystem is highly intertwined
worldwide, with very large mutual dependencies.
This dependency has arisen as a result of global
division of labor and specialization. Striving for selfsufficiency is not possible, especially for Europe,
but also for other major regions of the world, and
would also be an economic step backward. On
the other hand, unilateral dependencies in the development and manufacture of semiconductors or
Europe’s overall lack of importance in this area are
extremely dangerous and can lead to blackmail or
existential damage in the event of a crisis. Instead
of self-sufficiency, the goal should be sovereignty
and resilience of the local ecosystem. Sovereignty
can be ensured by mastering all the essential skills
required in the ecosystem, or by dominating a sufficient number of critical skills so that other regions
of the world are at least as dependent on Europe
as Europe is on other regions (concept of “mutual
dependence”).


Europe’s strengths lie in EUV technology, semiconductors in the areas of edge AI, crypto chips,
and power semiconductors, sensors and semiconductor components for analog functions, and
optoelectronic semiconductor components. Europe plays a minor role in processors and no role
at all in memory components. However, it is precisely these components that are also needed for
modern applications such as artificial intelligence.
It is in Europe’s best interests to regain influence in
the field of logic and memory production. Strategic
technology partnerships as well as setting up
manufacturing facilities of foreign companies in
Europe will help to achieve this.



VDE Position Paper – Hidden Electronics IV 5


## 3. Examples of success



Example 1 – Construction of the Dresden
chip factories: After the fall of the Iron Curtain,
projects were sought that could help rebuild the
economy of eastern Germany. The semiconductor industry was experiencing strong growth at
the time, and Siemens was persuaded to build
its new chip factory in Dresden, a location where
semiconductors had been manufactured during
the GDR era. The factory was planned, built, and
went into operation in 1996, almost 30 years
ago. Shortly thereafter, Siemens teamed up with
Motorola to develop the world’s first factory with
300 mm wafers for the memory chip sector.
Developments continued at a rapid pace: the
AMD/GlobalFoundries factory was built, Bosch
joined later, and plans are currently underway to
build a chip factory for the European joint venture
between TSMC, Bosch, Infineon, and NXP.
Over the past 30 years, Saxony has succeeded
in establishing a strong European semiconductor
ecosystem.


Example 2 – European funding for microelectronics is having an impact: In 2018, Europe
approved the first IPCEI (Important Projects of
Common European Interest) program for microelectronics, which allows the European Commission to grant aid to companies in member states
for projects with a very high level of innovation.
A total of 32 companies from five European
countries received funding. Among other things,
IPCEI-I funds were used to support Bosch’s 300
mm factory in Dresden. In IPCEI-II, which was
approved in 2023, a total of 68 projects from 14
European countries were funded, with a focus on
communication (5G and 6G), autonomous driving,

## 4. Status Quo


Reading through the above examples of success,
one might get the impression that “everything
is fine, Europe has a strong microelectronics
industry” – unfortunately, this is only partially true.
Indeed, it is important to highlight positive examples in order to demonstrate Europe’s capabilities.
At the same time, it must be clear that microelectronics, due to its position as a key industry, is
strongly controlled and promoted by governments
worldwide. The microelectronics market is not a



artificial intelligence, quantum computing, energy
generation, distribution, and use. As a further
step, the European Chips Act enables targeted
funding for research infrastructures, production
facilities, and crisis management. Support for production facilities ultimately led to the positive decision to locate the ESMC semiconductor factory in
Dresden, a joint venture involving Taiwanese chip
manufacturer TSMC and European companies
Bosch, Infineon, and NXP. Both the IPCEI programs and the European Chips Act are essential
elements in strengthening European microelectronics and are of great strategic importance.


Example 3 – The path to becoming the global
market leader for lithography machines: ASML
began developing lithography equipment in the
1980s, the machines used to lithographically
generate the finest structures onto semiconductor wafers. ASML and its Japanese competitors
faced the challenge that fabrication structures
that are much smaller than the wavelength of the
light could only be optically imaged using many
tricks. The reduction in the wavelength of the
exposure machines stagnated at 193 nm due to
numerous technical difficulties. ASML therefore
researched a completely new generation of
devices that use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light
with a wavelength of 13.5 nm to create the finest
structures on the wafers and cooperated with its
German partners Zeiss (for the optics) and Trumpf
(for the generation and processing of EUV light).
ASML is currently the only company in the world
capable of building equipment for the manufacture of chips with structures smaller than 5 nm.


free market that functions solely according to the
rules of competition.


From the very beginning, the semiconductor
industry has been significantly supported and
guided by government programs. Silicon Valley
has benefited greatly from government assistance
from large DARPA projects and other programs.
Europe lacks an effective technology agency
such as DARPA to initiate, develop, and imple


VDE Position Paper – Hidden Electronics IV 6


ment groundbreaking, transformative, and disruptive technologies. In Japan, local companies were
supported by the then powerful MITI (Ministry of
International Trade and Industry), and in Taiwan,
the ITRI research institute laid the foundation for
the semiconductor manufacturer TSMC. In Korea,
the development and manufacture of memory
semiconductors began very early on and was
supported by strong programs. In the 1980s,
Europe launched the EUREKA program JESSI,
which was intended to support the entire European semiconductor industry. In 2000, Europe
had a share of approximately 20% of global semiconductor production, which has fallen steadily in
subsequent years to just under 8% today. Today,
Europe no longer has any memory manufacturers
and plays almost no role in logic devices. Europe,
on the other hand, has strengths in the areas of
analog, power, and opto semiconductors, as well
as sensors.


Another segmentation can be made along the
value chain. This segmentation starts with basic
materials and media and continues with manufacturing equipment, semiconductor production,
design tools, chip design, testing, and packaging.
The status of the European semiconductor industry also varies significantly along the value chain.

Most manufacturers of wafer base materials
are now located in Asia. A major factor is that
the production of wafer base materials requires
a great deal of electrical energy. High energy
prices in Europe make this very difficult economically. Exceptions are special materials, such as
substrate materials for power semiconductors,
composite materials, or special substrates with
buried oxides.


Among European equipment manufacturers,
ASML is particularly noteworthy as it is currently
the only manufacturer of EUV lithography systems, which are needed to produce chips with
structures smaller than 5 nm. There are several
clusters in Europe where semiconductors are
manufactured, but new semiconductor factories
are (almost) only being built if they receive
government support at their respective locations.
Due to increasingly unfavorable competitive conditions, only a few new semiconductor factories
have been built in Europe in recent years.


Furthermore, design tools are currently dominated
by three large companies: Synopsys, Cadence,
and Mentor Graphics, which was acquired by
Siemens. Europe has only a few stand-alone chip



design companies, known as fabless companies,
with most design activities taking place at large
semiconductor manufacturers for their own use.
Europe now plays almost no role in testing and
packaging, except in niche areas.


In the recent past, microelectronics has been
considered important for the German innovation
ecosystem by government actors. The Federal
Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy has
provided particular support to the industry, and
the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology,
and Space has continuously promoted research
in microelectronics. Important milestones include
the establishment of the Research Factory Microelectronics Germany (FMD), FORLAB, QNC, and

- together with the EU Commission – the pilot
line for heterogeneous integration APECS. The excellent research environment and well-developed
ecosystem help that international companies are
also expanding their development activities in
Europe.


The efforts in Europe and its member states to
promote the European semiconductor industry
are considerable, but in this global market, it is
also necessary to keep an eye on the programs
of other regions of the world. From this perspective, support in Europe appears important, but
not sufficient. Even with the current programs,
the share of semiconductor production in Europe
will continue to decline in percentage terms because other regions of the world have launched
disproportionately large programs to expand their
respective microelectronics activities. According
to Semi, more than 100 semiconductor factories
will be built worldwide by 2030, only a small proportion of which will be in Europe. In addition to
semiconductor production, efforts in research and
development are also essential for the innovation
and competitiveness of European industry.
Recent geopolitical developments in the technology dispute between the US and China have
shown that technologies are only unrestrictedly
and reliably available if they are based on sovereign intellectual property and can therefore also
be controlled by Europe.



VDE Position Paper – Hidden Electronics IV 7


## 5. Misconceptions and false arguments



Misconception 1 – Semiconductor
manufacturers earn enough; support
is unnecessary:
The semiconductor business is a cyclical
business with strong fluctuations both upwards
and downwards. On average, revenues in the
semiconductor industry fluctuate by an order of
magnitude greater than gross domestic product.
During the financial crisis, for example, there were
declines of up to 60-70%, although these were
quickly offset in subsequent quarters. When
business is doing well, it is therefore necessary
to earn above-average amounts in order to
have sufficient reserves for the critical years.
Investments in the semiconductor industry are
extremely capital-intensive. The conditions for
investments are therefore crucial in the selection
of a location for manufacturing. A semiconductor
manufacturer will compare and assess global location conditions when making major investment
decisions. Government subsidies are not the only
prerequisite for large-scale investments, but they
are a necessary prerequisite for implementing the
investment. The conclusion is clear: If Europe
is willing to provide targeted support, the chances
of attracting new companies will increase significantly. If such incentives are not forthcoming,
companies will choose other regions.


Misconception 2 – Promoting
the semiconductor industry is too expensive
from an economic perspective:
When you look at the success story of Silicon
Saxony, you immediately understand that every
euro invested in this region has paid off. In the
greater Dresden area, more than 400 companies
are currently organized in the Silicon Saxony
network, providing a total of more than 30,000
jobs. The two recently published studies by IIT,
“Analysis and forecast of economic and regional
growth effects of the semiconductor ecosystem
in Saxony” and by ZVEI/PWC, “From chips to
opportunities – the importance and profitability of
microelectronics funding,” show that government aid pays for itself within approximately 10
years. One job created in the semiconductor
industry leads to five additional induced jobs in
related industries and trades. In addition to being
economically viable from a return perspective,
semiconductor plants are indispensable from a
technological sovereignty perspective.



Misconception 3 – Europe doesn’t need
3 nm technology:
Logic technologies with 3 nm structure size are
currently only manufactured by three companies
worldwide: Intel, Samsung, and TSMC. The structures are so small that they cannot be manufactured with conventional lithography machines,
requiring so-called extreme ultravilolet (EUV) technology. Since product development and mask
sets for 3 nm technologies are very expensive,
these factories can only manufacture extremely
high-volume products: chips for mobile phones,
PCs, and data center applications. No chips for
these applications are manufactured in Europe,
so one may question whether Europe needs a
3 nm factory. Several aspects must be considered here: (1) For technological sovereignty, it
would be beneficial if 3 nm nodes were also
manufactured in Europe – the end products
containing these chips are not currently manufactured in Europe, but are sold. It is possible that
chiplet technology will enable the manufacture of
3 nm chips based on the integration of chiplets
into a single chip – chiplet technologies could
be widely accepted in European user industries.
(2) Spillover effects: It can be assumed that the
establishment of a 3 nm factory in Germany
would have a technological spillover effect on the
entire semiconductor ecosystem. To the extent
that corresponding customer industries establish
themselves on the continent in the future, a
3 nm factory would be of outstanding interest
to Europe. A balance between supply and
demand is a crucial success factor. Even the
fact that Intel canceled the construction of the
3 nm factory due to company-specific issues
is not an argument against supporting a 3 nm
factory.


Misconception 4 – If you support
semiconductor factories, you also have
to subsidize many other industries –
there isn’t enough money:
The authors of this position paper do not believe
that economic success can only be achieved
with government subsidies. On the contrary, the
government should ensure favorable framework
conditions and, wherever possible, allow the
economy to function according to free market
mechanisms. Problems and conflicts arise when
there is a departure from free and fair competition, leading to market distortions – for example,
through massive and disproportionate subsidies



VDE Position Paper – Hidden Electronics IV 8


for individual industries in other parts of the world.
This is the case for the semiconductor industry
and certainly also for some other critical sectors.


Semiconductors are a basic product of almost all
modern technologies – from smartphones and
industrial equipment to medical technology and
vehicles. Innovations in the semiconductor sector
therefore have a multiplicative effect: Advances
in chips enable new functions, greater energy
efficiency, and improved security in all industries.
A high-performance, cost-effective, and trustworthy
chip supply from Europe directly strengthens the
competitiveness of European companies in sectors such as automotive, mechanical engineering,
telecommunications, energy, and healthcare.
Promoting microelectronics is therefore not only
relevant for sector policy, but also a strategic lever
for the entire European innovation landscape.



The consequence of not providing support would
simply be that chips would no longer be developed and produced in Europe. The last 25 years
have clearly demonstrated this. The big question
is why we should support microelectronics and
not other sectors, such as battery technology,
electric cars, solar cells, etc. Solar cells also
received massive government support in China,
thus displacing European manufacturers. The
difference between solar cells and semiconductors is that semiconductors are crucial to the
innovative capacity of the European economy.
Without semiconductors, there is a risk that
Europe will be left behind; without semiconductors, Europe’s technological sovereignty is at risk
in a whole range of critical technology areas.
While this argument may apply to other industries
as well, it does not change its relevance for the
semiconductor industry.


## 6. Fit for Future – recommendations for action



1. Strengthening the entire semiconductor
ecosystem in Europe:
Europe needs a strong semiconductor ecosystem across the entire value chain. A special
focus should be on manufacturing (including
testing) and design. On manufacturing, because Europe needs a stronger presence in
the supply of chips than it currently has – and
on design, because design accounts for the
highest share of value added, and Europe has
a lot of catching up to do in this area. Design
should not be neglected at the expense
of promoting production, and vice versa –
promoting design activities does not make
supporting manufacturing superfluous.


2. Strengthening chip design:
Germany represents a strong, attractive location for chip design. This is demonstrated by
the fact that non-European companies such
as Apple and Texas Instruments conduct significant chip design activities here. However,
the commercial EDA tools for chip design are
overwhelmingly developed in the USA, which
could pose a problem for Europe’s technological sovereignty. The aim here is to stimulate
and promote the development of a European
EDA industry. Another possible approach
could be to strengthen the development of
open-source design tools, which are currently



gaining increasing attention in Europe. An
initial encouraging example is provided in the
field of processor design by RISC-V. RISC-V
is an open and royalty-free instruction set architecture and enables players to develop and
distribute their own processors. Open-source
design tools will not be able to replace proprietary tools, but overall, there is certainly the
potential for Europe to become less dependent on the US and gain technological sovereignty by building an open-source ecosystem
in chip design. This would benefit the entire
European supply chain and reduce market
fragmentation and technological dependence
on third countries. The ability to openly develop and share hardware architectures would
also lower barriers to entry for new market
entrants and strengthen competitiveness.
Given the growing importance of edge AI and
high-performance computing, it is crucial for
Europe to play its own role in this area.


3. Strengthening strengths:
Funding must be channeled into European
semiconductor locations and the expansion
of infrastructure where Europe already has
strengths. Fears of free-rider effects are misplaced, as semiconductor manufacturers think
globally when expanding capacity and consider the overall framework. Funding alone is not



VDE Position Paper – Hidden Electronics IV 9


decisive; other important factors include (1) planning
security, (2) a good energy supply and low energy
prices, (3) a functioning administration without
excessive bureaucracy, (4) the availability of skilled
workers, (5) market access, and (6) the ecosystem.


4. Closing gaps:
Europe now has significant gaps in many areas
of the semiconductor value chain that need to
be closed. It is clear that this cannot be achieved
completely, but a start must be made. In this sense,
any company that establishes itself in areas where
Europe has lost its expertise should be strongly
supported.


5. Strengthening innovations:
The translation of excellent research into marketable
innovations takes place in both established industrial companies and start-ups. Europe has a lot of
catching up to do with the US, especially in the
area of startups. Activities to promote startups (e.g.,
_UnternehmerTUM_ in Munich or the nationwide incubators of the 6G hubs) must be further supported
and developed. Improving the availability of venture
capital is essential.


6. Identifying future markets:
Microelectronics regularly experiences new growth
spurts through new markets (in the past, for example, PCs and mobile telephony; currently, AI and
robotics). A systematic study (e.g., by acatech) of
potential future markets for microelectronics that are
attractive to Europe (e.g., robotics or personalized
medical technology) would provide appropriate
support for decision-making.


7. Benchmarking with other regions of the world:
In addition to the EU Chips Act, major funding programs have been launched in all regions relevant to
the semiconductor industry. With the Chips Act, the
US has initiated the construction of new factories
by Intel, TSMC, and other companies. Furthermore,
several global manufacturers have recently announced significant investments of their own in the
US. China has strengthened its own manufacturers,
such as SMIC and YMTC, through massive government support and reduced technological gaps.
South Korea and Japan are pursuing industrial policy strategies that promote both national champions
and international collaborations. For example, Japan
has begun a large-scale program for the development and production of 2 nm nodes (Rapidus).
To compete globally, Europe must therefore not only
measure itself against its own progress, but also
align itself with the speed and determination
of other regions.



8. Strengthening research:
For the future viability of microelectronics in Germany
and Europe, it is essential to maintain the current
momentum in the long term and to strengthen it in
individual areas. Areas where Europe already has
proven strengths, such as sensor technology and
power electronics, and those that are important
for technological sovereignty, such as quantum
technologies and IT security, are ideal. It will also
be important to further advance capabilities and
capacities in chip design. Likewise, the use of the
research capabilities developed in Germany in
semiconductor technology and hetero-integration
should be intensified for future innovations.


9. Attracting skilled workers:
Especially in the current geopolitical situation,
Europe can be very attractive for excellent skilled
workers. Outstanding researchers often serve as
focal points for both further skilled workers and
the founding of startups. A program for Humboldt
Professorships for microelectronics (such as the
2020-2024 program for AI) or ERC grants specifically
for microelectronics can be helpful in this regard.


10. Strengthening international partnerships:
A self-sufficient semiconductor ecosystem in
Europe would be a utopian ambition. Rather,
Europe should intensify partnerships to ensure
robust, transparent, and diversified supply chains
while securing skilled workers, critical raw materials,
and technological expertise. The focus should
therefore be on like-minded partner countries in the
APAC region (e.g., Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, India,
Vietnam) that possess complementary strengths,
growing markets, and technological competencies.
Targeted diversification and regionalization reduce
sectoral dependencies (friend-shoring), although
the costs of de-risking must always be considered.
Effective risk diversification requires a strategic,
focused, and market-oriented approach. Not every
region needs to cover all stages of the value chain

  - the key is to avoid one-sided, critical dependencies on individual players.
