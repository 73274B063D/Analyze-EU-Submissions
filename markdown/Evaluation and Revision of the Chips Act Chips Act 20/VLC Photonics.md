feedback: It will be very hard to have any leadership on fab front-end or back end
  at this late time, so while we maintain some basic level of sovereignity, we should
  focus in EU to drive and support the growth of companies making use of the current
  and foreign infrastructure that is being (over)built in these years, to become market
  leaders in their segments and make sure they export their technology, products and
  services to these other foreign countries.
