feedback: The next phase of the EU Chips Act should expand subsidized MPWs, and create
  EU-wide IC-design training and certification. We need more SME vouchers, a stronger
  push into 3D heterogeneous integration and chiplets. Europe must also invest in
  quantum sensing electronics, pan-EU testbeds, and coordinated collaboration to ensure
  real strategic autonomy. Finally, there is a need for long-term (10 year) stable
  funding to operate national nodes with these specializations.
