feedback: The electronics industry includes the whole supply chain from wafer to system.
  To achieve a basic level of autonomy for critical infrastructure in the EU it needs
  more than wafer fabs. Materials, printed circuit boards, advanced assembly lines
  are needed. The European equipment industry is in competition to suppliers from
  lower cost countries. To strengthen all parts of the supply chain EU equipment manufacturing
  is needed. So far there was no focus on the large number of innovative machine building
  companies. Funded fabs and pilot lines support existing manufacturers from outside
  Europe and do not foster innovation and strengthen the EU supplier base. In Chips
  Act 2 a focus on the value chain from wafer to system would be necessary. And a
  requirement to local sourcing of materials, PCBs and equipment would strengthen
  the European machine building base, create and secure jobs and reduce dependency
  on Asia for critical electronics. Viscom is a German machine building company for
  the electronics industry.
