feedback: Wacker Chemie from Germany, with its two polysilicon production sites in
  Germany, is Europes only manufacturer of polysilicon, and an essential player in
  Europes and the global semiconductor and solar supply chains. The Chips Act 2.0
  should build on Europe's existing technological leadership and recognize the crucial
  role of European semiconductor material suppliers, who have contributed to Europe's
  economic resilience and technological development to date. Europe is home to the
  world's leading producer of semiconductor polysilicon, which is the crucial starting
  point of the entire global semiconductor supply chain. Firstly, the Chips Act 2.0
  should reinforce the initiatives launched by the Clean Industrial Deal and its components,
  rather than being drafted in isolation. Other world regions have realized the importance
  of having their own semiconductor supply chains and have established dedicated industrial
  strategies with extensive financial support. In this highly competitive global landscape,
  the business conditions for energy-intensive European companies, such as polysilicon
  producers, remain extremely challenging. The EU Chips Act 2.0 should go beyond supporting
  semiconductor manufacturing alone and be extended to cover the entire value chain.
  This should include upstream activities such as the supply of raw materials (e.g.
  electronic-grade polysilicon), equipment and tool manufacturing, and downstream
  integration such as packaging, testing and system design. By addressing all critical
  stages, from materials and wafer production to advanced packaging and end-use applications,
  the Act can create a genuinely resilient and competitive ecosystem, reducing dependency
  on external suppliers and strengthening Europes technological sovereignty. Secondly,
  unrestricted access to silicon metal is of the utmost importance. Unwarranted EU
  import restrictions would unjustifiably increase domestic production costs for polysilicon.
  Thirdly, access to affordable/low carbon electricity with a long-term price predictability
  is needed for profitable and sustainable operations and products up to new investments
  in Europe.
