feedback: 'Water Europe (WE) supports the European Commissions evaluation of the EU
  Chips Act 2.0. Given the strategic role of semiconductors in Europes digitalisation,
  energy transition and industrial competitiveness, the revision of the Chips Act
  offers a unique opportunity to address all critical enablers of chip manufacturing.
  Yet, despite the recognised focus on energy efficiency and circularity, the current
  evaluation neglects water which is a fundamental resource of the value chain. Water
  is indispensable for semiconductor production. Today, the EU produces 3 million
  wafers per month, consuming 45 million m³ of freshwater - 15 m³ per 12-inch wafer.
  Advanced memory chips can require up to 21 litres of water per cm². Doubling production
  to 6 million wafers monthly by 2030 would raise water demand to between 72 and 108
  million m³ per month, a 60-140% increase. Fab processes require ultra-pure water
  (UPW), with each wafer being rinsed around 100 times. Producing 1 litre of UPW requires
  1.5 litres of freshwater, and impurities (even microscopic) can ruin chips and reduce
  yield. Water scarcity directly threatens manufacturing continuity. The 2021 Taiwanese
  drought forced major plants to limit operations, doubling global chip lead times
  and generating estimated EU-wide losses of around 27.5 million per month. At the
  same time, semiconductor production generates chemically loaded wastewater; by 2030,
  EU plants could discharge 1450 million m³ annually depending on recycling performance.
  Advanced water technologies therefore represent not only an environmental requirement
  but also a competitive lever. While global leaders recycle up to 86% of their process
  water, EU manufacturers average just 45%. Raising European recycling rates and deploying
  state-of-the-art purification solutions could reduce freshwater abstraction by 216
  million m³ yearly and generate savings exceeding 1 billion. Because semiconductor
  policy objectives directly depend on secure and efficient water use, the Chips Act
  must explicitly integrate water management into its strategic framework, in line
  with the objective to build a water-smart economy. Achieving leading-edge manufacturing
  (sub-10nm) will require more sophisticated UPW systems. Improving Europes competitiveness
  hinges on reducing environmental and operational costs through advanced water reuse,
  while supply chain resilience cannot be ensured without assessing water availability
  and treatment capacity. Water Europe recommends: 1.Recognise water infrastructure
  and technologies as essential enablers, and water companies as partners in EU policy-making,
  for achieving EU semiconductor production goals and strategic autonomy. 2.Enable
  access to Chips Act funding for water purification, recycling, and wastewater treatment
  infrastructure specifically tailored to semiconductor manufacturing requirements.
  3.Promote adoption of advanced water management technologies, best practices, guidelines
  and common water performance indicators to improve competitiveness, circularity
  and water efficiency in semiconductor production. 4.Integrate considerations on
  water resources in supply chain resilience assessments and permit requirements for
  semiconductor production. 5.Support partnerships and knowledge exchange platforms
  between semiconductor manufacturers, water technology providers, and regional water
  authorities to address water challenges. Water security is a structural pillar of
  semiconductor manufacturing . To build a resilient, competitive and sustainable
  chip ecosystem, the EU Chips Act 2.0 must embed water at its core.'

### Integrating Water Management into the EU Chips Act 2.0

#### @


Water Europe (WE) is the recognized voice and promotor of water-related innovation, research, and technology development
in Europe. WE is a purpose-driven multi-stakeholder association with over 300 members, representing the entire range of
actors in the innovative water ecosystem. WE was established by the European Commission as a European Technology
Platform. WE is guided in all its activities by its Water Vision, with the ultimate ambition of achieving a Water-Smart Society.

## No Chips Without Water

INTEGRATING WATER MANAGEMENT INTO THE UE
CHIPS ACT 2.0


Water Europe supports the European Commission’s initiative to evaluate the EU
Chips Act, given the strategic importance of semiconductors for Europe's digital and
green transitions. Semiconductors are essential components in technologies
ranging from electric vehicles and renewable energy systems to artificial
intelligence, data centres, and advanced manufacturing, making them indispensable
for the EU’s economic competitiveness.


This evaluation provides a crucial opportunity to ensure the legislation remains fit
for purpose and addresses all critical enablers of semiconductor manufacturing in
line with the objectives of the Water Resilience Strategy to build a Water-Smart
Economy.


## **Introduction**

The legislation and call for evidence rightly
acknowledge the importance of improving energy
efficiency and enabling greater circularity in
semiconductor production to support
environmentally sustainable manufacturing.
However, Water Europe regrets the notable absence
of water considerations among the priorities for
evaluation, and potential revision, announced by the
European Commission, considering the new [Water](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=celex:52025DC0280)
[Resilience Strategy](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=celex:52025DC0280) and its objective to strengthen the
competitiveness and the security of the European
economic activities by building a Water-Smart
Economy.

[As documented in our detailed study “Socio-](https://watereurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Water-Europe-Socio-Economic-Study-1.pdf)

[water”, water management and water technologies](https://watereurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Water-Europe-Socio-Economic-Study-1.pdf)
are critical for semiconductor manufacturing and
should be prioritised alongside energy and as part of
circularity considerations. The study's research
reveals the following:



1. **High water footprint**



Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely
water-intensive. The EU's current production
of 3 million wafers per month consumes 45
million m³ of fresh water monthly (15 m³ per
12-inch wafer). For advanced memory chips,
water consumption can reach 21 litres per
cm² of wafer. Achieving the EU's goal of
doubling production to 6 million wafers per
month by 2030 will require between 72 and
108 million m³ of water monthly, a 60-140%
increase from current levels.

2. **Ultra-pure water quality requirement**



litre of ultra-pure water, and the more advanced
the chip process, the purer the water must be. Even
trace impurities can damage delicate
semiconductor circuits and reduce production
yields.

3. **Water scarcity risks**

Water shortages or supply disruptions can force
semiconductor plants to halt operations. The 2021
Taiwan drought demonstrated this vulnerability,
doubling global semiconductor lead times from 10
to 21 weeks, with estimated EU losses of
approximately €27.5 million per month in
economic profit.

4. **Environmental compliance**

Proper wastewater treatment is essential for
semiconductor facilities to meet environmental
regulations. The manufacturing process generates
highly contaminated wastewater containing
chemicals and heavy metals, with EU production
projected to discharge between 14 and 50 million
m³ annually by 2030, depending on recycling rates.


5. **Competitive advantage**

Advanced water management technologies can
significantly reduce operational costs and improve
sustainability. EU semiconductor manufacturers
currently recycle on average 45% of water
compared to 86% achieved by global leaders.
Improving recycling rates and adopting advanced
purification technologies could save over €1 billion
annually in operational costs while reducing
freshwater consumption by 216 million m³ per
year.



Chip fabrication demands water of very high
purity, with each wafer being rinsed
approximately 100 times during production. It
takes 1.5 litres of fresh water to produce 1

 - **Securing manufacturing of leading-edge**
**chips (sub-10nm):** Advanced semiconductor
nodes below 10nm require higher water purity
and greater water consumption. Developing
the EU's manufacturing capacity for these
strategic chips will require advanced water

- **Ensuring supply chain resilience:** Water
availability represents a critical but
overlooked vulnerability in semiconductor
supply chains. Comprehensive resilience
