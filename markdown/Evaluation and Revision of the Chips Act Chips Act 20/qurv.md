feedback: My feedback reflects the perspective of a semiconductor start-up developing
  wide-spectrum image sensors for high-volume computer-vision applications. Our work
  focuses primarily on groundbreaking process technologies based on novel quantum
  materials. While the Chips Act is an important and timely initiative, it appears
  to be oriented mainly toward large companies and academic institutions. Historically,
  SMEs have played a crucial role in the European semiconductor and deep-tech landscape,
  yet their needs seem insufficiently considered in the design of current funding
  schemes. In my view, Europe will capture the greatest future value by investing
  in genuinely groundbreaking technologies. Part of that investment should indeed
  support academia and research institutes, but start-ups and spin-offs are equally
  vital. They are the engines that translate scientific breakthroughs into market-ready
  technologies. The Chips Act starts now supporting design-focused start-ups, while
  those working on novel process technologiessuch as ours do not seem to be taken
  into account when evaluating the current and future relevant funding instruments.
  In our specific case, no suitable calls for collaborative projects were available.
  The EIC Accelerator call for semiconductor technologies opened only once, and unfortunately
  at a time when we were not yet ready to apply. We believe this represents a missed
  opportunity, especially at a moment when technological sovereignty is so critical
  for Europe. Designers can be attracted abroad relatively easily. In contrast, infrastructure,
  process know-how, and manufacturing capabilities rooted in Europe are far harder
  to relocate. Europe does not need to compete exclusively on the most advanced CMOS
  nodes. Instead, it should invest now in diverse, innovative process technologies
  that will form the foundation of tomorrows semiconductor landscape. One of the most
  effective ways to do this is by supporting start-ups and spin-offs working on disruptive
  process technologies.
