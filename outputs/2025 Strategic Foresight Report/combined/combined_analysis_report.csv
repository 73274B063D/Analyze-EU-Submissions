Each urges more active public intervention and enforcement to limit harms caused by unregulated markets and to ensure basic wellbeing (housing, energy, health) is safeguarded.","Submission B prioritises a clearly anti‑neoliberal stance: direct market constraints and stronger state intervention in basic goods (housing, food, energy) to curb capitalist excesses. Submission A focuses on technological and strategic resilience (AI, biotech, climate interventions, defence, procurement reform and public‑private R&D), favouring targeted innovation policy and market‑leveraging instruments alongside regulation — creating tension between B’s market‑restriction approach and A’s emphasis on using market/finance tools to drive innovation and strategic autonomy."

The municipal-contribution prescription raises concerns about local fiscal burden, accountability, and distributive fairness that are not addressed by the flat levy proposal."
