    "feedback": "Open hardware (specifications, designs, and code) is a foundation of semiconductor knowledge that is guaranteed to be available for any purpose. It can be used as-is for fabricating chips in the EU. It can also be modified to match the various semiconductor needs of the EU, or to optimise production based on the raw materials available or other constraints. The EU is already using open hardware in some situations to increase resilience, foster innovation, and provide multiple economic benefits, but there are many more opportunities that are not yet being used. We thank the European Commission for this opportunity to participate in the revision of the Chips Act. Below are our recommendations for how to achieve the Act's goals.

    "feedback": "The electronics industry includes the whole supply chain from wafer to system. To achieve a basic level of autonomy for critical infrastructure in the EU it needs more than wafer fabs. Materials, printed circuit boards, advanced assembly lines are needed. The European equipment industry is in competition to suppliers from lower cost countries. To strengthen all parts of the supply chain EU equipment manufacturing is needed. So far there was no focus on the large number of innovative machine building companies. Funded fabs and pilot lines support existing manufacturers from outside Europe and do not foster innovation and strengthen the EU supplier base. In Chips Act 2 a focus on the value chain from wafer to system would be necessary. And a requirement to local sourcing of materials, PCBs and equipment would strengthen the European machine building base, create and secure jobs and reduce dependency on Asia for critical electronics.

    "feedback": "CONNECT is the Research Ireland Centre for Future Networks and Communications, Irelands national inter-university research initiative in 6G networks co-funded by Research Ireland, Horizon Europe, and industry with no dominant partner. Our scope extends from the physical (wireless/optical) layer through the stack of control and application layers, to socio-economic aspects of network deployment, sustainability, resilience, and security. Networks are of strategic importance to Europes resilience, competitiveness, and technological sovereignty, depend on chips, and so are relevant to the European Chips Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/1781). Silicon supply chain fragilities are well known. Europe is overdependent on major Asian foundries, with high minimum order quantities and long lead time. High end CMOS chips can be and are made in the EU. Compound semiconductors are critical importance to networks, are. Networks depend on specialist semiconductor products including, among others, radiofrequency circuits, power amplifiers, optoelectronic chips (telecoms wavelength lasers), pump lasers for optical amplifiers, using the physics of direct bandgap (compound) semiconductors, epitaxially grown layer by layer as engineered device material on a wafer, which is then fabricated into chips. Europe must have a sovereign supply chain of epitaxial device material wafers with device fabrication and packaging materials to produce components. Optoelectronic device packaging, and rf device packaging, are also specialist niches, as is the fabrication and packaging of antennae, today complex devices extending to reconfigurable MIMO devices and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). Printed and additive electronics are critical for future sustainable manufacture of sensors and antennae and should come within the scope of the Chips Act. The Airbus Industrie model created a rival to Boeing, by organising a sovereign European supply chain from the diversity of European industry. This model could create a European hyperscale network operator of scale. It could also marshal our chip fabrication capabilities, especially in niche sectors, to create a European capability to rival TSMC and other large players, to give Europe scale in the notoriously fragmented compound semiconductor device market, and to ensure European design and manufacturing capability of key enabling chip classes, especially graphics processing units (GPU) which have critical non-graphics applications in AI. A dirigiste approach, and the powers to make such market intervention and organisation, especially in a supply chain emergency, will be required to lead and direct such an enterprise. We refer to the below evidence which should be considered in framing the next generation Chips Act. The 6G Industry Association (6G-IA): Key Strategies for 6G Smart Networks and Services; June 2023, addresses: 6G Technological Sovereignty (a) components and microelectronics, b) open SNS solutions, c) cloudification and distributed computing, d) network intelligence, e) security and privacy and f) knowledge base); and Sustainability (all aspects of environmental, societal and economic sustainability). Section 2.1 identifies Components and Micro-Electronics, as one of six key Smart Networks and Services technologies. (attached) The 6G Flagship 6G Resilience White Paper 6G Research Visions, No. 15 Nov 2025 (https://oulurepo.oulu.fi/handle/10024/59226) (27Mb), focuses on network resilience and the strategic autonomy of Europe including the development and maintenance of capabilities (knowledge and skills) and capacities (production, manufacturing, and services) control over these assets, enabling a nation to independently determine and execute its future trajectory in the domains of economy, society, and democracy, and proposes strategic capitalism active government intervention in the economy to boost specific industries (p44) and digital supply chain and the Chips Act (p48)",

    "feedback": "Qualcomm welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the European Commissions Call for Evidence on the review of the Chips Act and supports the development of a more ambitious, innovation-driven Chips Act 2. The current Chips Act mobilized political attention and major investment, establishing semiconductors as a strategic priority for Europe. Yet implementation has revealed structural limitations that have to be addressed to strengthen Europes competitiveness, resilience, and technological sovereignty. The current focus on reaching 20% global manufacturing capacity by 2030 has generated momentum but is unlikely to be met. Therefore, Europe should therefore complement production goals with innovation-oriented indicators, including design capability, R&D intensity, advanced packaging, IP generation, skilled workforce development, and leadership in AI, 5G/6G, edge computing and energy-efficient low-power processing. A key limitation of the existing framework is its emphasis on large-scale fabs. Europe has under-supported vital segments such as chip design, IP, EDA tools, advanced packaging, materials, equipment, and fabless companies. These areas are essential for technological sovereignty and represent domains where Europe can achieve global leadership. SMEs and start-ups, which drive much of semiconductor design innovation, face administrative barriers and limited access to funding and foundry capacity. Chips Act 2 should therefore broaden eligibility, simplify procedures, and ensure predictable access to manufacturing through structured public-private partnerships. To remain competitive, Europe must also address structural enablers: deployment of skilled engineers, affordable clean energy, reliable water, and critical raw materials. A dedicated European semiconductor skills programme is needed, including investment in STEM education, international mobility schemes, and collaborative research exchanges with trusted industrial partners. Stronger governance and coordination are essential for efficiency and impact. The role of the European Semiconductor Board should be reinforced, enabling it to coordinate strategy, permitting, and funding at EU level. A one-stop-shop for project approval would reduce fragmentation and increase legal certainty. Greater transparency of funding flows and outcomes is necessary to avoid duplication and ensure effective allocation of public resources. Qualcomm emphasizes the strategic importance of strengthening European chip design capabilities. Supporting open and secure design frameworks, including the RISC-V instruction set architecture, can reduce dependency on proprietary technologies and stimulate innovation, particularly in automotive, industrial, robotics, AI, and edge applications. Chips Act 2 should be integrated with Europes broader digital and industrial strategies, including AI, advanced connectivity, quantum technologies, sustainable digitalization and the green transition. Semiconductors underpin Europes ability to lead in these domains. A more holistic approach linking research, design, industrial deployment and cross-sector application would create stronger synergies and reinforce Europes global position. Qualcomm supports the strategic objectives set out by the Semicon Coalitionprosperity, indispensability, and resilienceand the alignment of national initiatives with EU-level instruments. Europe should measure success not only through manufacturing share, but through leadership in design, IP, specialized technologies, trusted supply chains, and sustainable semiconductor development. A future-proof Chips Act 2 should create a coherent, innovation-centred policy architecture that strengthens Europes position across the full semiconductor value chainfrom conception and design to deploymentwhile fostering open standards, trusted partnerships and long-term competitiveness.",

To ensure effective participation, new calls should not be introduced as amendments to annual work programmes during the year. National budget processes are inherently slow, and when national funding is unavailable, relevant national actors are prevented from participating. ----2) Chips Competence Centres: Objectives and Challenges: The primary objective of Chips Competence Centres is to build expertise and support SMEs in utilizing pilot lines, design platforms, and related chips technologies. However, current State-aid rules restrict the transfer of competence from the Competence Centres to third-party SMEs. ----3) Pre-Commercial Procurement for Pilot Lines: Chips JU should consider implementing Pre-Commercial Procurement for acquiring semiconductor manufacturing equipment for pilot lines. Europe already has significant strengths in this area and supporting SMEs with new technologies as they approach market entry is crucial for maintaining competitiveness. ----4) Norway's Participation and Eligibility in Chips JU Calls: Norway is associated with the Horizon Europe and Digital programmes and is an EEA-EFTA country. It is important to ensure that Norwegian actors are eligible in all future Chips JU calls. ----5) Marked pull initiatives: While Chips Act 1.0 has commendably focused on the development of technology and infrastructure for pilot lines without having a clear strategy on their commercial use, we believe that to truly maximize the benefits of this investment, Chips Act 2.0 should introduce demand driven market pull initiatives. By introducing demand-driven market pull initiatives, Europe can not only strengthen its existing industrial base but also enhance its global competitiveness. This approach will stimulate innovation and drive the commercial application of new technologies, ensuring that investments result in tangible economic benefits both within Europe and in international markets.",

    "feedback": "The documents present coordinated feedback from the Spanish semiconductor ecosystem for the revision of the Chips Act 2.0. The main message is the need for a more operational, flexible, and industry-aligned framework that accelerates design, prototyping, manufacturing access, and market deployment. The ecosystem stresses that Europe must strengthen the fabless model, which represents most Spanish companies, by improving access to open EDA tools, shared tape-outs, certification support, and private-public financing instruments. Existing aid schemes are viewed as too rigid, slow, and uneven across Member States; the proposal calls for simpler procedures, predictable deadlines, direct support to design centers and equipment suppliers, and a sovereignty seal to fast-track strategic projects. Talent is described as one of the biggest bottlenecks, requiring a European micro-credential system, mobility programs, and coordinated training pathways. The documents also insist on better alignment between the Chips Act and the Critical Raw Materials Act, recognizing gases, chemicals, and equipment suppliers as priority actors. Demand-side incentives are considered essential to create scale, especially in automotive, energy, defense, telecom, and health. The annex provides sector-specific recommendations: in telecoms, advancing RF, chiplets, and 5G/6G SoCs; in defense and space, secure and radiation-resistant chips and flexible Lab-to-Fab prototyping; in AI hardware, promoting RISC-V, neuromorphic systems, open design, and green chips; in photonics, positioning it as a strategic enabling technology with shared pilot lines; in materials, boosting European production of chemicals, 2D materials, and equipment, and promoting circularity; in automotive, validating EU-made chips and integrating European sensors; and in energy, supporting SiC/GaN, efficient power conversion chips, and greener manufacturing. Overall, the feedback emphasizes practical mechanisms, stronger governance with industry participation, and the need to turn strategic priorities into concrete, enforceable operational tools.",

    "feedback": "Quintauris is a joint venture dedicated to advancing the adoption of RISC-V globally by enabling next-generation hardware development. The company focuses on accelerating commercialization of RISC-V products, providing reference architectures, and supporting solutions used in industries, with an initial focus on automotive. Europes semiconductor industry underpins technologies from embedded systems in household appliances and medical devices to high-performance computing. Despite progress under the European Chips Act, Europes global share remains at eight percent, far below the twenty percent target. Chips Act 2 must go beyond large-scale investments and focus on enabling innovation to reach the market. To achieve technological sovereignty, Europe should strengthen strategic capabilities rather than attempt to duplicate the entire supply chain. Key priorities include securing architecture sovereignty through RISC-V, leveraging Europes strong position in microcontrollers and application industries, and fostering collaboration between semiconductor and application sectors. Startups and SMEs are critical drivers of innovation but face barriers in current funding models. Chips Act 2 should introduce agile, milestone-based funding structures that align with product roadmaps and reduce administrative burdens. Investments should target areas where Europe can lead, such as RISC-V platforms, microcontrollers, and power electronics, while diversifying across smaller projects to spread risk. By focusing on strategic capabilities, supporting startups, and ensuring application-driven adoption, Chips Act 2 can accelerate Europe toward its twenty percent global share target and secure technological sovereignty.",

    "feedback": "Europes semiconductor strategy must avoid the risk of directing most public funding toward large industrial actors while neglecting the foundational layers of the ecosystem, i.e. design tools, early-stage research infrastructure, and the skills pipeline. Providing funds to industry without strengthening the toolchain is dangerous, especially considering that nearly all critical Electronic Design Automation (EDA), verification, and cloud-based design environments are controlled by non-EU companies. If Europe rebuilds manufacturing capacity on top of external, licensed, and often opaque toolflows, it will remain strategically dependent even after investing billions in fabrication capacity. The chips ecosystem also needs greater diversity across application domains. Current policy often emphasises automotive, industrial controllers, or legacy embedded markets, but long-term competitiveness requires support for specialised chips in areas where Europe already has strong scientific and industrial depth, such as edge AI, telecommunications, biomedical systems, secure IoT, and energy-efficient AI accelerators. A crucial part of enabling this diversification is strengthening rapid prototyping and early-stage technology evaluation before fabrication. Academic research can make major contributions here yet is currently under supported. In parallel, hardware security must be elevated to a core objective of the Chips Act. The frequency of hardware-level attacks, trojans, and supply-chain compromises is rising sharply, and modern systems depend on secure-by-design components at all abstraction levels, from circuits to packaging to system integration. Without substantial investment in research on hardware assurance, open and transparent verification platforms, security-oriented design methodologies, and trusted test infrastructures, Europe risks creating advanced chipmaking capacity that is still vulnerable to manipulation, counterfeits, and external control points embedded in the toolchain. Finally, true security of supply cannot be achieved through factories alone. A resilient semiconductor ecosystem requires sovereign capability in design, modelling, verification, packaging, testing, and system-level integration. Strengthening shared research facilities, open-source tool development, and training programmes will ensure that European engineers, SMEs, and universities can participate in the full semiconductor value chain. Balancing industrial subsidies with investments in tools, talent, and hardware security is the only sustainable path to real technological sovereignty and long-term supply-chain resilience for Europe.",

    "feedback": "ASP Equipment GmbH is a medium sized OEM, we develop and manufacture power supplies for satellites and other spacecraft. We are the national leading supplier for Power Electronics for Spacecraft and Launchers. In some areas, we heavily depend on very few, sometimes single sources for materials and EEE parts which cannot be procured from the European continent. For use in space, both electronical components and materials must withstand extreme temperatures, X-radiation and straying ions. This requires not only a very specialized design, but as well extremely resilient and mechanically robust semiconductors. Very recently, the European countries agreed on considerable budget increases for the space industry. Furthermore, national space budgets for defence continue to rise significantly every year. Although we operate in a niche market, it is growing steadily and has now reached a considerable volume. A significant proportion of this volume goes to manufacturers of electronic components. Ancient components are often used because there are no modern alternatives. The Chips Act 2 must encourage companies with its initiatives to develop alternative and innovative products for our large niche to create independence. Smaller companies and start-ups in particular need support, as the rules are complicated and qualifications require long term investments. Furthermore, it is important to keep the big picture in mind: a component is only functional in an assembled printed circuit board. We must ensure that the European PCB industry will not slip into insignificance.",

Semiconductors underpin critical technologies such as AI, quantum, automotive, energy systems, defence, and high-performance computing, and Europes current manufacturing capacity and fragmented demand create strategic vulnerabilities. KTH highlights that achieving technological sovereignty requires more than leading-edge fabs. Europe needs coordinated industrial demand, long-term investment in low-TRL frontier research, cross-disciplinary collaboration in areas such as materials, chip design, photonics, packaging, and power electronics, as well as flexible pilot lines and first-of-a-kind production facilities. KTH underscores Europes strong position in essential semiconductor domainspower electronics, photonics, sensors, and microcontrollersand calls for sustained funding, research infrastructures, and strengthened academicindustry collaboration to maintain and expand this leadership. A major challenge is the severe semiconductor skills gap. KTH calls for expanded education, coordinated European training initiatives, industry partnerships, and talent-attraction measures to ensure a skilled workforce across design, manufacturing, testing, and emerging areas such as AI-hardware. KTH also stresses the need for long-term stability in research funding, sustainable and energy-efficient semiconductor production, accessible infrastructures for SMEs and startups, and a balanced approach to security and international collaboration. Overall, KTH supports the Commissions forward-looking vision and commits to contributing through its research facilities, participation in pilot lines, skills development initiatives, and collaborations with industry and SMEshelping ensure Europes semiconductor ambitions translate into tangible capability, competitiveness, and resilience.",

    "feedback": "Europe's semiconductor strategy should shift from pursuing manufacturing autonomy to becoming an irreplaceable partner in the global value chain. The 2023 Act's ambition to reach 20% of global chip production was a reasonable response to the supply chain disruptions of 2020-2022, but the threat landscape has fundamentally changed. With targets increasingly out of reach and the required investment prohibitively large, Europe cannot win a subsidy race against the US and China. More importantly, chip access is now threatened predominantly by deliberate geopolitical restrictions rather than accidental disruptions. A strategy built around manufacturing capacity cannot address a world where semiconductors have become instruments of economic leverage. Europe must adapt accordingly. Strategic indispensability offers a more effective path. Europe already holds critical chokepoints in the global supply chain. By ensuring the global supply chain remains dependent on European technology, the EU ensures that partners and rivals alike have a strategic interest in maintaining Europe's access to their chipssecuring access to all advanced chip types, not just those a European fab might produce. Achieving this requires three reinforcing capabilities: comprehensive dependency mapping, targeted investment in high-leverage technologies, and stronger coordination for a credible European response when chip access is threatened. These efforts will be more likely to succeed if embedded within the broader competitiveness reforms recommended in the Draghi and Letta reports, from capital-market integration to regulatory reform. I. Better Situational Awareness. The Commission should map bidirectional dependencies, identifying not only where Europe is vulnerable, but also where the global supply chain depends on European technology. This requires mandatory data provision from key market actors and greatly increased technical capacity at the Commission. II. Clearer Strategy. Replace the 20% volume target with a strategic portfolio approach: protect existing strengths in lithography equipment (ASML), precision optics (Zeiss), and research infrastructure (imec); back emerging technologies where Europe can establish future leverage; and reduce critical dependencies selectively, focusing on automotive and edge inference chips rather than comprehensive manufacturing autonomy. The revised Act should establish a Strategic Semiconductor Asset designation for entities at critical chokepoints, triggering tailored support including extended state-aid flexibility, STEP integration, fast-track permitting, and streamlined communication with the Commission. III. Stronger Coordination. Europe's fragmented export control governance leaves individual Member States vulnerable to external pressure. The revised Act should coordinate export control decisions at EU level and develop a calibrated response framework; a menu of retaliatory measures that Europe could deploy if third countries restrict Europes access to chips. This provides credible deterrence without immediate escalation. The revised Act should also establish a streamlined response mechanism with pre-approved triggers, accelerated timelines, and a solidarity fund for companies affected by export controls.",

    "feedback": "The EU Chips Act 2.0 offers the opportunity for a decisive turning point in the European semiconductor industry and technology policy. While the first Chips Act focused primarily on resilience and security of supply at a time of acute supply bottlenecks, Europe now needs a semiconductor policy that focuses on technological leadership, competitive strength, and indispensability in the value chain through innovative power. The focus must shift from reactive crisis management to a long-term location strategy. The revision of the EU Chips Act offers a unique opportunity to secure Europe's technological sovereignty, economic resilience, and industrial competitiveness. Europe has outstanding research, strong user industries, and clusters, but it lacks speed, coordina-tion, and investment momentum. Other regions of the world are acting more strategically and cohesively, while European procedures are still too fragmented and bureaucratic. The Chips Act 2.0 must draw conclusions from this: less complexity, more impact. An industrial policy approach that views research, development, and manufacturing as an integrated value chain is crucial. Taking into account the budget situation and priorities in financial planning, public funding should be targeted at areas where Europe can build indispensable competencies and receive the right impetus with the help of this funding. These include, above all, areas such as power semiconductors, chip design, AI and quantum chips, and future technologies such as Edge AI. The strong supply industry is also a key success factor for the European semiconductor ecosystem. In addition, the future technology of photonics should be highlighted as a strategically relevant field. At the same time, it is important to accelerate knowledge transfer between research and industry and to integrate start-ups and SMEs into the innovation ecosystem. European semiconductor policy must not isolate itself in this regard. Resilience comes from international networking with trustworthy partners, not from isolation. Strategic cooperation with countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Singapore can stabilize supply chains, create common standards, and secure access to technologies. Equally important is strengthening the conditions in Europe: competitive energy prices, reliable framework conditions, modern infrastructure, reliable access to critical raw materials, and a determined reduction of regulatory hurdles. The EU Chips Act 2.0 can only be successful if, at the same time, the conditions mentioned above are significantly improved. The Chips Act 2.0 can only be effective if the industry is able to help shape it as a partner. What Europe needs now is a clear strategic vision that recognizes semiconductors as a crucial factor in the resilience of the economy, society, and technological sovereignty, and that consistently anchors the aforementioned principles in its implementation.",

    "feedback": "Europes semiconductor future depends on a stronger, more accessible and geographically balanced innovation ecosystem. Chips Act 2.0 must lower barriers for SMEs, reinforce Europes strengths in specialized technologies, and build true supply-chain resilience across all Member States not only regions with existing mega-fabs. 1. Enabling an Accessible, Pan-European Semiconductor Ecosystem for SMEs SMEs, design houses, research labs, and fabless startups represent much of Europes innovation capacity but face high entry barriers: costly design tools, limited MPW access, insufficient packaging/test infrastructure, and fragmented support. HETiA recommends that Chips Act 2.0: Build shared European design infrastructure with subsidized access to EDA tools, IP libraries, secure cloud environments, and training. Expand affordable MPW shuttles across FD-SOI, mixed-signal, Si Photonics, power, sensors, and emerging materials. Create open pilot lines for advanced packaging (2.5D/3D), photonics, reliability testing, and small-batch specialty manufacturing accessible to SMEs. Provide dedicated instruments for SME-led design, silicon IP, chiplets, and system-integration innovation not only large-scale fabs. Support cross-border SME consortia and empower national associations (like HETiA) to channel access, collaboration, and talent development. This broadens participation and activates innovation capacity across Europe. 2. Strengthening Europes Leadership in Niche, High-Value Semiconductor Segments Europes strongest competitive position lies in specialized domains with high strategic impact and manageable capital requirements. These technologies feed directly into defense, aerospace, medical systems, civil protection, sustainability, and agrifoodwhere autonomy is essential. Chips Act 2.0 should ensure inclusive access to IPCEI AST, allowing smaller Member States and SME-heavy ecosystems to participate in coordinated programs rather than concentrating benefits in existing hubs. HETiA identifies the following priority areas: Sensors, THz/mmWave and advanced imaging for automation, aerospace, defense, environment, and industry. Analog, mixed-signal and low-power architectures for secure edge AI and fabless innovation. Photonics and Si Photonics for telecom, LiDAR, quantum and secure communications. Power electronics and wide-bandgap devices (SiC, GaN, diamond) for mobility, decarbonization and energy resilience. Chiplet-based modular architectures built on sovereign European IP for high-impact verticals. Targeted support here accelerates commercialization and strengthens strategic autonomy. 3. Achieving Real Supply-Chain Resilience Through Geographic Diversification A resilient semiconductor Europe must be geographically diversified and structurally connected linking design, IP creation, embedded software, fabless startups, specialty manufacturing and advanced packaging. Sovereignty cannot rely on fabs alone; it requires integrated value chains that guarantee sell-through into strategic domains such as defense, aerospace, medicine, civil protection, sustainability and agrifood. Chips Act 2.0 should adopt a resilience model that includes smaller Member States in IPCEI AST, enabling them to contribute design, specialized processing and domain-specific innovation. These ecosystems often deliver agility, secure subsystems and niche production where innovation cycles are faster. HETiA recommends that Chips Act 2.0: Incentivize geographically distributed capacities in design, prototyping, packaging, photonics, sensors and reliability/test. Recognize smaller Member States as essential contributors to resilience and early-stage innovation. Embed redundancy, sovereign IP creation and cross-border complementarity into funding criteria. Promote coordinated national strategies focused on specialization, not fragmentation.",

    "feedback": "A broadened scope beyond the current logic centric Chips Act would allow other semiconductor technologies to benefit from incentives and create a more complete European ecosystem. Today, the Act focuses primarily on advanced logic nodes leaving critical gaps in areas where Europe has strong research capabilities and strategic needs. Expanding the scope would strengthen resilience and reduce dependency on non-European suppliers. Examples of additional areas include advanced display technologies such as MicroLEDs and AR/VR which are essential for next generation automotive, medical and immersive applications. Without targeted support, Europe risks losing ground to Asia where aggressive national strategies are accelerating commercialization. Optical interconnects for AI servers represent another key area enabling ultra-high bandwidth and low latency while reducing energy consumption in data centers which is a priority as AI workloads grow. Sensing technologies are equally important for automotive safety, industrial automation and healthcare. Wide bandgap materials (WBG) such as SiC and GaN are crucial for power electronics in electric vehicles, renewable energy systems and RF applications for telecom. These materials enable higher efficiency and lower energy loss, thus directly supporting EU climate targets. Both microLEDs and WBG materials support the Green Deal. Additionally, equipment manufacturing such as epitaxy reactors and laser transfer systems must be developed within Europe to reduce dependency on foreign toolmakers and secure supply chains. Incentives in these areas will unlock high value applications aligned with EU digital and green transition goals. MicroLEDs offer low power consumption and long lifespan supporting sustainability and energy efficiency. Wide bandgap semiconductors are indispensable for EV fast charging renewable energy integration and telecom infrastructure. Domestic equipment capability ensures Europe can maintain autonomy in critical manufacturing processes. A Chips Act 2.0 should include strategies directed at specific technology areas where European research is at the forefront. Taiwans action plan for display technologies provides a strong role model demonstrating how targeted policies accelerate commercialization. Public procurement mandates should be employed to create demand for European components in EU funded projects, particularly for the defense industry where independent supply chains are critical. Incentives for large enterprises to source components from European SMEs will help create an environment where the transition from mainly VC-funded to mainly-revenue funded models becomes easier. To build on Europes semiconductor start-up base, effective piloting services must be available for SMEs to encourage scaling within the EU. Cost barriers for access to shared cleanrooms and bonding facilities should be reduced. Programs focusing on the transition from lab-to-fab to reach volume production need to be prioritized, including display technologies. Funding for yield optimization during the scaling phase can bridge the gap between a first launch of an MVP and commercial scale production. Finally, specialized pan-European training programs for new talent and reskilling are necessary to address skill shortages. Funding options at the EU level without mandatory national co-funding should be created to ensure broader participation and faster deployment. The here listed actions and programs would greatly improve the likelihood of successfully taking the excellent European research to commercialization, something that today is a major weakness in Europe compared to Asian and American ecosystems.",

The submission addresses the three issues highlighted in the Call for Evidence: The EUs persistent dependence on non-EU suppliers for sub-10 nm chips; The erosion of Europes competitive edge in essential and mainstream semiconductors; The limited visibility over the resilience and vulnerabilities of the semiconductor ecosystem. Our analysis aims to support a forward-looking policy debate by identifying institutional, economic, and governance gaps that hinder the effective implementation of the Chips Act and by outlining evidence-based options to strengthen the framework. In evaluating the Commissions policy options, the CDS identifies targeted amendments to the Chips Act (Option 2) as the more effective and strategically coherent avenue for addressing Europes structural vulnerabilities. In its conclusions, the CDS recommends: Designing targeted instruments to secure EUs access to leading edge chips for strategic sectors and participation in their manufacturing while safeguarding competition and innovation; Reinforcing long-term support for Europes competitive strengths in essential and mainstream semiconductors; Establishing a structured, proportionate, and enforceable EU-level data gathering framework, integrated with Member State and selected firm-level reporting to improve ecosystem mapping and risk assessment.",

    "feedback": "CLEPA welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the review of the European Chips Act. While the Chips Act represents an important step forward, several gaps remain in bridging the distance between research and industrial deployment, strengthening backend manufacturing capabilities, and enabling a complete, efficient value chain that reflects the needs of Europes automotive and industrial ecosystems. Pillar I The Chips for Europe Initiative Pillar I provides important research capabilities, but it does not yet generate the support required for the technologies and developments needed to enable industrial-scale deployment for the automotive industry. At present, no clear pipeline exists between what is developed in Pillar I and what should be manufactured in future European facilities. To be effective, Pillar I must translate development programmes into producible technologies and directly address the requirements of European downstream industries as the automotive industry. The Chips Act 2 and its research and development arm should be designed with end-user needs in mind and must contribute to future capacity guarantees, helping to correct the current imbalance between strong European automotive demand and limited regional production options. Pillar II Security of supply and resilience Pillar IIs scope remains narrowly focused on frontend fabs. While backend processes are formally included, current investments in backend remain limited because the European backend manufacturing sector is not competitive, leaving critical capacity gaps unaddressed. Operational expenditure support for backend activities is essential to enable industrial-scale deployment and ensure that Europe can meet automotive and broader industrial demand. To achieve this, a targeted revision of state aid rules should be envisaged, allowing OPEX support for specific segments of the supply chain, for example for backend operations, advanced packaging, testing, and assembly, while ensuring that funding remains efficient and focused. Beyond addressing backend, structural weaknesses (i.e. high energy costs, administrative burdens, permitting delays, and skill shortages) must be tackled to make Europe a competitive and reliable location for semiconductor production. Investments should strengthen the full automotive semiconductor ecosystem. EU-level coordination is critical to prevent fragmentation across Member States, and design/fabless companies as well as upstream suppliers should be fully integrated into the security-of-supply framework. Finally, the status and incentives of production facilities should be aligned with actual market needs and the requirements of full-value-chain integration. Pillar III Monitoring and crisis response Pillar III establishes monitoring and crisis response mechanisms, but its current approach is largely reactive and narrowly focused on semiconductor supply data. Existing tools rely heavily on static databases rather than real-time dialogue, which limits the EUs ability to anticipate geopolitical risks, export controls, or supply chain disruptions. System-level vulnerabilities in the automotive sector are insufficiently addressed, and governance does not fully integrate end-user industries or industrialisation challenges. Pillar III should replace passive data collection with proactive, continuous dialogue between industry and the Commission. Geopolitical risks, export controls, logistics, and bottlenecks should be monitored in real time, and the entire automotive ecosystem should be involved in crisis monitoring. Clear and predictable early-warning indicators should be established, focusing on non-substitutable components and geopolitical triggers. EU-level coordination is needed to prevent fragmented national responses, and crisis preparedness should consider industrialisation and market uptake bottlenecks, not only raw supply constraints.",

    "feedback": "My feedback reflects the perspective of a semiconductor start-up developing wide-spectrum image sensors for high-volume computer-vision applications. Our work focuses primarily on groundbreaking process technologies based on novel quantum materials. While the Chips Act is an important and timely initiative, it appears to be oriented mainly toward large companies and academic institutions. Historically, SMEs have played a crucial role in the European semiconductor and deep-tech landscape, yet their needs seem insufficiently considered in the design of current funding schemes. In my view, Europe will capture the greatest future value by investing in genuinely groundbreaking technologies. Part of that investment should indeed support academia and research institutes, but start-ups and spin-offs are equally vital. They are the engines that translate scientific breakthroughs into market-ready technologies. The Chips Act starts now supporting design-focused start-ups, while those working on novel process technologiessuch as ours do not seem to be taken into account when evaluating the current and future relevant funding instruments. In our specific case, no suitable calls for collaborative projects were available. The EIC Accelerator call for semiconductor technologies opened only once, and unfortunately at a time when we were not yet ready to apply. We believe this represents a missed opportunity, especially at a moment when technological sovereignty is so critical for Europe. Designers can be attracted abroad relatively easily. In contrast, infrastructure, process know-how, and manufacturing capabilities rooted in Europe are far harder to relocate. Europe does not need to compete exclusively on the most advanced CMOS nodes. Instead, it should invest now in diverse, innovative process technologies that will form the foundation of tomorrows semiconductor landscape. One of the most effective ways to do this is by supporting start-ups and spin-offs working on disruptive process technologies.",

    "feedback": "Region Skåne arbetar med forsknings- och innovationsfrågor utifrån sex specialiseringsområden (S3). För att stödja utvecklingen av S3områdena har ett Forsknings- och Innovationsråd (FIRS) etablerats, där privat och offentlig sektor, akademi samt nyckelaktörer inom Skånes innovationssystem är representerade. Som en del av samarbetet för hållbar tillväxt i linje med den regionala innovationsstrategin har FIRS prioriterat sex områden som har störst tillväxtpotential i Skåne där insatser kan bidra till internationell konkurrenskraft och lösa samhällsutmaningar. Dessa områden är Avancerade material och tillverkningsindustri; ESS, MAX IV och innovationssystemet Science Village; Life science och hälsa; Livsmedel; Smarta hållbara städer och Tech. Halvledarekosystemet är starkt inom flera delar av halvledarvärdekedjan och går på tvären av Skåne specialiseringsområden och är betydelsefull utifrån Skånes konkurrenskraft. Rekommendationer från Region Skåne: 1. Styrning och finansiering Harmoniserad styrning: identifiera och konsolidera organisationer som arbetar med halvledarpolicy, industri och akademi och försäkra stark industrirepresentation. Integrera ekonomisk säkerhet: Koppla Chips Act 2.0 till EU:s kommande relevanta doktriner och strategier, t ex ekonomiska säkerhet och råmaterialstrategi. 2. Regionala ekosystem och värdekedja Accelerera regionala ekosystem till interregionala: Finansiera interregionala nätverk för FoU, produktion och kompetensutveckling. Förbättra IPCEI-processen: Innan nästa steg, utvärdera effekten av IPCEI satsningar inom olika områden. Inkludera privata FoU-center, design, utrustning, material och komponenter. Stöd för avancerad paketering och chiplet-teknologier: Erkänn dessa som kritiska för nästa generations elektronik. 3. Forskning, innovation och industrialisering Inför industriella pilotlinjer som kompletterar forskningslinjer och möjliggör snabbare kommersialisering. Skapa en cyklisk finansiering för pilotlinjer i EU-budgeten. Förenkla ansökningsprocesser: Standardiserade mallar, Tvåstegsansökan med kort förslag, Proportionerliga rapporteringskrav för SMEs. Lab-to-Fab-to-Market: Koppla FoU-resultat till industriell produktion genom samarbete mellan RTOs, industri, företag och SME/startups. 4. Kompetensförsörjning Utforska hur befintliga initiativ såsom European Chips Skills Academy kan användas som EU-övergripande koordinator för utbildning, certifiering och kompetensutveckling. Europeisk utbildningsroadmap: inkludera hela kedjan från grundskola, gymansiet, universitet och livslångt lärande inom STEM. Replikera framgångsmodeller och förbättra dessa. Regionala talangekosystem: Replikera framgångsmodeller och förbättra dessa. Attrahera global talang: Inför snabbspår för visum, mobilitetsincitament och förbättrad livskvalitet i regioner. 5. Infrastruktur och resiliens Integrera halvledarindustrins behov i nationella strategier för vatten- och energiförsörjning. Använd digitala tvillingar där det är lämpligt för att accelerera utvecklingen. 6. Teknologiska prioriteringar AI och kvantteknologi: Säkerställ samordning mellan Chips Act 2.0, AI-paketet och Quantum Act. Framtidsorienterad investering: Identifiera marknadstrender och prioritera segment som ger strategisk autonomi (t.ex. kraft-elektronik, avancerade sensorer, AI-chip). Använd befintliga kartläggningar om strategiska tekniker (EU, national, regional).",

    "feedbackTextUserLanguage": "The Skåne Region deals with research and innovation issues based on six areas of specialisation (S3). To support the development of the S3 areas, a Research and Innovation Council (FIRS) has been established, in which the private and public sectors, academia and key players in Skåne’s innovation system are represented. As part of the cooperation for sustainable growth in line with the Regional Innovation Strategy, the FIRS has prioritised six areas with the highest growth potential in Skåne where interventions can contribute to international competitiveness and address societal challenges. These areas are Advanced Materials and Manufacturing; ESS, MAX IV and Science Village innovation system; Life science and health; Food products; Smart sustainable cities and Tech. The semiconductor ecosystem is strong in several parts of the semiconductor value chain, transcending Skåne’s specialisations, and is important from the point of view of Skåne’s competitiveness. Recommendations from Skåne Region: 1. Governance and Finance Harmonised Governance: identify and consolidate organisations involved in semiconductor policy, industry and academia and ensure strong industrial representation. Integrating economic security: Link the Chips Act 2.0 to upcoming relevant EU doctrines and strategies, such as economic security and raw materials strategy. 2. Regional ecosystems and value chains accelerate regional ecosystems to interregional: Funding interregional networks for R & D, production and skills development. Improve the IPCEI process: Before the next step, evaluate the impact of IPCEI interventions in different areas. Include private R & D centres, design, equipment, materials and components. Aid for advanced packaging and chip technologies: Recognise these as critical for next-generation electronics. 3. Research, innovation and industrialisation Introducing industrial pilot lines that complement research lines and enable faster commercialisation. Create a cyclical funding for pilot lines in the EU budget. Simplify application processes: Standardised templates, Two-step short proposal application, Proportional reporting requirements for SMEs. Lab-to-Fab-to-Market: Link R & D results to industrial production through cooperation between RTOs, industry, companies and SME/startups. 4. Skills provision Explore how existing initiatives such as the European Chips Skills Academy can be used as EU-wide coordinator for training, certification and skills development. European education roadmap: include the whole chain from primary school, gymansia, universities and lifelong learning in STEM. Replicate success models and improve them. Regional talent ecosystems: Replicate success models and improve them. Attracting global talent: Introduce fast-track visas, mobility incentives and improved quality of life in regions. 5. Infrastructure and resilience Integrate the needs of the semiconductor industry into national strategies for water and energy supply. Use digital twins where appropriate to accelerate progress. 6. Technological priorities AI and quantum technologies: Ensure coordination between the Chips Act 2.0, the AI package and the Quantum Act. Future-oriented investment: Identify market trends and prioritise segments that provide strategic autonomy (e.g. power electronics, advanced sensors, AI chips). Use existing maps on strategic technologies (EU, national, regional).",

The security of critical infrastructure in the European Union is about ensuring the resilience of key sectors such as energy, transport, connectivity and health to external action. This is definitely crucial and necessary for building a strong, secure and independent Europe. Many areas are still in the process of being defined and mapped, and there are few actions that can be measured so far. To some extent, Covid has created a demand bubble and silicon production capacity in Europe has been increased, but unfortunately, the complete production chain still has a gap in the testing and packaging process, which mostly takes place outside Europe. There is another gap in the EU’s work to improve safety in the wider area of electronics production, which is not sufficiently highlighted. Outside the area of integrated circuits, the production capacity of PCBs in Europe also requires accelerated action and support. The imbalance and closure of PCB production facilities since the 1990s for the development of PCB production in Asia has resulted in Europe currently producing less than 3 % of the PCB needs for electronics in the EU.

    "feedback": "Europe is strategically prioritizing semiconductor and quantum technologies to bolster its industrial competitiveness and technological sovereignty, in line with the Chips Act. Success will depend on leveraging existing strengths in areas like cryogenics, photonics, control electronics and specialized manufacturing, alongside increased investment in quantum-specific fabrication capabilities and dedicated pilot lines. Key challenges include transitioning from flexible R&D facilities to high-volume manufacturing, integrating quantum process design kits (PDKs) to standardize production workflows, and addressing the unique fabrication requirements of quantum processors potentially requiring dedicated or repurposed foundries and shared infrastructure models. To accelerate iteration cycles, retain strategic IP and create local industrial value, the Chips Act 2.0 should incorporate mechanisms that provide quantum companies with small-scale, in-house prototyping and fabrication pathways in addition to open foundry access. To maintain a leading position, Europe must also balance open global collaboration with the need for technological autonomy. This requires a nuanced, risk-based approach to partnerships, avoiding overly restrictive policies that could stifle innovation or discourage investment, while safeguarding critical capabilities and securing access to essential raw materials. Crucially, scaling quantum technologies demands a fully supported value chain from design and fabrication to testing and packaging alongside stronger cross-sector coordination between semiconductor, quantum and HPC industries. A collaborative, risk-based approach will be vital for fostering a competitive and resilient European quantum ecosystem. Suggested actions/Policy option 1. Make Quantum Chips a core pillar of Chips Act 2.0, with increased funding for pilot lines, enabling technologies, and quantum-specific manufacturing and testing capacity. 2. Support small-scale in-house prototyping facilities that can accelerate design iteration and IP retention, while still enabling controlled access for scientific communities under appropriate agreements. 3. Create flexible, industry-oriented funding instruments to support design, prototyping, fabrication and testing of quantum-enabling integrated circuits leveraging existing semiconductor value chain to reinforce the robustness of the quantum supply chain. 4. Adopt a risk-based international partnership framework, enabling cooperation with trusted allies while ensuring security of critical materials and technologies. 5. Support manufacturing and test infrastructure for all quantum modalities, considering areas where Europe already shows early commercial traction.",

    "feedback": "The first EU Chips Act has shifted Europes position in the global semiconductor landscape. It delivered long-needed political momentum and enabled the first concrete steps toward rebuilding advanced fabrication capacity, notably through the creation of the European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) by Infineon, NXP, Bosch and TSMC. Yet these measures remain insufficient for reaching the EUs 20% market-share target by 2028 or for ensuring long-term resilience. Several private-sector initiatives have already been delayed or reduced, including Intels projects in France and Germany, uncertainty around STMicroelectronics future footprint, and the gradual loss of legacy production such as NXPs Nijmegen line. These developments underline the fragility of the European ecosystem. A central difficulty is that, unlike aircraft manufacturingwhere the Airbus model succeeded because it produced a standardized, certifiable product with predictable demandsemiconductors do not benefit from stable, uniform market structures. Products differ widely across applications and evolve on short timescales. Simply providing fabrication capacity does not ensure that it will be used. Demand must be deliberately created; otherwise, the facilities established under Chips Act 1 risk underutilization. Chips Act 2.0 must therefore address both supply and demand in a coordinated manner. In this context, the University of Zurich proposes actions to better align research, infrastructure and industrial activity. A key element is the introduction of regular multi-project wafer (MPW) runs at mature nodes within ESMC. Although the planned 1210 nm capability is strategically valuable, much of Europes applied research and industrial electronics still relies on 135, 80, 65 and 28 nm technologies. Quarterly MPW runs supported by open or semi-open PDKs would enable universities, SMEs and research groups to design and prototype domestically. Publicly funded research projects involving IC design should, when technically feasible, be expected to use European manufacturing infrastructure to reinforce this pipeline and create predictable baseline demand. A longer-term objective is to strengthen Europes supply chain, including wafer production, post-processing, packaging and testing. Europe does not need to replicate the dense Asian fab clusters; a coordinated, distributed model is possible, but only if policy actively shapes demand through procurement commitments and targeted incentives. Defence procurement is an obvious mechanism: requiring a defined share of defence-related ICs to be produced within Europe would provide essential stability during early operation. Design enablement also requires attention. EUROPRACTICE should evolve from a license distributor to a technical support hub capable of assisting institutions moving toward open EDA toolchains. Zero-cost MPW access for open-PDK designs would reduce financial barriers and encourage domestic prototyping. In parallel, AI-assisted design tools can broaden participation, even if full automation remains a long-term objective. Europe must also address the shortage of skilled fab operators by supporting apprenticeships in lithography, etching, deposition and packagingareas that cannot be replaced by automation. Cryogenic electronics represent a final strategic domain. Although Europe invests heavily in quantum technologies, cryo-CMOS development remains limited. The GlobalFoundries 65 nm process is already well studied at low temperatures and could form a realistic platform for quantum-control electronicsprovided the EU supports cryogenic MPW shuttles or licensing agreements and integrates this work with ESMC and European quantum consortia. Together, these measures outline a plausible path toward a coherent European semiconductor ecosystem. The essential point is that fabrication capacity alone will not secure technological autonomy. Because semiconductor demand is not standardized, Europe must del",

    "feedback": "The VDMA represents 3,600 mechanical and plant engineering companies in Europe, employing around three million people in the EU. The EU Chips Act 1.0 aimed to strengthen Europes semiconductor value chain with 43 billion in funding but benefits for the machinery and equipment sector have been limited. Most approved projects focus on front-end SiC wafer production, leaving back-end capacity and broader value chain needs largely unmet. Key challenges remain: competitive energy prices, simplified regulation, skilled workforce, and better access to venture capital. Chips Act 2.0 should address the entire value chain, reinforce Europes strengths in equipment, materials, design and R&D, and maintain strict state aid rules to avoid subsidy races. International cooperation is essential under the principle of Open Strategic Autonomy, and local suppliers should play a greater role in subsidized projects, especially in advanced assembly.

    "feedback": "Water Europe (WE) supports the European Commissions evaluation of the EU Chips Act 2.0. Given the strategic role of semiconductors in Europes digitalisation, energy transition and industrial competitiveness, the revision of the Chips Act offers a unique opportunity to address all critical enablers of chip manufacturing. Yet, despite the recognised focus on energy efficiency and circularity, the current evaluation neglects water which is a fundamental resource of the value chain. Water is indispensable for semiconductor production. Today, the EU produces 3 million wafers per month, consuming 45 million m³ of freshwater - 15 m³ per 12-inch wafer. Advanced memory chips can require up to 21 litres of water per cm². Doubling production to 6 million wafers monthly by 2030 would raise water demand to between 72 and 108 million m³ per month, a 60-140% increase. Fab processes require ultra-pure water (UPW), with each wafer being rinsed around 100 times. Producing 1 litre of UPW requires 1.5 litres of freshwater, and impurities (even microscopic) can ruin chips and reduce yield. Water scarcity directly threatens manufacturing continuity. The 2021 Taiwanese drought forced major plants to limit operations, doubling global chip lead times and generating estimated EU-wide losses of around 27.5 million per month. At the same time, semiconductor production generates chemically loaded wastewater; by 2030, EU plants could discharge 1450 million m³ annually depending on recycling performance. Advanced water technologies therefore represent not only an environmental requirement but also a competitive lever. While global leaders recycle up to 86% of their process water, EU manufacturers average just 45%. Raising European recycling rates and deploying state-of-the-art purification solutions could reduce freshwater abstraction by 216 million m³ yearly and generate savings exceeding 1 billion. Because semiconductor policy objectives directly depend on secure and efficient water use, the Chips Act must explicitly integrate water management into its strategic framework, in line with the objective to build a water-smart economy. Achieving leading-edge manufacturing (sub-10nm) will require more sophisticated UPW systems. Improving Europes competitiveness hinges on reducing environmental and operational costs through advanced water reuse, while supply chain resilience cannot be ensured without assessing water availability and treatment capacity. Water Europe recommends: 1.Recognise water infrastructure and technologies as essential enablers, and water companies as partners in EU policy-making, for achieving EU semiconductor production goals and strategic autonomy. 2.Enable access to Chips Act funding for water purification, recycling, and wastewater treatment infrastructure specifically tailored to semiconductor manufacturing requirements. 3.Promote adoption of advanced water management technologies, best practices, guidelines and common water performance indicators to improve competitiveness, circularity and water efficiency in semiconductor production. 4.Integrate considerations on water resources in supply chain resilience assessments and permit requirements for semiconductor production. 5.Support partnerships and knowledge exchange platforms between semiconductor manufacturers, water technology providers, and regional water authorities to address water challenges. Water security is a structural pillar of semiconductor manufacturing . To build a resilient, competitive and sustainable chip ecosystem, the EU Chips Act 2.0 must embed water at its core.",

    "feedback": "Les composants semiconducteurs constituent aujourdhui des intrants essentiels de la plupart des autres industries, nécessaires à leurs fonctionnalités électroniques, et constituent le vecteur de la maîtrise de lespace numérique. Aussi, sans recherche dune indépendance stratégique dans le domaine, lEurope ne pourra poursuivre sans risques majeurs ses ambitions de prospérité et de liberté pour ses citoyens. Le CEA souligne limportance de poursuivre la stratégie de lEurope en matière de renforcement de sa base technologique et industrielle en semiconducteur sur la durée, dune part en capitalisant sur les avancées obtenues, et dautre part en adaptant la stratégie et les actions aux enseignements des deux premières années du Chips Act et aux évolutions du contexte économique et géopolitique. Concernant les avancées obtenues, le Pilier 1 du Chips Act a considérablement renforcé en Europe les capacités dinnovation et de transferts de technologies vers lindustrie, en établissant une stratégie dinvestissement coordonnée à léchelle de lUnion Européenne dans des infrastructures de masse critique ouvertes vers la communauté académique et les entreprises européennes. La poursuite dune telle stratégie de mutualisation des moyens des acteurs européens dans des infrastructures technologiques, quelle soit en matière de lignes pilotes de technologie semiconducteur ou bien denvironnement de conception, constitue un élément structurant pour le succès de la stratégie européenne. Lexploitation des investissements installés dans le cadre des lignes pilotes mérite dêtre poursuivie au-delà des programmes de R&D ayant présidé à leur lancement, en portant de nouveaux programmes de R&D de technologies de rupture. Ce volet amont gagnerait à être complété par un mécanisme de financement de laccès aux capacités des lignes pilotes pour les acteurs de la recherche académique européen pour accroître linclusion des communautés au-delà des organismes porteurs. Le transfert industriel des résultats dinnovation de ces lignes pilotes, quil soit vers des sites industriels existants ou la création de nouveaux acteurs pour la mise en place dusines « first of a kind », constitue le marqueur de succès de la stratégie du Chips Act. Ce succès repose sur la collaboration entre lindustrie, les acteurs des lignes pilotes et les fabless sappuyant sur linfrastructure de conception, au travers de projets soutenus par la Commission Européenne et les Etats Membres. En conséquence, le pilier 2 du Chips Act pourrait être revu pour permettre le financement direct par la Commission Européenne des actions de première industrialisation portées par les IPCEI ou de production de masse dindustrie « first of a kind ». Dans la compétition mondiale, lEurope fait face à des écosystèmes industriels appuyés sur de vastes marchés intérieurs et des politiques publiques structurées de lamont à laval de la chaine de valeur. Lagrégation de la demande au sein de lUnion peut constituer un puissant levier de soutien à lindustrie des semiconducteurs européenne. Il pourrait faire sens dintroduire dans les commandes publiques un recours à un contenu important en matière de semiconducteurs européens, et de stimuler lécosystème en investissant dans des infrastructures critiques européennes, telles que les réseaux de télécommunication terrestres et spatiaux, terminaux de communications équipant les forces armées et la sécurité civile, les infrastructures de calcul, les moyens de surveillance du territoire",

    "feedback": "We submit this contribution as authors of the attached document The European Reference Fab Executive Summary with Q&A Annex. The underlying concept The Transparent Reference Fab Blueprint for a Trustworthy and Transparent Manufacturing Network is deliberately published as an open blueprint so that stakeholders can scrutinise, reuse and adapt it in the context of Chips Act 2. The Transparent Reference Fab (TRF) is a proposal for a standardised, cloneable 300-mm reference fab at mature nodes (13065 nm) that provides trustworthy, auditable manufacturing capacity for security- and safety-critical chips and systems as shared European manufacturing infrastructure. It is the reference environment in which auditable & trustworthy dies and systems are manufactured. Clone sites can be deployed in a modular way as front-end lines, assembly/test hubs or combined facilities and can be scaled and specialised to match national, industrial and sectoral needs. The TRF combines front-end processing, test and advanced assembly into a single, governed infrastructure asset, with open design enablement so that industry, SMEs, start-ups and research actors can actually use this capacity. Cloning is enabled due to the transparent blueprint documentation. By hosting chiplet-aware design plus final system integration and test, the TRF turns external leading-edge compute dies into trustworthy systems, creating a systematic bridge to leading-edge nodes while keeping the final system-level trust anchor preferably via auditable trust-anchor dies manufactured in the TRF in Europe. Consultation contributions and our stakeholder discussions highlight four structural gaps that TRF directly addresses: 1. Mature-node sovereignty for long-lifecycle, security-relevant electronics. Europe still lacks dependable mature-node capacity, even though these nodes underpin critical infrastructure, industry and defence. TRF focuses on this mission and enables co-integration with leading-edge nodes: compute dies can be sourced globally but are only combined, tested and qualified in a trustworthy TRF environment, anchored by trust-anchor dies made in Europe. 2. A system view across front-end, assembly and board-level integration. Front-end investments are insufficient if assembly, test and board-level integration remain offshore. TRF turns these elements into one governed, traceable chain instead of separate projects. 3. Lab-to-fab transfer for enabling technologies and pilot lines. RTOs and EU pilot lines develop advanced technologies but often lack a stable industrial endpoint. TRF is conceived as an industrial layer on top: it does not replace pilot lines but offers a manufacturing-grade environment with clear quality and audit requirements for transitioning mature modules. 4. An open but industrial-ready design and EDA ecosystem. Access to design tools, fabrication and test remains a barrier for many SMEs. TRF addresses this through open PDKs, harmonised design kits and fair MPW/small-series schemes that lower entry barriers while remaining compatible with industrial qualification. The attached Executive Summary and Q&A explain how TRF complements RTOs and EU initiatives, why we propose a phased 130 nm 65 nm strategy with 130 nm as reference node, how a brownfield-first, ESG-conscious implementation can reduce risk and time-to-impact, and how the model is designed as a network of sites built from the same cloneable reference-fab blueprint rather than a single flagship fab. On this basis we recommend that Chips Act 2 (i) explicitly recognise trustworthy mature-node reference fabs with integrated test and assembly as strategic manufacturing infrastructure, (ii) open dedicated instruments for open, cloneable reference fabs that commit to open PDKs and SME-oriented access models, and (iii) link Pillar 3 monitoring to trustworthy manufacturing capacity by defining criteria for such reference fabs and integrating them into crisis and defence monitoring.",

    "feedback": "Advanced, consolidated and aligned conttribution from Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH (FZJ) as clarification to the first statement: Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH (FZJ) welcomes the initiative of the European Commission to review the Chips Act and to launch an ambitious Chips Act 2.0. As a member of the Helmholtz Association with some 7,600 employees, we conduct interdisciplinary research into a digitalized society, a climate-friendly energy system, and a sustainable economy. We combine our expertise in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence using unique scientific infrastructures. Currently, all AI activities are based on the same technical principles, primarily utilizing GPUs. From a systems perspective, this approach is highly power-consuming and inefficient, and it is expected that only incremental evolutionary improvements will be achieved in the future. For the next generation of AI, it is essential to give greater attention to the emerging principles already present in scientific research, including the utilization of novel devices, such as those based on neuromorphic computing. These principles open the potential for revolutionary AI implementations with significantly reduced power consumption. However, this shift also necessitates a highly specialized co-design approach, encompassing everything from application and training to algorithms, implementations, and specific technologies. Currently, these efforts are primarily driven by the scientific community, yet it is crucial that they are adequately represented in future European initiatives like ChipsJU to ensure European sovereignty in this field. To achieve this, the following measures are necessary (without claiming to be exhaustive): 1. Accessible and cost-effective access to pilot lines with feature sizes below 10nm to make these technologies economically viable for companies. 2. Integration of emerging devices (e.g., memristors, ferroelectric transistors, etc.) into pilot line processes. 3. Seamless transfer of experimental devices into established pilot lines. 4. Development of process design kits (PDKs) tailored to such emerging devices. 5. Design of functional libraries that provide key functionalities with these devices for use in pilot lines. 6. Enhancement of development workflows to support these devices. 7. Development of co-design workflows that integrate both hardware and software considerations. These actions should lead to more extensive, particularly hardware-related, research and transfer of future AI principles. These actions are in no way intended to compete with the ongoing quantum computing efforts within the EU. Rather, they should be viewed as complementary, with the goal of leveraging Europe's strengths in adopting innovative concepts, as opposed to relying on traditional 'brute force' scaling methods. Quantum chip design and manufacturing are essential to the EUs technological sovereignty. The first Chips Act successfully launched pilot lines for quantum chips, laying the groundwork for competitive European capabilities in this strategic area. As the European Commission prepares the upcoming Quantum Act, it is crucial that Chips Act 2.0 both reinforces and complements these initiatives, creating a coherent framework that accelerates quantum-hardware development from research through to industrialization. Strengthening the EUs capacity to design, prototype, and manufacture quantum chips will be critical for securing leadership in this strategic domain and safeguarding the EUs strategic autonomy.",

    "feedback": "Including PCB production and population in the European Chips Act 2.0 is important to increase technological independence. Chips alone do not create functional systems; reliable PCB and board population with electronic components is an important step to produce reliable functional systems. Today, Europe relies heavily on Asian assembly for high volume products. Challenges to the PCB technological evolution and PCB population are driven by dedicated high pin-count devices (e.g. µ-vias, multiple layer stackings, heat dissipation, coating) and require highly specialized board population processes (temperature profiles, solder alloys, soldering techniques). Relying with respect to these crucial process on non-European sources leaves strategic sectors exposed to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks. By enhancing PCB and EMS capabilities, Europe can secure its entire electronics value chain and strengthen resilience. This capability is vital for space applications, where satellites demand high-reliability PCBs and EMS processes. It is also crucial for defense systems, ensuring operational sovereignty and preventing foreign interference in mission-critical technologies. Furthermore, domestic PCB and EMS enhances data security by reducing risks of hardware-level tampering and supports compliance with EU cybersecurity and privacy standards. Beyond security, investing in PCB and EMS drives economic growth, creates high-tech jobs and accelerates innovation in aerospace, automotive and other sectors. It maximizes the return on semiconductor investments by completing the ecosystem from chip to board. Localized production also supports Europes sustainability goals by lowering carbon emissions associated with global supply chains and enabling greener manufacturing practices. For Europe to maintain leadership in space, defense and critical infrastructure, PCB and EMS is recommended to be included in funding, standards development and collaborative initiatives under Chips Act 2.0.",

    "feedback": "The European Chips Act is a highly valuable initiative, and its continuation, expansion, and reinforcement are indispensable. The structural gaps that Europe faces across the semiconductor value chain cannot be closed within only a few years; addressing them requires sustained, long-term programs that ensure continuity, predictability, and stability. It is very important that these programs remain inclusive in scope, engaging all actors capable of contributing to the shared objective of strengthening the European Unions competitiveness in the strategically vital domain of microelectronics. As a research and technology organization developing complex instrumentation for fundamental science and related applications, we would like to highlight two specific areas where further emphasis would generate significant impact. The first concerns the development of integrated electronics and systems designed to operate in extreme environmentsspecifically, temperatures well outside the conventional 40 °C to +125 °C range and/or high-radiation conditions. Such specialized circuits are essential for state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation, including accelerator-based experiments, neutrino and dark-matter detectors, and large astroparticle observatories, all of which depend on custom high-performance integrated systems capable of maintaining stability and precision under challenging conditions. Similar requirements arise in several other strategic domains: emerging fields such as quantum technologies and fusion-reactor diagnostics; rapidly expanding sectors such as space exploration and Earth-observation systems; and consolidated industries, including automotive. Electronics for extreme environments therefore represent an area in which the EU still holds a significant opportunity to achieve international leadership within a relatively short timeframe. However, the reliable design of CMOS-based integrated circuits for such environments is currently hindered by several technical and structural barriers. These include the limited availability of foundry models and digital libraries characterized for extreme temperatures or high-radiation operation, as well as the shortage of more complex reusable IP blockssuch as high-resolution data converters, phase-locked loops, timing circuits, and digital signal-processing coresspecifically adapted to harsh-environment constraints. Addressing these gaps would substantially accelerate innovation across scientific, industrial, and emerging markets and would constitute the naturaland necessarycomplement to the important efforts already underway in wide-bandgap semiconductor technologies. The second key point is the persistent shortage of skilled professionals across the semiconductor ecosystem, and particularly in integrated-circuit design. Efforts to attract, educate, and retain talent must be further intensified, with special attention to mechanisms that effectively bridge the gap between academic training and industrial practice. Such mechanisms are especially valuable for small and medium-sized enterprises, which often lack the resources and risk-tolerance needed to train new personnel independently. In this context, organizations capable of providing practical, realistic use casesand that are inherently more resilient to the risks associated with involving in-training personnel in advanced projectscan play a pivotal role. By offering hands-on experience across full design cycles, these organizations can significantly accelerate workforce development, strengthen Europes semiconductor capabilities, and ensure that the objectives of the European Chips Act translate into long-term, sustainable impact.",

    "feedback": "Europes semiconductor ecosystem remains constrained by limited design access, fragmented state-aid procedures, workforce shortages, and the absence of sustainability-aligned incentives. While the 2023 Chips Act was an essential foundation, its implementation has shown structural gaps. SMEs and universities still lack affordable access to design tools, IP libraries, and pilot lines; permitting for semiconductor projects remains inconsistent and slow across Member States; new facilities face talent shortages; and environmental considerations remain insufficiently integrated. As a result, Europe risks missing its goal of strengthening resilience and competitiveness across the semiconductor value chain. A revised Chips Act 2.0 should shift focus from manufacturing volume toward ecosystem capacity. I propose a framework built around four pillars. First, the Act should establish an EU Open Chip Platform providing open-source EDA tools, shared IP blocks, and accessible pilot-line capacity. Reserving a share of public pilot-line time for SMEs and research institutions would broaden participation and unlock innovation beyond large incumbents. Second, a unified EU coordination portal should streamline state-aid approvals, environmental permitting, and grid-access processes. Introducing binding timelines and transparent dashboards would reduce delays that currently discourage private investment. Third, the Act should create a talent-mobility and workforce program including semiconductor-specific vocational pathways, a harmonized curriculum, and facilitated mobility for engineers across Member States. Without a skilled workforce, new R&D capacity and fabrication facilities cannot operate at scale. Fourth, sustainability-linked incentives should be incorporated by tying state-aid intensity to low-carbon energy use and resource-efficient production. Aligning semiconductor expansion with the European Green Deal strengthens Europes long-term competitiveness and attracts companies seeking low-carbon supply chains. These four pillars directly address the shortcomings of Chips Act 1.0. Open design access resolves the current concentration of design capability among a few large firms. A unified coordination portal removes fragmentation that delayed several major investment projects. Workforce programs mitigate the talent shortages that have limited operational readiness. Sustainability incentives ensure that semiconductor scaling is environmentally and economically viable in Europes regulatory context. Together, these reforms transform the Chips Act from a fabrication-centric intervention into a coherent ecosystem strategy. Concerns about centralization, cost, or competitiveness can be mitigated. The proposed coordination portal preserves Member State authority while simplifying procedures. Open-source design tools complement, not replace, proprietary systems. Sustainability incentives reward efficient production rather than impose burdens. And allocating a portion of pilot-line access to SMEs enables innovation without restricting industrial deployment. Chips Act 2.0 can therefore enhance Europes semiconductor resilience, broaden participation, and ensure that public investment delivers long-term strategic benefit.",

Custom-designed microelectronic components, developed using advanced technologies, are essential elements of these sophisticated instruments. These microelectronics are tailored to meet the stringent operational requirements of CERNs unique particle-physics detectors. Their complexity arises from the need to operate reliably in extreme environments while delivering high precision and fast data processing.

    "feedback": "LUnione Europea attraverso lEuropean Chips Act ha come obiettivo lincremento della capacità produttiva interna di semiconduttori, ma la vera sovranità in un settore industriale la si ottiene attraverso la supremazia e il controllo sul design. La progettazione dei dispositivi a semiconduttore è estremamente importante perché consente la realizzazione di componenti microelettronici fondati su architetture aperte, trasparenti e verificabili, in grado di assicurare elevati standard di sicurezza hardware, affidabilità dei processi di validazione e autonomia tecnologica lungo lintera catena del valore. Requisiti di questa natura risultano particolarmente critici in settori strategici quali edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT), infrastrutture critiche e piattaforme digitali di rilevanza nazionale. Questo concetto potrebbe trarre in inganno perché lascia pensare alla sola progettazione dei dispositivi microelettronici a semiconduttore, settore dove comunque lEuropa oggi si colloca ad un livello alto su scala mondiale. Il conseguimento di una effettiva sovranità tecnologica europea implica pertanto un intervento di carattere sistemico, che trascende la mera espansione delle capacità manifatturiere. Esso richiede la costruzione di un ecosistema integrato comprensivo di: programmi avanzati di formazione e sviluppo di competenze specialistiche, politiche industriali coordinate e con orizzonte di lungo periodo, investimenti significativi nella ricerca fondamentale e applicata, meccanismi strutturati di cooperazione transnazionale, nonché un quadro regolatorio idoneo a favorire una crescita sostenibile, sicura e competitiva dellindustria dei semiconduttori. Sono diverse le iniziative, intraprese dallattuale programma, rivolte al coordinamento dellecosistema. Il nuovo intervento dovrebbe dare valore allintera filiera produttiva puntando soprattutto sui settori con maggiore margine di crescita e valore aggiunto per aumentare la competitività sul medio e lungo periodo. Se si pensa alla filiera produttiva dei semiconduttori, ad eccezione del settore delle materie prime dove lEuropa manifesta rilevanti carenze, il settore della progettazione e della fabbricazione di macchinari per la produzione e il test risulta essere quello dove lEuropa rappresenta leccellenza mondiale. Il settore della fabbricazione di dispositivi su wafer è completamente automatizzato ed controllato dalle macchine di produzione. Se associamo a questo talento naturale, del vecchio continente, la necessità sempre più spinta di integrazione di semiconduttori eterogenei si dovrebbe puntare a rafforzare il comparto tecnologico destinato alla back-end technology. Il back-end destinato allintegrazione eterogenea di diversi semiconduttori, attualmente oggetto di unespansione significativa, richiede uno sforzo scientifico e tecnologico finalizzato alla realizzazione di circuiti (system in package) integrati direttamente a livello di die, superando il tradizionale paradigma basato su PCB. Questo approccio, già da tempo adottato dalle principali realtà industriali globali per prodotti destinati alla grande scala, è destinato a generare vantaggi competitivi rilevanti in settori quali difesa, sicurezza, automotive e, in particolare, automazione industriale e robotica. Nella seconda fase delliniziativa EU Chips Act, bisognerebbe analizzare bene la Heterogeneous Integration e applicare una politica finanziaria efficace, oltrepassando il concetto di first of a kind, a sostegno delle iniziative pubbliche e private già attive con lobiettivo di acquisire il know how necessario per recuperare un vantaggio competitivo internazionale ed avere il controllo su tutta la catena del valore.",

    "feedbackTextUserLanguage": "The European Union, through the European Chips Act, aims to strengthen domestic semiconductor production capacity, but real sovereignty in an industrial sector is achieved through supremacy and control over design. The design of semiconductor devices is extremely important because it enables the creation of microelectronic components based on open, transparent and verifiable architectures, capable of ensuring high standards of hardware security, reliability of validation processes and technological autonomy along the entire value chain. Requirements of this nature are particularly critical in strategic areas such as edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT), critical infrastructure and digital platforms of national relevance. This concept could be misled by thinking only about the design of semiconductor microelectronic devices, a sector where Europe is currently at a high global level. Achieving real European technological sovereignty therefore requires systemic action, going beyond the mere expansion of manufacturing capacities. It requires the construction of an integrated ecosystem including: advanced training and skills development programmes, coordinated and long-term industrial policies, significant investment in fundamental and applied research, structured mechanisms for transnational cooperation, and a regulatory framework conducive to sustainable, secure and competitive growth in the semiconductor industry. A number of initiatives have been taken since the current programme to coordinate the ecosystem. The new measure should add value to the entire production chain, focusing in particular on the sectors with the greatest scope for growth and added value in order to increase competitiveness in the medium and long term. Taking into account the semiconductor production chain, with the exception of the raw materials sector, where there are major shortages in Europe, the sector of design and manufacture of production and testing machinery is the one where Europe is the world leader. The wafer manufacturing sector is fully automated and controlled by production machines. If we combine this natural talent from the old continent with the growing need to integrate heterogeneous semiconductors, we should aim to strengthen the technology sector for back-end technology. The backend intended for the heterogeneous allintegration of various semiconductors, which is currently undergoing significant expansion, requires a scientific and technological effort aimed at creating integrated circuits (system packages) directly at day level, overcoming the traditional PCB-based paradigm. This approach, which has long been adopted by the main global industrial players for large-scale products, is intended to generate significant competitive advantages in areas such as defence, security, automotive and, in particular, industrial automation and robotics. In the second phase of the EU Chips Act, Heterogeneous Integration should be thoroughly analysed and an effective financial policy applied, going beyond the concept of first of a kind, in support of already active public and private initiatives with the aim of acquiring the know-how needed to regain an international competitive advantage and to have control over the entire value chain.",

    "feedback": "The objective of the European Chip Act reflects a strong desire to strengthen the independence of Europe's electronics industry. Within this value chain, the PCB is one of the most critical links. This product, which defines all the electrical connections that link each chip and component, embodies a significant portion of the expertise of design offices. Each PCB is linked to a single function, and therefore, even though PCB factories employ only 14,000 people in Europe, they are directly connected to all electronics design offices. We are beginning to see significant growth in Asia in the supply of pre-wired printed circuit boards (PCBs + PCBAs), suggesting an increase in the added value of electronic functions. This strategy, which we've seen in the telephony and solar panel sectors (now almost entirely manufactured in Asia), risks being repeated. The difference will be that we'll be dealing with sectors such as our defense, healthcare, and mobility electronics industries. It is imperative to integrate PCBs and PCBAs into the European Chip Act 2 if we don't want to miss the objective of strengthening our electronic independence.",

    "feedback": "The feedforward for the upcoming revision of the CHIPS Act is articulated in 7 policy focus points, to be linked to the European Semiconductors Regions Alliance paper, attached, which was adopted by the ESRA political network in July 2025. Insofar as possible, policies designed should identify how to best make use of the regional dimension as a multiplier and a facilitator of european level policies, leveraging the capillarity and close connection to regional stakeholders and \"small\"/\"smaller\" actors, thereby bringing into view a holistic integration of the whole European value chain and overcome geographical, policy and financing fragmentation. 1. Strengthen Pre-Commercial Procurement with Regional Integration: - Advocate for EU-level mechanisms that prioritize innovative public procurement to accelerate adoption of European semiconductor technologies. - Link procurement to regional specializations by mapping technologies developed in EU territories that can serve strategic projects (e.g., AI giga-factories, critical infrastructures). - Foster, even at the risk of hindering or slowing pan-European deployment, conditionality in public procurement: introduce or reinforce minimum thresholds for EU-origin technology to stimulate demand for European SMEs and startups. 2. Reinforce the Entire Semiconductor Value Chain: - Support industrial segments beyond chip manufacturing, including equipment suppliers and technology adopters (AI, automotive, quantum, photonics). - Develop financial instruments to help user industries absorb higher costs of EU technologies compared to non-EU competitors. - Promote lab-to-fab strategies for technology transfer, ensuring R&D results scale to industrial deployment. 3. Enable Interregional Cooperation and Extended Value Chains: - Create a European Competence Map to identify complementarities across regional ecosystems. - Incentivize cross-regional clusters and partnerships to reduce competition and foster joint projects. - Recognize extended value chains in funding criteria (e.g., clusters in neighboring regions should be favored in large-scale investments). 4. Align and Combine Funding Streams: - Establish mechanisms to blend EU, national, and regional funds for strategic projects that cannot rely solely on IPCEI or Chips JU. - Avoid over-dependence on Member State budgets for transformative projects; ensure direct EU contributions for ecosystem-building initiatives. 5. Develop Talent and Mobility Incentives: - Introduce joint training programs with special conditions for semiconductor sectors to make them more attractive. - Promote intra-EU mobility schemes for skilled workers, enabling regions with strong academic capacity to benefit from workforce circulation. - Offer incentives for companies participating in collaborative training and reskilling programs. 6. Integrate Semiconductor Policy with Complementary Tech Strategies: - Ensure legislative coherence between semiconductor policies and those for AI, quantum, photonics, and automotive, given their interdependence. 7. Accelerate Technology Transfer: - Implement a robust technology transfer policy to move innovations from lab to fab, beyond pilot lines. - Support industrial-scale deployment through targeted, diversified funding and regulatory facilitation.",

Solo attraverso la convergenza di tali elementi lUnione Europea potrà consolidare la propria autonomia tecnologica, rafforzare la resilienza economica e preservare la sovranità digitale nel medio e lungo termine. La filiera produttiva dei semiconduttori, viene identificata come di seguito riportato: Materiali, strumenti di produzione Ricerca e sviluppo (R&D) e progettazione (design) e proprietà intellettuale (IP) Produzione (fabbricazione) sul wafer il cosiddetto front-end Assemblaggio, packaging e testing il back-end Distribuzione e forniture verso i produttori di dispositivi finali (OEM). Se si esclude la voce materiali, dove lEuropa risulta particolarmente poco ricca sono da attenzionare tutti i settori sopra identificati. Particolare attenzione va rivolta ai settori dove si possiedono vantaggi competitivi, come la progettazione e fabbricazione di macchine di produzione e test per poter mantenere o accrescere il proprio valore tecnologico finalizzato allo scambio in ambito internazionale. Il comparto R&D e IP necessita di ulteriore potenziamento per raggiungere un livello di maturità tecnologica comparabile con gli Stati Uniti. Il settore produttivo wafer level richiede, da solo, sforzi economici ingenti e ben al di sopra delle cifre finora investite e inoltre il processo produttivo risulta completamente automatizzato, richiedendo un numero esiguo di competenze altamente specializzate che ormai operano nel settore della fabbricazione degli strumenti e delle macchine di produzione. Questo settore può essere delocalizzato in aree socio-politicamente stabili e energeticamente favorevoli. Il back-end dei semiconduttori, oggi particolarmente in fase di sviluppo, richiede investimenti in ambito scientifico e tecnologico per produrre circuiti elettronici eterogenei che possano essere integrati die level e non con il classico processo PCB. Questo approccio innovativo già da tempo intrapreso dalle grandi compagnie internazionali su prodotti mass production poterà un notevole vantaggio nei settori, come: difesa, sicurezza, automotive e soprattutto lautomazione industriale compreso il settore della robotica.",

Apart from materials, where Europe is particularly unrich, all the sectors identified above should be targeted. Particular attention should be paid to sectors with competitive advantages, such as the design and manufacture of production machines and tests in order to maintain or increase their technological value for international trade. R & D and IP need further strengthening to reach a comparable Technology Readiness Level with the US. The wafer level production sector alone requires considerable economic efforts, well above the figures invested so far, and the production process is fully automated, requiring a small number of highly specialised skills that are now active in the manufacturing of production tools and machines. This sector can be relocated to socio-politically stable and energy friendly areas. The semiconductor back-end, which is currently particularly under development, requires scientific and technological investment to produce heterogeneous electronic circuits that can be integrated at die level and not with the classic PCB process.

    "feedback": "Kalray welcomes the European Commissions initiative to revise the Chips Act. Adopted in September 2023 to address semiconductor shortages, the Chips Act must now evolve to reflect a transformed market, rapid technological shifts, and new geopolitical realities. While the ambition to secure a 20% EU market share by 2030 is both commendable and necessary, the current framework could better support the key players best positioned to realize it: fabless innovators like Kalray, which have been at the forefront of the AI chip domaina segment critical to meeting Europes targets. Our experience highlights some of the challenges in this endeavor. As an early and active contributor to policy discussions, we have engaged constructively with European and national decision-makers, yet we have encountered structural obstacles: Exclusion from the IPCEIs Sense Pilar on Microelectronics despite our strategic alignment, with limited transparency in the criteria underlying the selection decisions. A misalignment with the EIC, where our roadmap, focused on cutting-edge AI hardware, was not fully recognized as a 'priority' or 'strategic' initiative, which seems inconsistent with the EUs broader objectives. Ongoing hurdles in fundraising, as venture capital remains cautious about scaling deep-tech companies, and public funding has traditionally favored traditional fabs on mature nodes, which may not fully align with emerging market needs like AI. Complexities in the allocation process for EU funds, where navigating administrative requirements can sometimes overshadow core business priorities. These challenges reveal a significant gap between the Chips Acts ambitious goals and the practical support needed to achieve themespecially for the fabless and design ecosystems that are critical to Europes competitiveness in advanced semiconductor technologies. Yet, these innovatorswho will drive demand for cutting-edge nodes and then attract major manufacturers like TSMC, Intel, or Samsunghave received disproportionately little attention compared to traditional semiconductor factories. Europes capacity for advanced FinFET nodes (5nm and beyond) remains underdeveloped, and fostering their customer ecosystem is crucial to changing this dynamic. Fabless companies like Kalray, with their agile, innovation-driven models, represent one of Europes strongest assets for reducing dependencies, diversifying supply chains, and capturing high-growth opportunities. With enhanced support, they can fully contribute to Europes semiconductor sovereignty. This contribution aims to propose actionable recommendations to better integrate fabless ecosystems into a revised framework, ensuring the Chips Acts success. Recommendation 1: Formally recognize fabless companies as the cornerstone of a sovereign semiconductor ecosystem, with policies tailored to their distinct needs across the value chain. Recommendation 2: Provide targeted R&D supportthrough subsidies, tax incentives, or matched fundingto European fabless companies, particularly innovative SMEs, enabling them to develop sovereign design capabilities and secure a greater share of the value chain, in line with the Draghi reports recommendations. Recommendation 3 (inspired by the Draghi report and aligned with Eurostack): Establish procurement preferences for EU-produced chips in public data centers and HPC infrastructures, ensuring that public investments translate into sustainable market opportunities for European companies and reinforce the continents strategic autonomy in AI hardware. Recommendation 4: Launch an IPCEI dedicated to chiplet technologies, with a dual focus on: 1. Creating a European chiplet ecosystemincluding standardized interfaces, shared design tools, and a network of trusted assembly partnersto enable fabless companies to compete in global markets. 2. Tying public funding to measurable collaboration metrics, such as joint patents, shared roadmaps, or consortia-based projects",

    "feedback": "Joint recommendations of the SILICON ALPS Cluster, representing over 140 Austrian semiconductor stakeholders67% of them start-ups and SMEsfor the European Chips Act 2.0. The recommendations focus on strengthening Europes semiconductor competitiveness by addressing structural gaps, empowering innovation-driven SMEs, and expanding Europes technological and industrial sovereignty. Austrias semiconductor ecosystem combines strong design expertise, emerging fabless companies, advanced research institutions, and a growing talent base. To fully leverage this potential, Chips Act 2.0 must provide simplified access to funding, foster demand for European technologies, reduce supply-chain vulnerabilities, and support a coordinated pan-European skills and innovation framework. Key objectives include reinforcing Europes global competitiveness through balanced support across design, manufacturing, materials, and packaging; supporting the strategic value of the European fabless model; improving private capital mobilization; and broadening the semiconductor value chain to passive components, equipment, packaging, and system integration. Start-ups and SMEs require targeted support to translate technological innovation into market-ready products. Priority measures include strengthened accelerators, subsidized access to advanced design and prototyping tools, open-source PDKs and RISC-V technologies, tape-out co-funding, and shared test and validation infrastructure. Such instruments will accelerate time-to-market, reduce development risks, and stimulate entrepreneurial growth. To close Europes skills gap, the cluster recommends merging existing educational initiativesincluding GreenChips-EDU, Unite!, and TRANSFORMinto a pan-European Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC Chips). A microcredentials framework should support lifelong learning, labour mobility, and transparent recognition of semiconductor-relevant skills. Regulatory complexity remains a major barrier for SMEs. Enhanced state-aid schemes, simplified fast-track applications, cascade funding, regulatory sandboxes, and clearer long-term guidance are needed to improve access and reduce administrative burdens. The European Competitiveness Fund should implement SME-friendly financing instruments, including equity matching, milestone-based co-investment, revenue-sharing models, tax incentives, and support for capital-intensive hardware development. Stronger governance and coordination are essential. Regional clusters should be integrated directly into decision-making bodies such as the Chips Joint Undertaking and the European Semiconductor Regions Alliance. Demand-side incentivesespecially in automotive, energy, telecommunications, healthcare, and defenceshould stimulate early adoption of European chips through procurement frameworks and co-development programmes. Strategic opportunities for Europe include integrated photonics, edge AI, sustainable AI hardware, RISC-V, critical materials, equipment development, packaging, and substrates. Accelerated standardization processes and harmonized permitting procedures are crucial to lowering market-entry barriers and reducing delays in scaling production capacity. Overall, the recommendations call for a coherent, SME-centred Chips Act 2.0 that builds on regional strengths, improves Europes innovation-to-market capabilities, and transforms semiconductor research excellence into sustainable industrial leadership.",

With a strong presence in key markets, the company leverages cutting-edge technology to address the most pressing challenges faced by armed forces, security agencies, and industrial partners worldwide. HENSOLDT welcomes the opportunity to give feedback through this public consultation and calls for the specific needs of the European defence industry to be fully addressed in the context of the review of the EU Chips Act, as follows: Access to Custom Designs: For the defence sector, custom designs are only feasible in less advanced technologies, such as 22nm from Globalfoundries, utilizing standard UCIe packaging. It is crucial that we have ITAR-free access to these technologies, also for lower volumes in Europe to support defence applications. Advanced CMOS Nodes: The availability of more advanced CMOS nodes and corresponding design houses that provide products (e.g., AI, FPGAs, CPUs) in Europe is essential. In this context, the defence industry with its low volume will primarily act as an end-user rather than engaging in custom designs, and it will not significantly contribute to the necessary production volumes. Inclusion in Funding Initiatives: It is vital that the EU Chips Act does not exclude the defence industry from funding opportunities, as seen with ChipsJU. While we can submit proposals, they should not be limited to non-defence or dual-use products.",

    "feedback": "European Union should take a strategic, long-term approach in revising the Chips Act by prioritizing investments in chip design competence, reinforcing existing pilot lines, and ensuring sustainable funding for research and education. The foundation of a resilient semiconductor ecosystem begins with design. Manufacturing success depends on a strong base of skilled designers and design companies, especially in fabless models where design is decoupled from fabrication. Europes competitive edge lies in its application domain expertise. To maintain and grow this advantage, the EU must invest in design competence first. Without a robust design ecosystem, investments in advanced CMOS manufacturing facilities are premature and risky. The EU currently has only a handful of companies designing the most advanced CMOS nodes, with Nokia being one of the few. Building up design capabilities is essential to attract fabless companies and eventually justify large-scale manufacturing investments. Pilot lines established under the first Chips Act must be continuously supported and upgraded. They serve as platforms for innovation, enabling companies to prototype and commercialize new technologies. However, their success depends on ensuring that design companies have the resources and tools to access and utilize them effectively. Bridging the gap between design and manufacturing through improved design kits and integration is critical. On top of that, more European companies should be exploiting own chips in their portfolios. Currently many companies use off-the-shelf components or programmable general-purpose chips manufactured outside EU. To encourage companies to design their own chips, there should be financial support for pilot projects. Successful company pilots with the European pilot lines will show the companies that they can rely on European design competence and manufacturing capability. This is essential for securing the European self-sufficiency in semiconductors. In addition, the EU must place greater emphasis on advanced packaging and system integration. These areas are increasingly central to semiconductor performance, enabling compact, energy-efficient, and high-speed solutions. Packaging and integration are no longer peripheral concernsthey are strategic technologies that determine competitiveness in domains such as AI, communications, automotive, and edge computing. Europe must invest in infrastructure and R&D for heterogeneous integration, chiplet architectures, and photonic interconnects to remain globally relevant. Current funding mechanisms are too short-term and overly focused on immediate industrial needs. Academic research and education, which are vital for long-term competence development, are underfunded and lack strategic support. We call for stable, long-term funding that spans multiple election cycles and supports doctoral programs, competence centers, and academic-industry collaboration. Doctoral education must be rigorous and forward-looking; three-year programs are insufficient for producing the highest level of expertise needed in industrial and academic settings. Europe must also balance its investments between advanced CMOS and specialized technologies such as photonics, RF, MEMS, quantum, and advanced materials. These areas offer significant growth potential and global competitiveness. By supporting both emerging and established sectors, EU can build technological sovereignty and resilience across the semiconductor value chain. Manufacturing capability alone is not sufficient as technology without design tools will be useless. New tools are also essential for unconventional computing paradigms, e.g., quantum and neuromorphic. Advances are also needed to support software/hardware co-design. We advocate for a coordinated European strategy that pools the strengths of different regions and commits to a long-term vision for microelectronics. This enables EU to secure its position in critical sectors.",

    "feedback": "As a fully European PCB manufacturer, we want to emphasize a crucial point: Europe needs more than chips. The current Chips Act is an important first step, but it does not sufficiently strengthen Europes overall electronic and system-level resilience. By focusing mainly on front-end semiconductor manufacturing, the Act leaves critical bottlenecks in the back end of the electronics supply chain unresolvedthereby increasing Europes dependency on third countries. This poses concrete risks for defence, automotive, industrial automation, AI data centers, and other strategic sectors. Chips alone do not create functionality. They become operational only when integrated through conductive structures on printed circuit boards (PCBs) and assembled into PCBA modules and full systems. These layersPCB and PCBA production, packaging, and system integrationare strategic choke points. Addressing them is essential for maintaining Europes technological leadership and sovereignty. Additionally, Europe risks losing vital expertise. PCB technology is highly complex; deep competence cannot be developed through academic training alone but requires many years of industrial experience. PCBs and electronic assemblies are also susceptible to technical manipulation, as demonstrated in several studies (e.g., PANDA). Our recommendation is clear: Europe needs a Chips Act Plus that covers the entire electronics value chain. Specifically, we propose: Expanding the scope from silicon to complete systems: explicitly recognising PCB and PCBA manufacturing as strategic priorities, supported by dedicated funding instruments. Creating targeted incentives to strengthen European PCB and PCBA capacities, including minimum European content requirements and public support for building and maintaining production capabilities. Requiring PCBs that are manufactured and assembled in Europe for all safety- and security-critical applications and infrastructures not only to reduce strategic dependencies, but also to safeguard the essential industrial know-how that would otherwise be lost. In summary: Europe must take a holistic approachinvesting from chip fabs to end systems, from silicon and advanced packaging to PCB/PCBA manufacturingto secure technological resilience, sovereignty, and competitiveness. A Chips Act Plus is essential to achieve this.",

    "feedback": "From the University of Twente, The Netherlands: Strategic Feedback for the European Chip Act Current Situation Europes semiconductor share has dropped to ~10% and risks falling to 5% as the global market doubles. Existing European fabs (ST, GlobalFoundries, Intel Ireland) are limited to older nodes (>10nm), while advanced fabs mainly serve U.S.-based fabless companies. Key Challenges -Building new advanced fabs in Europe is costly, slow, and does not solve the lack of a European fabless ecosystem. -Europe has few significant fabless players; recent acquisitions (e.g., Dialog Renesas) further weaken the base. -Workforce shortage and long lead times limit rapid capacity expansion. Strategic Imperative -Do not focus solely on buying fabsthis is a short-term fix that fails to address Europes strategic vulnerability. -Build an ecosystem: Invest in fabless design companies, talent development, and next-generation technologies. -Leverage strengths: Europe excels in analog/RF; expand into digital and software design. -Future-oriented R&D: Prepare for post-4nm technologies (e.g., vertical transistors, 3D stacking) that can be mass-produced at low cost. Action Plan -Invest in design talent through universities and research institutions. -Support IMEC, LETI, and similar centers for advanced technology development. -Create incentives for fabless startups to grow a European customer base. -Combine public and private funding with a long-term vision (1020 years). Bottom Line: Europes strategic autonomy in semiconductors depends on creating a robust design and innovation ecosystemnot just building fabs.

    "feedback": "IG Metall welcomes the European Commissions initiative to review the European Chips Act. As Europes largest union representing workers in manufacturing and R&D, including semiconductors and microelectronics, we stress that the revision must go beyond strengthening Europes technological sovereignty. It should also create quality jobs and uphold social and environmental standards. The call for evidence rightly emphasizes reducing EU dependency and enhancing manufacturing capacity. The revised Chips Act should more explicitly promote establishment of as many production steps as possible within the EU, not just for leading-edge chips. The preservation and creation of quality employment must be an explicit objective. Europe has already witnessed the near-complete disappearance of PCB manufacturing and decline in backend semiconductor fabrication (assembly, packaging, testing). This trend must be reversed, as resilience cannot be achieved without a certain degree of all parts of the semiconductor production chain in Europe. Achieving this is feasible with the right kind of policy support, as all aspects of semiconductor production can be competitively done in the EU. With the shift to advanced packaging, backend production has become less dependent on low labour costs, which traditionally fuelled offshoring. We welcome that the Chips Act allows member state subsidies for first-of-a-kind semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the EU. We note positively that this definition includes leading-edge and legacy frontend production, semiconductor equipment, and backend production. We suggest further broadening this to include PCB manufacturing and semiconductor materials production. It should also cover frontend and backend manufacturing that is not first-of-a-kind in the EU but reduces dependence on production in non-EU countries. Such dependence must be reduced for all parts of the semiconductor production chain and for all types of semiconductors, not just leading-edge chips. Most importantly, we call for funding under the revised Chips Act to be explicitly linked to employment commitments, including minimum numbers of jobs to be created and maintained over a defined period with provisions for repayment of subsidies if commitments are not met. Public funding must be conditioned on robust social standards: Job security commitments with binding employment levels over defined durations Collective bargaining agreements with recognized trade unions Worker representation through works councils and equivalent structures These requirements are essential, not only because working in cleanroom environments is physically and mentally demanding. Effective worker representation is necessary to develop tailored solutions with management that protect worker health, promote qualification as well as vocational training and ensure decent working conditions. The revised Chips Act should ensure that funding mechanisms are more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises, supporting a diverse and resilient semiconductor ecosystem. If their projects are not suitable to be considered for support under Pillar 2 of the Chips Act, there should be clear mechanisms to refer them to relevant funding mechanisms. The call for evidence notes support for sustainable production facilities. IG Metall calls for concrete environmental criteria attached to funding decisions: Resource-efficient production using renewable energy Development of processes to avoid or minimize PFAS usage Water recycling and recovery systems In conclusion, the revision presents a critical opportunity to build a European semiconductor industry that is technologically advanced, economically resilient, socially just, and environmentally sustainable.

    "feedback": "The Chips Act I was primarily focused on new devices and downstream applications, utilizing equipment from established suppliers and traditional manufacturing technologies to enable it. This left a gap in the Chips Act I, where companies that create new chip manufacturing and metrology equipment were essentially left out. In general, semiconductor equipment manufacturing is the only place in the global chip manufacturing ecosystem that Europe plays an irreplaceable role - and lithography is one of Europe's last tech monopolies. There must be a way for companies that make new chip manufacturing or metrology equipment related to the semiconductor industry, to: (1) apply for targeted funding programs to bring these innovations to market. With targeted we mean smaller, flexible calls which do not require large consortiums with predefined commitments which is effectively excluding SMEs from defining and leading the projects; (2) fund access and testing of their prototype equipment in the pilot fab lines which will be established under the act.",

    "feedback": "Europes ambition to restore its technological sovereignty in semiconductors requires addressing not only chip production itself, but the entire value chain that enables electronics production. Our company is involved in the development, manufacturing and supply of materials of soldering, sintering, cleaning, cooling and protecting for the assembly of semiconductor, and electronic circuit. Those materials are indispensable to front-end, back-end and electronics manufacturing as they are used across strategic industries such as aerospace, AI, defence, energy, medical, mobility and telecommunications. The first Chips Act marked a decisive step, yet it overlooked several strategic links: advanced chemical materials, interconnection, assembly, cleaning, cooling and coating essential processes without which the semiconductor and industrial reliability standards of end markets cannot be achieved. This value chain is today fragmented and heavily dependent on non-European suppliers, especially in chemicals and metallurgy. Securing European chip manufacturing while leaving these segments exposed would continue to weaken the resilience of the whole ecosystem. The shift toward wide-bandgap semiconductors reinforces this need. These new materials operate under harsher electrical and thermal conditions, requiring interconnection solutions with excellent conductivity, heat dissipation and high-temperature resistance. Strengthening European capabilities in these domains is therefore a prerequisite for competitiveness in next-generation power electronics. Cleaning and cooling processes are equally critical. Cleaning ensures surface integrity at every stage of chip fabrication, especially after etching, while cooling dissipates the extreme heat generated during patterning. Historically based on PFAS, these processes now face major regulatory scrutiny. Supporting European companies in developing PFAS-free, recyclable and low-impact alternatives would significantly reduce the environmental footprint of semiconductor production while positioning Europe ahead of tightening global regulations. To achieve these goals, the Chips Act 2 should actively support R&D, industrial deployment and qualification of advanced materials and processes from low-TRL research to pilot lines and full-scale manufacturing. This includes promoting stronger collaboration between local industries, RTOs, public research, start-ups, SMEs and mid-caps, particularly in design, advanced chemistry, assembly and thermal management. Europe already hosts high-performing players in these areas, but they remain insufficiently connected and often overlooked compared to large manufacturers. Technological sovereignty cannot be achieved through isolated flagship fabs alone. It requires an integrated and sustainable ecosystem in which each link materials, equipment, design, interconnection, assembly, cleaning and cooling is recognized, supported and financed. Extending the Chips Act 2 to these segments would send a strong signal: Europe intends to invest where reliability, safety, sustainability and competitiveness truly begin",

    "feedback": "Bavaria is one of Europes most important semiconductor regions, with a focus on chip design, and is also a strong user location. A revised version of the European Chips Act (ECA) is expressly welcomed; however, the following points should be taken into account: ECA 2.0 should address the entire value chainfrom materials and chip design (including tools for chip design) to the printed circuit board. The first of a kind criterion partly prevents an effective strengthening of resilience. In the interest of our user industries, building additional capacities for legacy chips is particularly important. Therefore, for investment projects of special strategic importance, transparent, operational criteria should be defined in place of first of a kind. Considering recent experiences with NEXPERIA, it is also proposed that the backend - especially Advanced Packaging - be given significantly higher priority within ECA 2.0. Given the strategic importance of this issue, it is recommended that the European Union provide substantially more funding in the next financial framework. However, the focus should not solely be on improving supply through the highest possible subsidies. It is also about strengthening the demand side so that producing the relevant chips in Europe becomes profitable for companies. Simply postulating Buy European or linking it to subsidies does not appear promising if consumers are not willing to accept the associated risk premium in the final price. One possible approach could be a substantial expansion of data center capacities. It is proposed that potential European user industries, which as consumers of semiconductors form the backbone of our industrial base and whose needs in some cases vary greatly, be explicitly included in the objectives of ECA 2.0. and, where appropriate, prioritized (funding rate, speed). Particular mention should be made of the security and defense industry, for which secure and trusted supply chains (trusted electronics) are of especially high importance. Even if production volumes are often lower, the defense policy relevance is enormous. In addition, a successful energy transition with sustainable expansion of renewable energy increasingly requires intelligent control through specialized chips for grids. SMEs and innovative Start-Ups should receive special support regarding funding levels and assistance with the highly complex funding procedures. At the same time, the speed of the application process is crucial for the investment planning of applicant companies. A fast-track procedure should therefore be established at the European Commission. Furthermore, it is requested that regions be explicitly involved in ECA 2.0, as they are in direct contact with relevant companies and often contribute significantly to financing through co-funding. Explicit reference is made here to the position paper of the European Semiconductor Regions Alliance (ESRA) from July 2025. The microelectronics sector suffers from a shortage of skilled workers, which, according to numerous studies, will intensify significantly in the coming years. It therefore seems sensible that quantitative and qualitative measures to ensure the skilled workforce become a dedicated pillar of the ECA. Given the complexity, ECA 2.0 cannot actively address all relevant areas. However, it is suggested that (institutionalized) interfaces with other policy fields - such as securing rare earth elements - be explicitly included.",

Europes strengths in chiplets, photonics, and power electronics can form the basis of leadership in next-generation architectures, provided innovations reach the market. From Lab to Fab to Market EU collaborative R&D works; the next step is ensuring industrial deployment. Open, interoperable standards, such as Arms Foundation Chiplet System Architecture, can accelerate modular system innovation. Leveraging Production-Grade IP Europe should adopt production-ready solutions from trusted, like-minded partners. Arm Compute Subsystems (CSS) provide validated, export-compliant platforms enabling faster, more secure paths to tape-out. Upgrading EuroCDP The European Chips Design Platform must become a full system-level innovation environment.

    "feedback": "As a public research laboratory specializing in microelectronics and a member of the academic community supporting the European ecosystem, we welcome the evaluation of the Chips Act and the preparation of \"Chips Act 2\" . We fully support the objective of ensuring technological sovereignty and resilience . However, regarding the problem definition and policy options, we urge the Commission to broaden its scope beyond currently identified industrial strengths. Although Europe has a competitive edge in mainstream semiconductors such as power electronics and sensors , the future strategy must not be limited to these mature domains. Public research programs are currently driving critical innovations that go well beyond these established sectors. To secure the EU's position in \"future-defining technologies\" , the Chips Act 2 must explicitly support R&D in: - Components for Artificial Intelligence: European laboratories are pioneering new architectures for edge AI and neuromorphic computing. These innovations are vital for the \"AI factories\" and data centers mentioned in the review . - Advanced Design Capabilities: Sovereignty relies as much on design capacity as it does on manufacturing . Academic research is crucial for developing the next generation of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and complex System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. - Hardware Security: The review highlights the need for economic security and insight into technology leakage risks . Research laboratories are the primary source of innovation for hardware security, which directly supports the strategic goal of advancing the security of components for critical sectors like defense and security . Therefore, while we agree with the need to address the lack of manufacturing capacity for advanced nodes (<10nm) , the \"Chips for Europe Initiative\" (Pillar 1) must remain sufficiently funded and agile to support these upstream research areas. The evaluation should recognize that academic innovation in AI, design, and security is a fundamental prerequisite for the long-term competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the Union .",

    "feedback": "Building Europe's semiconductor ecosystem will not get along without a significant change in keeping the growth and maintenance of talents. The Chips Act 2 strategy should include a significant campaign to support the interest of the young generation in studying technical disciplines, not only electrical engineering, but also physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering and, of course, mathematics. The campaign must significantly affect young people already in primary and secondary schools, where their interest in their future profession is formed. It is necessary to look for attractive forms such as promotional excursions to universities and top scientific workplaces, excursions to research and development workplaces of industrial enterprises, discussions at schools with prominent personalities of the scientific and technical environment. For young people, it is necessary to organize summer schools of electrical engineering and other technical disciplines. At primary, secondary and higher education institutions, it is necessary to strongly support the participation of pupils and students in regional, national and international competitions in technical disciplines. The education system must receive adequate resources, both financial and human, for these activities. The whole of society needs to understand the strategic necessity of preparing the next generation of European technical intelligence. Europe's technical intelligence needs not only to be nurtured, but also to be maintained. Within individual EU countries, but also at the pan-European level, it is necessary to support the emergence of start-ups and SMEs, where new talent will find sufficient opportunities and employment. Start-ups and SMEs are essential for the recovery of the semiconductor industry in Europe. EU countries should help the developing industrial ecosystem by promoting and supporting the market demand for their innovative products. One of the forms of support is for example to co-finance their participation in international exhibitions and fairs, creating a shared infrastructure where start-ups and SMEs can test their innovations, create prototypes and test their features. Existing successful semiconductor and engineering companies should create or initiate an attractive social background for new talents and their young families in their area. The state should support such initiatives through tax policy.",

    "feedback": "In recent years, the German automotive industry has experienced one of the most severe supply crises in its history. The pandemic and global supply bottlenecks have highlighted the dependency on international value chains. Against this backdrop, the European Chips Act was an important step toward securing semiconductor supply and strengthening Europes technological sovereignty. The Chips Act 1.0 provided valuable impulses, particularly through the expansion of manufacturing capacities and the promotion of research clusters. Nevertheless, the ambitious goals were not achieved. The target of acquiring a 20% market share by 2030 proved to be unrealistic. Furthermore, clear interim milestones were missing. Third, the focus was placed on high-performance chips, which only make up a small percentage of European demand. The needs of key user industries, especially automotive and industrial manufacturers, were not sufficiently addressed. In an international comparison, Europe remains at a disadvantage. While China and the USA are investing billions to support their semiconductor industries, European funding is insufficient to create a competitive environment for investments. Targeted investments are indispensable for the automotive industry, which relies on power semiconductors and specialized chips for electromobility, automated driving, and digital connectivity. In addition to financial support, it will be necessary to create better framework conditions such as faster approval processes, competitive energy prices, a strong talent base, and a clear strategic focus on European strengths - automotive, industrial applications, IoT, and power semiconductors. This is the only way that long-term competitiveness can be ensured. The Chips Act 1.0 raised awareness and initiated processes for investments. The Chips Act 2.0 requires a more realistic, demand-driven, and accelerated approach. Consideration of user industries and a focus on European core competencies is crucial to building a resilient semiconductor economy and securing the future of the automotive industry.

    "feedback": "There is no doubt that Europe must strengthen its competitiveness in the semiconductor sector significantly decrease its dependencies on chips required for system-relevant industries in Europe like automotive, mechanical engineering or others. As mentioned in the VDE-position paper \"Hidden electronics IV\", it is highly recommended to strengthen the entire semiconductor system across the entire value chain. Europe must close existing gaps and prioritize support for those areas where expertise has been lost. This includes explicitly semiconductor materials as prerequisite for chip production, i.e. bulk crystal growth, wafering, and epitaxial layer deposition should be considered in this context. In addition, upcoming markets should be considered. This will require the development of new and advanced materials and their transition into industrial production. This includes new chip architectures and processing lines, but will also offer Europe a real opportunity to take a leading position. New markets include memristive chips for applications in machine learning & artificial intelligence, advanced high-power electronics for mobility as well as for energy harvesting and storing, as well as chips for quantum computing and communication. While the latter is already addressed through specific initiatives, the design and development of chips for AI and for high-efficiency power electronics should certainly considered a strategic priority. In this context, wide-bandgap materials may become one of the key enabling technologies. Promising emerging materials with large band gaps, such as aluminium nitride (AlN) or gallium oxide (Ga2O3) have already demonstrated their outstanding properties in device prototypes. Other promising materials, especially for memristive devices, are hafnium oxide (HfO2) on silicon or perovskites such as strontium or calcium titanate (SrTiO3, CaTiO3). Europe can build here on existing expertise. However, pilot lines for crystals growth, epitaxial layer deposition and device fabrication are required to transfer these capabilities into application and thus industrial competitiveness. Designing and producing new chips cannot be decoupled from advances in materials and materials processing. Therefore, close interaction with the recently established IAM-I would be highly beneficial and would enable synergies across the value chain. Power electronics play a crucial role in two of the target markets, namely materials for sustainable transport and materials for new energies. Memristive materials would be covered by the \"material for electronic appliances\" market. A coordinated effort to build a nearly complete ecosystem for these new materials and chip systems would provide a substantial advantage for Europe. One of the most critical steps in this process is the establishment of pilot lines across the various stages of the value chain. Supporting start-ups, especially in the early stages of the production chain, could accelerate this development. In summary, these measures can offer Europe a unique opportunity to establish a strong, competitive and resilient semiconductor landscape.",

    "feedback": "The revision of the Chips Act represents a decisive step toward consolidating Europes technological autonomy. However, for the goal of semiconductor sovereignty to become truly attainable, the European strategy must address a structural vulnerability that the first Chips Act did not adequately consider: the absence of a dedicated industrial policy for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) value chain. Without a strong, competitive and technologically advanced European capability in this field, the substantial investments allocated to semiconductor manufacturing risk remaining incomplete, because chips only become functional when integrated into physical substrates, interconnections and assembly processes that today depend almost entirely on non-European markets. Global PCB production is overwhelmingly concentrated in Asia, resulting in a loss of European skills, competitiveness and industrial resilience, and this dependency concerns not only finished products but also the upstream materials essential for PCB manufacturing laminates, resins, treated glass fibers, copper clads and other semi-finished products. The absence of a strategy for PCB manufacturing constitutes a fundamental industrial risk. Europes most strategic sectors defense, aerospace, space systems, AI, secure communications, medical technologies cannot rely on components that are neither produced nor controllable within the Union. High-reliability boards embody unique know-how, intellectual property and manufacturing processes; the outsourcing of such capabilities compromises both competitiveness and security. For this reason, Europe should also actively support European companies that already supply not only the strategic sectors mentioned above but are also capable today of providing advanced and complex technologies, including rigid-flex and HDI thereby enabling the development of the next generation of technologies such as future UltraHDI structures and IC substrates. Chips Act 2.0 is therefore the opportunity to correct this strategic oversight. The European policy must evolve from supporting the silicon-centric phase of the value chain to recognizing and strengthening the entire ecosystem that makes semiconductor functionality available in sophisticated electronic systems. The PCB and PCBA value chain must be acknowledged as an essential pillar of Europes technological sovereignty. For these reasons, the Commission is strongly encouraged to formally recognize PCB and PCBA manufacturing, together with the associated materials and production equipment, as strategic assets; to allocate dedicated funding and to promote an industrial policy consistent with Europes wider technological sovereignty ambitions. Only through an integrated and forward-looking approach will Europe be able to build an electronic ecosystem that is truly autonomous, resilient and globally competitive.",

In a capital-intensive field like microelectronics, an academic cannot be successful without help, and the Chips Act 2 should address these issues. We need an extension of the current Europractice project. It needs enough funding to support modern technologies at affordable MPW prices, and it needs new contracts with the EDA industry to provide essential, tapeout-ready IP like clock generation, SERDES, and memory controllers for academic usage. Without this support, we will not be able to innovate in a relevant manner, and our graduates will have no practical experience with state-of-the-art technology. To put it short: without this help from the Chips Act 2, we will lose further in comparison to other world regions. Novel technologies, like, for example, neuromorphic computing or brain-machine interfaces, will rely heavily on modern silicon technologies, and Europe is still competitive in these areas. If this shall last, the Chips Act 2 will have to set aside relevant funds to enable prototyping access, including IP and software, for academia.",

    "feedback": "Compound semiconductors are critically needed to enable the digital transformation, electrification and quantum revolution. Compound semiconductors are also an area where Europe already has worldwide leadership in science and technology, giving it a strong position, both to defend and to further develop. In light of this, lab-to-fab transfer and the capacity to innovate advanced chips should be consolidated and strengthened. To achieve these aims, there is an urgent need for a skilled workforce of technicians, engineers, and scientists familiar with clean room techniques and with semiconductor characterization and production technology. Europe also needs to provide access to the equipment and the competence sought by various stakeholders start-up companies, institutes as well as established firms to develop innovations from idea to market, providing employment opportunities in Europe which will contribute to European sovereignty and resilience in this critical area. Lund University has the capacity and ambition to host an integrated Research & Training Centre and Pilot line that addresses these needs within the specific area of Compound Semiconductors. Compound semiconductor nanodevice technology makes it possible to harvest the superior performance of specific, highly optimized material combinations on established silicon (Si) platforms. State-of-the-art compound semiconductor device technology is presently deployed in transistor and solar technology in European projects and developed for optical display techniques, future communication and radar-technology, sensor implementation for drug delivery, reconfigurable RF-electronics, neuromorphics, and the next generation of AI technology. Wide bandgap materials and power devices are under development and supported by the already established Pilot Line 4. For compound devices, generic process modules are created, and Process Design Kits (PDKs) have been established for devices created from our understanding of compound nanotechnology and material properties. Our aim is to establish a European Centre and Pilot line that integrates leading-edge research with workforce education including hands-on training in state-of-the-art semiconductor technology as well as lab-to-fab transfer. The Centre will make the technology available for European users through links to key innovation hubs in Europe as well as to the available Pan European network of competence centers and thus enable start-ups and SMEs to bring the information technology of the future to the market. The Centre will be located in the vicinity of the national Swedish Chips Competence Center (SCCC) to facilitate synergies and coordination. The effort will complement and support related activities in Pilot lines including APECS, WBG, and PIXE with a unique effort on innovation at lower TRLs and tech-transfer towards production.",

    "feedback": "The EU Chips Act A Strategic Perspective for Europe As the open consultation phase for the EU Chips Act begins, it is crucial to reflect on where Europe should position itself in the global semiconductor landscape. While subsidies funded by taxpayers often dominate the discussion, I believe public money should not be used to reinforce markets already controlled by major global players. These segments are mature, highly consolidated, and offer limited room for Europe to create unique value. Instead, Europe should focus on profitable niches where it can leverage its strengths: Consensus-building and collaboration Europes ability to align diverse stakeholders is a competitive advantage. Specialized markets Targeting areas where fragmentation and innovation thrive, rather than competing head-on in commoditized sectors. Value creation for Europe Investments should prioritize technologies and ecosystems that strengthen European sovereignty and long-term competitiveness. The Chips Act should not be about replicating what others have already mastered. It should be about shaping a future where Europe leads in strategic, high-value segments that matter for its economy and society.",

It brings together more than 800 members, including major industrial companies, SMEs, startups, and research laboratories. The EUs dependence on chip supplies is well recognized. Funding is needed across both front-end and back-end activities, particularly for advanced silicon nodes and heterogeneous integration of technologies, to strengthen European technological sovereignty. The aerospace and defense industrieswhose systems increasingly demand higher computing power, enhanced security, and guaranteed integrity while reducing carbon footprinthave very specific requirements. These include reliability, lifespan, and radiation performance, all directly linked to their mission environments. Sovereignty is becoming a critical issue for maintaining leadership in aerospace and defense applications. Although production volumes in these sectors are relatively low, targeted Chips Act 2 funding is expected to address these specific chip characteristics and potentially integrate them as early as the design phase. At the same time, the EU PCB industry is facing significant challenges and should be considered within Chips Act 2, as it remains a weak link in the electronics value chain. In the near future, embedding active and passive components (packaged or not) within PCBs will become a key differentiator in terms of both functional performance and physical integration. Ensuring reliability will be essential for these advanced technologies and will require dedicated measures.",

    "feedback": "As a university professor working in analogue and RF integrated circuit design, I rely daily on the availability of advanced design tools, fabrication technologies, and prototyping services to carry out high-quality research and to provide meaningful training to my students. In this context, the Europractice initiative is not simply a useful resource; it is an essential pillar that enables academic groups like mine to participate actively in Europes strategic microelectronics ecosystem. In analogue and RF IC design, access to silicon prototyping is not optional but fundamental. Many of the concepts we investigatelow-noise architectures, power-efficient RF front-ends, mixed-signal interfacescannot be fully validated through simulation alone. The ability to fabricate experimental chips, characterize them in the lab, and iterate on the design is what transforms theoretical ideas into concrete technological and scientific advances. Europractice provides a unique gateway to achieve this, offering affordable access to industrial-grade processes, multi-project wafer shuttles, and reliable support services that would otherwise be inaccessible to academic institutions. The impact of Europractice goes far beyond individual research projects. It enables universities to train the next generation of electronics engineers by exposing students to realistic design flows, professional EDA environments, and the full lifecycle of chip development. This hands-on experience is critical at a time when Europe faces a severe shortage of skilled professionals in microelectronics. Without robust initiatives like Europractice, it would be nearly impossible for academic programs to prepare students for careers in this demanding field. As Europe advances through initiatives such as the Chips Act, maintaining and expanding Europractice is vital. The strategic goals of technological sovereignty, innovation acceleration, and workforce development all depend on having accessible, sustainable, and continuously updated microelectronics design and prototyping infrastructure. To maximize impact, several actions are needed: expanding access to advanced technology nodes; securing long-term funding for academic participation; increasing visibility of training initiatives; and strengthening support for small prototyping volumes, which are indispensable for research and education. In summary, Europractice is an indispensable catalyst for academic research, industrial collaboration, and talent development in the semiconductor domain. Its continued support and expansion are crucial for ensuring that European universities can contribute meaningfully to scientific progress and to the strategic goals of Europes microelectronics ecosystem.",

Our sustained work in this area enables us to develop innovations in cross-cutting tasks in sectors such as health, the environment and communications, where the integration of different types of technology is fundamental. This is possible thanks to the continuous provision of the necessary resources in terms of EDA tools, access to manufacturing technologies and training in the various editions of EUROCHIP/EUROPRACTICE. This initiative provides access to both mature and advanced technologies, which support the integration of very low-power circuits, for example. We believe it is necessary to increase the critical mass of trained professionals in the sector. To this end, capacities and resources must be increased in different areas of action: a. Deepening training in fundamental technological aspects to cover technological advances; b. Increasing training in the design of highly integrated digital systems without losing sight of environmental criteria. c. Provide access to manufacturing facilities with the flexibility to handle small runs, which are typical of teaching and R&D projects, at an affordable cost. The CHIP Act promotes key aspects of technological sovereignty, particularly securing substantial investment in the sector in collaboration with companies. However, we believe that a shortage of trained personnel could hinder the securing of the necessary resources. This training must provide a systemic vision to facilitate permeability between traditionally isolated sectors. In order to promote competitiveness, the integration of new paradigms into microelectronic design methods must be considered. In this context, universities and their research groups could play a significant role if they receive adequate funding.",

    "feedback": "Chips Act 1 has laid a strong and future-oriented foundation for Europes semiconductor ambitions. By prioritizing in pillar 1 the pilot lines for the challenges of the next decade, the role of advanced packaging, heterogeneous integration and substrate innovations has correctly been acknowledged, as thereby Chips Act1 has targeted the technologies that are indispensable for next-generation semiconductor systems. These capabilities in advanced packaging and heterogenous integration are not just peripherals they are the decisive enablers of next geration products and industries that will shape Europes digital economy. With the coming Chips Act 2, the central challenge is to transform this technological groundwork into broad industrial impact. To do so, the next phase must deepen the involvement of industrial stakeholders and create faster, more effective pathways from research to application. Raising TRLs and accelerating the transfer of innovations into market-ready solutions are crucial stepsareas where Europe has historically lagged behind global competitors like US and Asia. Advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration at should therefore remain at the heart of its innovation strategy. These technologies determine performance, energy efficiency, form factor, and system functionality - - and modern semiconductors rely synergically on such capabilities. Advanced packaging and heterogenous integraion innovations define the competitiveness of semiconductor-based productsfrom high-performance computing and communication systems to AI accelerators, automotive electronics, medical devices, and emerging edge applications. Without strong European capabilities in this domain, even the most advanced chip designs cannot be realized, commercialized, or secured within Europe. Recent supply-chain disruptions have shown how fragile global dependencies can beeven for packaging steps that are far less complex than the innovations Europe now aims to develop. Europe cannot afford to be exposed again. Building resilient, high-performance, European-based advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration capabilities is therefore not simply beneficial but rather essential. Chips Act 2 can catalyze this transformation by ensuring that pilot lines have the operational capacity and mandate to rapidly elevate TRLs, enabling seamless knowledge and technology transfer to industrial users. This will not only sustain the innovation momentum of Chips Act 1 but unlock the full value of Europe's research excellence far beyond advanced node semiconductors, but rather for all industries requiring electronic systems. By embracing this vision, Chips Act 2 can position Europe at the forefront of next-generation electronic systemsensuring that Europe designs them, builds them throughout the full value chain - and benefits from them. Strengthening advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration is one of the keys to making this vision a reality for the entire European electronics ecosystem.",

    "feedback": "As OEM, integration is the critical convergence point where semiconductors, PCBs, substrates, and advanced packaging become mission-ready systems. For Space and Defense, this capability ensures security, reduces supply chain vulnerability, and supports innovation in high-density, high-reliability electronics. Satellites and defense platforms require assemblies that operate in harsh environments and address new challenges such as thermal and mechanical management for components with increasing power dissipation and I/O density. Chips Act 2 must therefore recognize OEM integration as a strategic pillar, allocate dedicated funding for interdependent technologies like PCBs and packaging, and invest in next-generation integration processes such as robotics, AI-driven testing, and eco-friendly solutions. It should also align with other on-going European initiatives to strengthen the entire electronics ecosystem. Without secure and coordinated development of these capabilities, Europe cannot achieve true technological sovereignty or protect its leadership in critical sectors for decades to come.",

    "feedback": "A holistic, coherent policy strategy and regulatory approach across all policy areas is needed to boost the EUs semiconductor industry. Semiconductors are a pervasive technology, key components of everyday electronics devices that make life easier, safer, more secure, and greener. Semiconductors are a common denominator for archieving European ambitions across the board, from the green to digital transitions. Europe is home to leading semiconductor manufacturers, like integrated device manufacturers and (specialty) foundries, equipment manufacturers, and material providers as well as research & technology organisations. Europe is strong in key industry verticals: automotive, industrial, Internet of Things (IoT), power, smart home, and medical applications. The revision of the EU Chips Act is an opportunity to further improve the legal framework and strengthen the semiconductor industry in Europe. It should focus on aligning with industry, end-market realities, and strengthening Europes position in the global value chain. It will be of utmost importance to set a clear focus on industrial deployment when revising the research dimension of the EU Chips Act. Todays research should be aimed at winning tomorrows markets. The revision should focus on conditions to innovate across all segments of the supply and value chains and strengthen the industrial innovation infrastructure. Cooperation with industry verticals should be strengthened and significantly expanded. It will be of utmost importance to address areas of artificial intelligence where mastering future breakthrough innovations will lead to a world-leading position of the semiconductor industry in Europe. A two-pronged approach targeting foundational chips for AI and European leading-edge chips for AI should be developed. The existing funding toolbox for supporting semiconductor projects demands improvement. A semiconductor budget for highly strategic projects should be established, underpinned with fast decision-making processes, flexible eligibility, ambitious budgets, and funding rates similar to many examples in other regions of the world. The scope of FOAK should be redefined to support the market needs of the upstream chip value chain and expanded. This should encompass relevant strategic suppliers and equipment makers, as well as joint ventures with end-users across strategic application sectors. An institutionalised high-level dialogue between policymakers and the semiconductor industry in Europe must be set up to address Europes competitiveness gap, focus on areas of European strength, and identify areas of critical and strategic technologies where Europe has the capacity to lead. Simplified administrative and regulatory rules should be implemented to empower companies to innovate and seize market opportunities and create a positive business environment to ensure fair competition among the different regions in the world.",

    "feedback": "Wacker Chemie from Germany, with its two polysilicon production sites in Germany, is Europes only manufacturer of polysilicon, and an essential player in Europes and the global semiconductor and solar supply chains. The Chips Act 2.0 should build on Europe's existing technological leadership and recognize the crucial role of European semiconductor material suppliers, who have contributed to Europe's economic resilience and technological development to date. Europe is home to the world's leading producer of semiconductor polysilicon, which is the crucial starting point of the entire global semiconductor supply chain. Firstly, the Chips Act 2.0 should reinforce the initiatives launched by the Clean Industrial Deal and its components, rather than being drafted in isolation. Other world regions have realized the importance of having their own semiconductor supply chains and have established dedicated industrial strategies with extensive financial support. In this highly competitive global landscape, the business conditions for energy-intensive European companies, such as polysilicon producers, remain extremely challenging. The EU Chips Act 2.0 should go beyond supporting semiconductor manufacturing alone and be extended to cover the entire value chain. This should include upstream activities such as the supply of raw materials (e.g. electronic-grade polysilicon), equipment and tool manufacturing, and downstream integration such as packaging, testing and system design. By addressing all critical stages, from materials and wafer production to advanced packaging and end-use applications, the Act can create a genuinely resilient and competitive ecosystem, reducing dependency on external suppliers and strengthening Europes technological sovereignty. Secondly, unrestricted access to silicon metal is of the utmost importance. Unwarranted EU import restrictions would unjustifiably increase domestic production costs for polysilicon. Thirdly, access to affordable/low carbon electricity with a long-term price predictability is needed for profitable and sustainable operations and products up to new investments in Europe.",

    "feedback": "As a teacher and researcher who designs and submits chips for fabrication, I see a significant gap that could be addressed by Chips Act 2: as far as I am aware, there are currently no European programs that fund chip fabrication for universities. All of the chips I submit must be financed through individual research project budgets, which means that only designs from PhD students or research engineers are ever manufactured never those from bachelors or masters students. When I was a graduate student, I had the opportunity to fabricate a 180 nm chip through the MOSIS Education Program. As a microelectronics student, being able not only to simulate but also to fabricate and test my own design made a big difference. It was highly motivating and enriched the learning experience. I am referring to initiatives using standard industry CAD tools, as our goal is to train engineers who are ready for the semiconductor industry. I believe the European Chips Act could meaningfully improve in this area. If a similar educational fabrication program already exists in Europe, I would be very interested to learn about it; otherwise, I see this as an important opportunity to strengthen microelectronics education and training. Additionally, open calls for funding to support summer schools and related educational initiatives would be highly valuable and greatly appreciated. EUROPRACTICE is highly valued by our community, especially for its mini@sic initiatives. The trainings it provides are consistently high-quality and remain accessible and affordable.",

    "feedback": "Chips Act 1 successfully strengthened Europes position in advanced manufacturing by creating pilot lines, attracting first-of-a-kind fabs, and establishing a coordinated framework for supply-chain monitoring. These achievements form a strong foundation, but Universities urgently need faster and more affordable prototyping, as long lead times currently are severely limiting research throughput. Prototyping costs must be reduced to approach the near-zero levels available in Taiwan, Korea, and China, allowing academics to test unconventional and high-risk ideas. Chips Act 2 should guarantee regular MPW shuttles not only for advanced CMOS, but also for BCD, high-voltage SOI, GaN/GaN-on-SOI, SiC, and other special technologies that are essential for power electronics and mixed-signal research. At least two academic shuttle runs per year per technology family would greatly improve planning and research continuity. Academic groups also require accessible advanced packaging and assembly options to support system-level prototypes. Strengthened support for EDA tools and design infrastructure is needed to train future semiconductor engineers and reduce barriers for university labs. Faster, simpler, and more transparent funding mechanisms would help academic institutions participate more effectively. By expanding on the strengths of Chips Act 1 and addressing these academic needs, Chips Act 2 can significantly improve Europes research capabilities and global competitiveness.",

    "feedback": "In todays rapidly evolving computing landscape, Europe must urgently adopt a comprehensive, integrated vision spanning the entire semiconductor value chain - from breakthrough materials and device innovation, through circuits and architectures, to the full design ecosystem including simulation, synthesis, and compilation tools. This vision must be truly holistic, grounded in principles of low power consumption, environmental responsibility, and anti-obsolescence, to ensure a sustainable future for Europes semiconductor industry. Regaining sovereignty over critical technologies is not optional but imperative to secure Europes future across AI, cybersecurity, embedded systems, HPC, real-time and safety-critical applications, advanced telecoms (6G to THz), and silicon photonics. Embracing sustainable innovation means minimizing energy use and environmental impact throughout semiconductor lifecycles, with proactive obsolescence management to extend device longevity, supporting Europes Green Deal and zero-carbon ambitions. Despite progress in Chips Act 1, Europe faces alarming and strategic gaps threatening competitiveness and autonomy, including lack of indigenous high-end GPUs, AI accelerators, lagging EDA toolchains, and deployment gaps at leading-edge nodes like 2 nm (which remains unfulfilled under Chips Act 1) and emerging transistor technologies such as CFETs, only forecast post-2032. The risk is existential: Europe is steadily losing control over key technological assets, worsened by dominance of non-European mobile and cloud ecosystems. Addressing this requires immediate, bold, and agile investment to close the gap with the US and Asia, stronger academia-industry partnerships, and large-scale initiatives to drive innovation and leadership. We propose Chips Act 2 fund and coordinate three pan-European flagship programs to secure Europes strategic autonomy: European Chiplet Initiative: Chiplets - modular, high-function semiconductor building blocks - overcome the limits of monolithic design by enabling scaling, yield enhancement, and flexible manufacturing. This initiative will establish a unified ecosystem and standardized framework to democratize chiplet-based heterogeneous systems design and assembly, fostering collaborative system-level research to integrate diverse functions rapidly. European GPU Initiative: GPUs and programmable accelerators power AI, HPC, real-time analytics, and immersive experiences. This initiative will provide agile access to pilot lines for academia and startups to accelerate prototyping of breakthrough high-end GPUs and AI accelerators. It targets angstrom-scale nodes, CFET transistors, 3D stacking, wafer-scale integration, and energy-efficient architectures, positioning Europe at the forefront of accelerator sovereignty. European EDA Initiative: EDA is the foundational gateway for integrated circuit design; without it, semiconductor manufacturing is futile. The EU must extend the Design Platform to emphasize system and design-technology co-optimization with robust IP-protected approaches ensuring global competitiveness. This initiative must extend beyond traditional boundaries to address the unprecedented complexities of chiplet- and 3D-integrated systems, handling millions of cores and multi-physics analyses (thermal, mechanical, electrical). By enabling agile co-optimization across device physics, packaging, and system-level functionality, it will accelerate innovation and consolidate sovereignty over critical design tools. Together, these flagship initiatives fill value chain gaps, drive excellence from research to production, and consolidate Europes semiconductor sovereignty amid fierce global competition. Success depends on deepened collaboration among academia, RTOs, industry, and policymakers - built on trustworthy, transparent partnerships fostering commitment, open idea exchange, and coordinated efforts to establish Europe as a resilient, cutting-edge semiconductor powerhouse.",

These technologies are essential for electrification, energy efficiency, and net-zero goals. We also urge the Commission to: 1. Recognize the importance of design software and simulation tools (like TCAD) in enabling innovation across the value chain 2. Ensure SMEs and startups can access infrastructure, IP, and training, not just large players 3. Promote UK-EU collaboration, especially in areas like power electronics where the UK has deep expertise and shared industrial goals We would welcome the opportunity to contribute further to this dialogue and collaborate with EU partners through REWIRE and other initiatives.",

Chip Act 2 is a great opportunity to strengthen the industrial and academic eco-system of the electronic sector in Europe. Compared to the initial Chip Act, this evolution should target the whole eco-system and not only the large upstream companies involved in the semiconductor conversion process. A mapping of the European electronics industry should be carried out in order to identify which sectors of the industries are the most dependent on non-European industries. To develop the sovereignty of the European industry, a special action program should support the local players in these identified sectors and EU should launch investments, research initiatives or other activities to be defined. In the field of the materials for the electronics industry, there are many sectors which could benefit support from EU : PCB, Epoxy Molding Compound, Soldering paste... End-users should be involved in such initiative since they own the performance requirements and thus are able to validate the relevancy of the technical solutions supported by EU considering the fast pace at which electronic products are developed.",

    "feedback": "Axis Communications began exploring chip design in the late 1980s, developing its first in-house chip, the ARTPEC SoC, in 1999. Chip development has fueled our innovation and growth ever since. As a successful European scale-up, we urge the EU to prioritize the following: 1. Build and retain semiconductor talent in the EU Semiconductor competence is essential for Europes resilience and competitiveness. Europe continues to face talent shortages, the loss of international talent, and a high dependency on non-European expertise. To strengthen long-term capabilities, the EU must support a functioning talent market with cross-border mobility and education aligned with industry needs. The focus should remain on digital system designincluding ASIC and IP developmentwhere Europe already demonstrates strong expertise. Maintaining skills in related areas such as PCB design is also important for sovereignty, but digital system design should stay the strategic priority. 2. Build a European design ecosystem for reusable IP and EDA tools To reduce dependency on non-European actors, the EU should prioritize the development of: - Reusable, EU-developed IP building blocks (e.g., CPUs, NPUs/AI accelerators) - European EDA tools, which are central to every stage of chip development Strengthening European IP and EDA capabilities is a highly cost-efficient way to build resilience and should precede investments in large-scale manufacturing. A coordinated European design ecosystem would accelerate competence building, ensure continuity of key technologies and help semiconductor scale-ups grow within Europe. It would also allow major industrial players to confidently select European providers, increasing overall autonomy in the value chain. 3. Enable high-TRL scale-up collaboration We see a need for a new type of EU structure that enables new innovative technology to be validated in real industrial environments that supports fast industrialization. Europe has many semiconductor research initiatives, but very few commercial scale-ups with proven chip design and mass-market deployment. Axis is one of the rare European companies that has scaled its own ASIC development into global products. Our experience has taught us that validating new innovative technology is crucial. It allows industrial actors to reduce risk and industrialize more quickly, which both are prerequisites for scalability. While Chips Act 1 focused heavily on low-TRL research projects and funding was shattered, Chips Act 2 must focus on deployment-focused, high-TRL pilot projects (close to industrialization). Today, small European innovators struggle to validate new technologies because semiconductor development is expensive, high-risk (and thus difficult to finance) and several areas are dominated by established suppliers. To change this dynamic we urge the EU to in the implementation of Chips Act 2 consider new formats for industrial collaboration where large industrial players act as requirement owners and advisors, academy and smaller companies can test and validate new technology. Such joint ventures would share risk and investment between companies, Member States and academia. While research programs exist today (e.g. Horizon Europe, Chips JU), there are few instruments that support high-TRL industrialization where large industry partners act as requirement owners and validators. This gap prevents European chip innovation from scaling. A flagship initiative could be a jointly specified EU Chip, where several industry partners define common requirements and validate the chip together, making EU technology testable, verifiable and scalable. In addition to technology validation, such industry-driven pilot projects would also improve supply chain transparency and ecosystem visibility, which the Commission identifies as a current gap. Such projects would also give the EU real-time insight into bottlenecks, talent needs and potential strategic dependencies.",

It will also need much-more European-led demand drivers: Software workloads by big EU players, Large-Language Models, Fintech software, etc all of which will generate more European buyers of chips from EU startups, for data-centers, robotics, infrastructure, fintech security, etc. Hopefully this essential collaboration across the stack (HW/SW/System/Application) will be a big focus of the upcoming EU DARE Digital Autonomy EU HPC Joint Undertaking. And finally - EU must waive or eliminate the UID Undertaking in Difficulty directive for Fabless Semi startups. All pre-revenue Fabless Semi's with heavy investment are by definition UID with significant negative balance-sheets.

    "feedback": "While the Chips Act with its many initiatives has already proven highly beneficial to spur new innovations or kindle tech transfers from academia to industry, as well as maintain critical support infrastructure such as EUROPRACTICE for EDA tools access, a number of areas could profit from further attention. 1) While there has been considerable progress has been made on the processor (mostly RISC-V) as well as AI accelerator side of hardware IP blocks, what is still sorely missing are European (ideally open-source) high-speed I/O blocks for crucial interfaces such as PCI Express and DDR DRAM. As such IP, critical to actually realize computing _systems_, is currently only available from Asian and US suppliers, its lack is a key weakness in European digital sovereignty. 2) The lack of open PDKs for competitive, more modern processes (sub-90nm), preferably for technologies actually fabricated in Europe, is complicating research, education, as well as the entry of innovative SMEs into the market due to the large paperwork effort and long delays associated with getting access to proprietary PDKs. If possible, the Chips Act should provide support to entities creating open-access / open-source PDKs (including complete standard cell libraries), similar to the way Google sponsored creating the open PDK for Skywater 130nm in the US. 3) The current funding scheme of just 70% for academic partners in many of the Chips JU programs makes it very difficult to contribute expertise to the programs. The argument, that the indirect costs can be used to make-up for the underfunding is not generally valid, as in many cases University central admin cashes in these monies, leaving the actual research groups struggling themselves on how to cover the actual costs. This even applies to the JU programs that _do_ cover 100% from the EU side, as national funding organizations tend to still play games with their contribution, which, combined with the tendency of central admin to take a cut of all incoming funds, still leads to underfunding at the researcher level. It would be highly recommended that the EU clarifies to the national partners (and institutional central admin) that 100% means _100% actually available at the researcher level_.",

Nevertheless, these efforts must now be extended to PCB and PCBA industry (chips dont float). The European PCB industry is very fragile and has decreased considerably in the last 20 years. Today, a very significant portion of global PCB production is concentrated in Asia. By encouraging the development of this industry in Europe, the EU Chips Act 2.0 would help reduce this dependence, secure the supply chain of strategic electronic components and also help R&D development to insure competitiveness and anticipation of future needs. European space industry has developed strong skills and experience for high reliability board assembly to comply with severe environmental requirements. But the increasing power dissipation and density of I/Os in new strategic components induce a need for improving the thermal and mechanical management in the assembly of packages to PCBs. Supporting the PCB and assembly industry under the EU Chips Act 2.0 will be a strategic measure that strengthens technological sovereignty, reduces external dependencies, stimulates innovation and create jobs. It is therefore essential to include thoses sectors in the action plans priorities.",

Chips and PCBs (without printed circuit board chips would be useless) suitable for the harsh space environment are indispensable for European spacecraft for Earth Observation, Telecommunications, Navigation, Science, Exploration and Security. Space microchips are made with ¨commercial¨(non-space) microchip technologies and manufacturers but require specific and expensive additional design, manufacturing and qualification efforts and resources. Since 2000 the European Space Components Coordination (ESCC) boards and working groups are defining roadmaps of actions on multiple space microelectronics technology areas. ESCC collects needs and development priorities from all European space agencies, components manufacturers and space industry. The goal is to ensure availability and sustainability of competitive space microchip technology and products in Europe, minimising dependence with USA and Asian suppliers. ESA´s space EEE Components Sovereignty initiative is a recent example of how ESA is requesting higher funds to all its member states to further develop and improve the European space microelectronics ecosystem. ESCC and ESA are coordinating efforts and common goals with European Commission DG-DEFIS and the European Defence Agency, and it would be great if ESA and ESCC roadmaps, needs and priorities for space microchips would be taken into account by the Chips JU and the new in the making EU Chips Act 2.0. We all see the EU Chips Act 1.0 and now 2.0 as an incredible opportunity and necessary step to: - put more resources into all the space microelectronics goals mentioned above, helping to cover the special needs of the microchips for the SPACE sector in Europe - increase the European pool of experts in these highly specialised fields - reduce dependence on non-European suppliers, especially in ¨critical technologies¨ for ¨critical applications¨ that rely on space systems. The main microelectronics technology areas where the European space community (agencies, fabless-vendors, manufacturers, industry) would much appreciate support from the EU Chips Act 1.0 and 2.0: Silicon: Ultra-Deep Sub-micron (UDSM) for ASICs, FPGAs, microprocessors => 28, 22 and 7nm ; IP Cores ; chiplets, advanced heterogeneous packaging (2D , 2.5D, 3D SiP) GaN for power ; power ICs Photonics: Transceivers ; components for Quantum Apps ; PICs Detectors CIS ; High end IR ; High end VI ; High end CCD ; Read-Out ICs Microwave: GaN for HF ; SiGe or Si IC ; Packaging Passives: RLC ; Energy & Power ; cable assemblies ; oscillators RF Passives: Integrated micro passives ; switches ; RF connectors Hybrids & Packaging Non hermetic ; High speed / High freq. / power / photonics =>> SiP PCB & SMT: Supply chain ; Base materials ; High density ; HDR & High freq. / Power Mngt Radiation assurance: Improve models ; New components ; Methodology ; Need of new facilities Reference documents and sites: ESA EEE Component Sovereignty Initiative - ACCEDE-ESCCON March 2025 (link in attachment) ESCC Components Technology Board - roadmaps overview 2025 (link in attachment) ESCC Components Technology Board Roadmaps 2025 (pdf in attachment) ESCC (European Space Components Coordination) (link in attachment)",

    "feedback": "As a scientific researcher and university educator, I would like to provide a brief analysis in response to the EU Chips Act review consultation [1]. My views are based on four main hypotheses that align with the replies of the European Commission to the European Court of Auditors 12/2025 report [2, 3]. 1.- Chips are not alone. Other technologies, such as computer programming, are necessary for chips to function properly in solving citizens' problems. A significant percentage of the demand for chips is due to the creation or existence of software. Software is what ultimately automates the solution of problems for citizens, companies, institutions, etc. It is also necessary to invest in the software that makes chips work to solve problems. An obvious example is Artificial Intelligence software applications, such as those integrated into autonomous vehicle driving. 2.- More intercontinental cooperation is needed. I believe that the term sovereignty is inappropriate because it distracts from real opportunities. It is unlikely that Europe will achieve absolute independence in the chip supply chain in the short or medium term [2]. Therefore, strategic alliances with other experienced players outside Europe are needed to respond to future chip supply crises. These alliances must be established from the strongest possible strategic position. One way to achieve such a position of strength could be the creation of a European Chip Agency. This agency could not only implement and coordinate the economic management of European investment in chip manufacturing infrastructure but also manage and implement the main strategies for chip research, development, and manufacturing in Europe. It could also play a key role in establishing intercontinental relations with Europe. A precursor to this potential agency could be the Europractice consortium [4], a successor to Eurochip (1989-1995). Europractice already receives funding from the European Union's Chips Joint Undertaking. 3. More services to improve the efficiency of existing chips. Chip manufacturing may not be economically viable in Europe due to insufficient demand to make investments profitable. The limited size and fragmentation of European chip demand across different types of chips means that producing at scale for the European market alone will be very difficult [5]. However, other solutions are possible, such as providing services that optimise the use of new or existing infrastructure in times of shortage. In other words, rather than producing new chips, we could reuse and increase the efficiency of existing ones. For instance, strategies involving refurbishing used chips and providing software services, such as reducing the 'instruction footprint' to optimise their use long after their manufacture date, could alleviate a potential temporary shortage [6]. 4. Fundamental and applied research and training for professionals must be strengthened and guided by the technology industry's demands. Research and training centres should be located closer to industries, rather than the other way around. To this end, industries and Research & Education centres should be concentrated in parts of Europe that have already been named 'technological valleys' [7].

Much of the work carried out by myself and by my research group has been possible thanks to the Europractice initiative, which has provided access to professional design tools and semiconductor technologies. More recently, with support from the PNRR and CHIPS-IT, we successfully completed a RISC-Vbased tapeout in October 2025. In my opinion, further European initiatives aimed at supporting chip design are essential to sustain innovation in this strategic domain. Moreover, the recent push toward open-source tools and technologies is offering new and promising perspectives for microelectronics research in Europe. Finally, I believe that sustained support is essential for maintaining European competitiveness, enabling universities, research centers, and small and medium-sized enterprises to innovate, and helping train the next generation of chip designers. Continued investment in multi-project wafer access, open-source and professional EDA tools, and advanced-node availability would significantly strengthen Europes strategic autonomy in semiconductors.",

At ChipsWIN (the Walloon Chips Competence Centre), we think that SME's and startups are an essential part in reviving the semiconductors in Europe. They will provide the local anchoring which big players fail to provide as they consider their playing fields as the global market. In our consultations we have seen that SME's and startups experience high (financial / investments) thresholds when wanting to bring an innovation to the market. Solutions are needed enabling a ramp-up from few prototypes as pilot-lines and RTO's may support, to larger numbers necessary to convince bigger players to adopt / support the innovative process or design. Access to shared infrastructures allowing SME's or startups to run proprietary processing or testing for a time at a limited cost is seen as an important enabler.",

    "feedback": "I welcome the EU's initiative to review and strengthen the Chips Act. While the regulation has already demonstrated significant impact, there is a critical gap that needs to be addressed to achieve true technological sovereignty: comprehensive support for chip design training, research infrastructure, and experimental validation capabilities within the EU. The EU's semiconductor strategy needs to prioritise the development of highly skilled designers and researchers. The Chips Act should include dedicated provisions for industry-aligned training programmes that equip professionals and researchers with practical chip design expertise, as well as collaborative initiatives between academia and industry to ensure training reflects current technological demands. Most importantly, dedicated funding schemes for institutes active in IC and chip design are essential. Current funding mechanisms often fail to adequately support research institutions engaged in IC design activities. This is perhaps the critical gap in the current framework. Many funding calls are not specifically targeted at the fabrication and experimental validation phases of chip design. For many designers and researchers, these stages are not supported by their host institutions, creating a significant barrier to innovation. I strongly advocate for the inclusion of a dedicated scheme within the revised Chips Act that specifically covers fabrication costs for prototype and experimental chips, testing and characterisation expenses, multi-project wafer access, and post-fabrication analysis and evaluation. This support is particularly crucial for advanced microsystems, including RFICs, AI-centric chip architectures, and emerging sensor systems, which will form the foundations of the future digital economy and societal advancements, as well as critical national sectors such as defence, automotive, robotics, and telecommunications. The IHP Open PDK pilot programme has demonstrated a successful model that should be expanded and institutionalised within the Chips Act. This initiative has shown that providing accessible design tools and fabrication support enables broader participation in chip design research, faster innovation cycles, and reduced barriers for academic and small-scale research projects. I have personally benefited from the existence of such a scheme, through which one of my projects on the design of next-generation on-chip beamforming systems (as attached) has been approved and is being fabricated. I hope the Act will facilitate ongoing budget allocation to keep this initiative active and, where possible, expand and scale it. By incorporating dedicated provisions for chip design training, research funding, and experimental fabrication support, the EU can develop a resilient, innovative semiconductor ecosystem that reduces strategic dependencies and positions the EU as a global leader in advanced chip technologies.",

    "feedback": "My Background: I have been teaching for many years on microelectronics and we have submitted close to 80 different designs over the years in several different technologies, therefore I have been deeply involved in the topic. Access to Chip Design Tools and to Chip Fabrication via Europractice was fundamental for universities to support good and applied teaching in microelectronics, as well as for 'real' chip designs for research projects. In order to help Europe to maintain and improve chip design know-how, it is mandatory to further provide a structure, support and funding for this. Many things went well within Europractice, but the upcoming changes should be used as an opportunity to improve the situation. From my experience, I see at least 4 areas for improvement: 1. The chips submission (tapeout) procedure was often slow, with unnecessary delays, and information exchange was very difficult. A web site where the status of each design can be monitored would improve the situation a lot. Final DRCs were slow by shipping files back and forth by email and by not giving the final DRC decks to end users. This could be streamlined a lot. 2. Running the EDA software required hardware and IT personell for software and design kit installation. Such positions are very difficult to establish and fill at universities so that it can be difficult to maintain a running design infrastructure. A cloud based solution would simplify this A LOT and would give much easier access to more technology options (as they do not need to be installed locally). Also, compute hardware would be more powerful. As heavy hardware is often only required temporarily (for large simulations or checks), it would be much more efficient to share hardware. Cost for this could be partially charged to universities because we save own hardware and personnel. 3. It has been hard or impossible to get technical support on technologies for more tricky questions, because the experts sitting at the vendors are often shielded from University users. A help desk for such questions would improve the situation a lot and avoid unnecessary mistakes. One possibility to implement this is to support university groups, who have deep experience in a particular topic, to act as a help desk for this topic. This would require (limited) financial support and in particular coordination of such expert access. We at Heidelberg could for instance provide support for technologies we know very well. 4. Legal issues (access to software, NDAs for design kits) becomes more and more complicated and a lot of time gets lost with paperwork. While being unavoidable, the rules should be make very clear and as much support as possible should be given, for instance with a centralised collection of NDAs for each person, a mechanism to prolong or cancel NDA etc.",

Between the semiconductor and the finished product lies a crucial gap one where Europe is still heavily dependent on Asia: the PCB and PCBA sector. In this area, Asian manufacturers not only dominate in terms of volume, but in many cases also set the benchmark for technological capability and production efficiency. Europe, on the other hand, still struggles to scale up and compete in advanced, high-density PCB technologies. To truly strengthen Europes position in electronics, we need a holistic approach that covers the entire value chain from semiconductor design and manufacturing to PCB production, assembly, testing, and system integration. Only by reinforcing every step of this process can Europe build a resilient and competitive electronics ecosystem. DSI Aerospace supports the EU Chips Act and proposes the outlined expansion of its scope to secure Europes supply resilience and technological independence.",

    "feedback": "Europes semiconductor ecosystem is strongest when it reflects the diversity of its people, regions and institutions. Across the Union, many smaller universities, technical faculties, SMEs and specialised labs contribute essential expertise, train the next generation of engineers and address high-mix, low-volume industrial needs that are central to Europes identity and global competitiveness. These actors are not peripheral. They are part of the core that keeps innovation grounded and connected to real problems, real products and real regional ecosystems. Chips Act 2 is an opportunity to strengthen this inclusive model. However, the current implementation tends to concentrate funding, visibility and strategic influence within a small group of large incumbent RTOs and major industrial players. These organisations have value, but over-reliance on them risks creating a narrow and unbalanced system where smaller universities and SMEs become passengers rather than contributors. This dynamic limits innovation capacity, reduces geographical cohesion and weakens Europes ability to cultivate new talent and new ideas. A more resilient and sovereign Europe requires a broader base. Smaller academic institutions often provide the first contact with microelectronics for students. They are also the ones closest to regional industries that rely on customised, specialised solutions rather than commodity scale. Their contribution is vital for sectors such as automotive, aerospace, energy, medical devices and scientific equipment, where Europe remains strong precisely because it embraces complexity rather than mass production. Supporting this long-tail segment of the ecosystem is not a sentimental choice. It is a strategic necessity. Chips Act 2 should therefore ensure that smaller universities, SMEs and regional centres have direct, fair access to design tools, pilot lines, prototyping and collaborative projects without needing to be filtered exclusively through large RTOs. Public investment in major industrial facilities should be accompanied by clear expectations for cooperation with the wider education and innovation landscape. Europe will only achieve technological sovereignty if capacity building is genuinely distributed and if opportunities for hands-on participation reach every part of the continent. Europes challenge is to find a shared foundation despite the diversity of twenty-seven Member States and the broader European scientific community. That diversity can be our strength if the Chips Act reflects it. We should aim for a unifying, positive moment where every participant feels included in Europes technological future. Chips Act 2 is a chance to build such a moment by recognising that innovation does not come only from scale or incumbency, but from the collective energy of many institutions working together to make things function reliably and responsibly. Europe does not need to imitate global models built on consolidation and uniformity. Our path forward lies in embracing what makes us different and letting every capable contributor take part. That is how Chips Act 2 can create lasting value and a semiconductor ecosystem that Europe can be proud of.",

    "feedback": "I welcome the opportunity to provide input to DG CONNECT regarding the ongoing implementation and future evolution of the EU Chips Act. I would like to express strong support for the objectives of the Act and specifically to acknowledge the significant progress already achieved under Pillar 1. The establishment of the EU Pilot Lines will substantially strengthen Europes semiconductor research and innovation ecosystem, enabling advanced prototyping, accelerating technology readiness, and supporting industrial uptake. Likewise, the creation of National Competence Centressuch as Irelands I-C3will deliver essential technical capabilities, training resources, and shared infrastructure that support start-ups and SMEs across the Union. Building on these achievements, a key structural constraint must be addressed to fully realise the impact of the Chips Act: the acute shortage of skilled personnel in integrated circuit (IC) design and semiconductor manufacturing. Despite strong ecosystem growth, the supply of graduates, engineers, and researchers remains significantly below current and projected industrial demand. Given DG CONNECTs mission to strengthen Europes microelectronic leadership, digital autonomy, and support for strategic technologies, resolving this skills gap must be a central priority for the next phase of the Chips Act. Addressing this constraint is also essential to enhance Europes future connectivity and AI capabilities. The following measures are recommended: 1. Strengthening Semiconductor Education Pathways DG CONNECT should support Member States and universities in expanding dedicated IC design and microelectronics pathways within engineering programmes. Recommended measures include: a. Funding to develop focused undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in IC design and semiconductor technology. b. Modernising laboratory and teaching infrastructure. c. Ensuring broad access to state-of-the-art electronic design automation (EDA) tools. d. Providing funding for undergraduate tape-outs to deliver authentic design-to-silicon experience. e. Developing micro-credentials aligned with industry needs. f. Establishing higher-level apprenticeships co-developed by universities and industry partners. These initiatives will significantly improve student preparedness, increase the attractiveness of semiconductor careers, and support DG CONNECTs aims in digital capacity-building and technological sovereignty. 2. Expanding Europes Research and Innovation Base Sustained support for PhD training and postdoctoral research is critical to maintain Europes long-term innovation capacity. Expanded funding streams would: a. Enable research groups to grow and strengthen European semiconductor research. b. Attract and retain global talent. c. Foster multi-disciplinary teams at the intersection of IC design, semiconductor manufacturing, AI applications (cloud, edge, and physical systems), and advanced communications technologies. These capabilities align directly with DG CONNECTs strategic priorities, including next-generation computing, AI hardware, and secure connected systems, and can leverage existing infrastructure such as pilot lines and National Competence Centres. 3. Supporting Talent Retention in the EU Given global competition for semiconductor expertise, DG CONNECT could encourage Member States to consider targeted tax incentives or equivalent retention mechanisms for graduates entering the European semiconductor sector. Such measures would help retain talent and support the sustainable growth of Europes semiconductor workforce. Collectively, these actions will enhance the effectiveness of investments made under Pillar 1, strengthen Europes semiconductor talent pipeline, and ensure long-term strategic autonomy and competitiveness in microelectronics. I thank DG CONNECT for the opportunity to contribute to this consultation and fully support the continuing development of the Chips Act.",

Industry strongly supports Member States call for an ambitious revision of the Chips Act to revitalise Europes semiconductor ecosystem. The Semiconductor Declarations three strategic priorities prosperity, indispensability, resilience provide a solid foundation for this renewed ambition. Europes objective cannot be self-sufficiency but must be indispensability: becoming a global leader that the world relies on for critical technologies, skills and innovation. Europe should invest where it already holds a competitive edge or can realistically catch up. For this, a centralised EU financing instrument for strategic semiconductor projects is essential to boost the EUs future competitiveness and security.

    "feedback": "The geopolitical changes of recent years make it imperative to rethink the future role of micro- and nanoelectronics (MNE) in the EU and the member states. The reasons for this are: - Massively increasing dependence of all major vertical markets (automotive, medical, and space) on micro- and nanoelectronics (MNE). - Impending trade restrictions and even trade wars, leading to strategic dependencies on non-European suppliers of micro- and nanoelectronics and threatening the existence of industry in the EU and their menber states. - Deficits in the implementation of digitalization and the use of AI in administration, industry, security, energy efficiency, and defense. MNE is essential in eliminating these deficits. - Military threats to the EU member states from aggressors with conventional, nuclear, and hybrid warfare capabilities. Without significant efforts in the areas mentioned, the EU risks losing their self-determination. Prosperity, freedom, democracy, and peace are at risk. Micro- and nanoelectronics provide the technologies that permeate all areas of life and form the backbone of modern societies, all industries, and military defense. The EU Chips Act 1 was a big step forward into the right direction and many industrial investments startet already and are in the realization phase. For the R&D organisations the Pilot Lines of Chips Act 1 secure relevant research with up to date equipment. Chip Act 1 focused in the pilotlines mainly on CAPEX. A future Chips Act 2 should focuse on OPEX funding in order to activate the invests in the equipment for research and innovation which was purchased in Chips Act 1. The EU needs a R&D infrastructures and Pilot Lines that are capable of supporting and enabling the following tasks: - Reducing strategic dependencies and building technological capabilities that secure competitiveness in the global digital economy. - Developing value-oriented services that continue to enable citizens to live in freedom and digital self-determination. - Developing resilient technologies for effective and efficient military and civil security. The future EU strategy within Chips Act 2 should not only focus on production numbers (20% target) but even more on critical issues in the world wide semiconductor value chains. This must include advanced packaging and system aspects. Important technologies such as AI and next-generation computing (neuromorphic computing, quantum computing), new memories, optoelectronics, power electronics, high-frequency electronics, and micro systems must be covered and represented. R&D organisations suffered in the past increasingly from the EU funding conditions: The real effective project costs of modern equipped R&D infrastructures cause high overhead costs well beyond the actual funding rates. This problem is amplified by the fact that more and more national cofunding authorities copy the EU rules on funding and eligibility. As a consequence, the best equipped R&D organisations run in a financial disaster if they acquire to much EU projects. This cannot be in the intention of the EU. Additionally, we need more flexibilty in the eligibility of costs. If we start e.g. with the procurement of consumables just with the project start we often get them much too late. If we start before, cost will not be covered. Finally we suggest to focus research, development and innovation in the Chips Act 2 on the intensive use of the Chips Act 1 Pilot Lines. Double funding and national parallel actions should be avoided.",

In Asia we are beginning to see a very strong development of cable printed circuit boards (PCBs + PCBAs), which suggest that the added value of the electronic function will be mounted. This strategy, which we have seen on telephony or solar panels that are now almost entirely manufactured in Asia, is likely to be repeated.

    "feedback": "Buongiorno, vorrei unire il mio commento ai molti che immagino abbiate già ricevuto sullargomeno. Il Chips Act così come concepito mostra delle gravi lacune in quanto non tiene conto della intera catena di approvvigionamento del settore. E inutile promuovere lo sviluppo di una industria del semiconduttore europea se mancano poi il prima e il dopo per poter avere una intera filiera dellelettronica in Europa. La mia azienda opera nel settore della produzione del circuito stampato (PCB) che è lelemento sul quale i vari chips elettronici vengono montati. Senza circuito stampato non si produce elettronica. Il settore del PCB è stato martoriato negli ultimi ventanni in Europa a causa sia di una concorrenza cinese spietata, ma anche da folli leggi europee che gravano di tasse di importazione da extra UE i materiali di base necessari alla produzione di PCB, mentre offrono zero dazi ai PCB finiti in arrivo dalla Cina. Questa situazione paradossale ha di fatto distrutto il tessuto produttivo del PCB in Europa con un numero di aziende passato da oltre 1000 nellanno 2000 alle circa 150 di oggi. Più della metà dei PCB venduti in Europa oggi vengono dalla Cina. Questo è non solo inaccettabile, ma strategicamente folle nel momento che si vogliono investire miliardi nella produzione di chips in Europa. E necessario che lEuropa si doti di tutta la filiera di produzione dellelettronica, dai circuiti stampati ai chips fino allassemblaggio finale. Senza la catena completa i miliardi spesi per i chips non serviranno a nulla e lEuropa rimarrà sempre schiava delle potenze industriali asiatiche. Quindi si chiede di ampliare il Chips Act inserendo modifiche che possano mettere in moto anche un ripopolamento delle aziende produttrici di PCB europee e questo può solo cominciare dalla eliminazione della assurda stortura dei dazi doganali sui materiali di base. Servono assolutamente per cominciare: - La eliminazione dei dazi doganali sui materiali di base che servono per la produzione di PCB almeno fino a che anche detti materiali possano essere di nuovo prodotti in Europa - Limposizione di dazi sui PCB finiti in arrivo dalla Cina, in modo da limitare il vasto fenomeno del brokeraggio che sta letteralmente ammazzando il tessuto industriale del PCB in Europa. Ovviamente le stesse attenzioni e agevolazioni che il Chips Act rivolge alle aziende produttrici di semiconduttori, dovranno essere indirizzate anche verso aziende esistenti e nuove di PCB.

    "feedbackTextUserLanguage": "Good day, I would like to bring my comment together with the many who imagine you have already received this argument. The Chips Act as designed shows serious shortcomings as it does not take into account the entire supply chain of the industry. It is pointless to promote the development of a European semiconductor industry if there is a lack of the first and the next in order to have an entire electronics industry in Europe. My company is active in the production of the printed circuit board (PCB), which is a leachment on which the various electronic chips are assembled. No electronic production is made without a printed circuit board. The PCB sector has been blamed in the last two decades in Europe due to both fierce Chinese competition, as well as European laws imposing import taxes from outside the EU on the basic materials needed to produce PCBs, while offering zero duties to finished PCBs arriving from China. This paradoxical situation has in fact destroyed the production fabric of PCBs in Europe, with the number of companies going from over 1000 in 2000 to around 150 today. More than half of the PCBs sold in Europe today come from China. This is not only unacceptable, but strategically crowded as billions are to be invested in the production of chips in Europe. Europe needs to equip itself with the entire electronics production chain, from printed circuit boards to chips and final allassembling. Without the full chain, the billions spent on chips will not serve anything and Europe will always be squeezed by Asian industrial powers. We therefore call for the Chips Act to be extended to include changes that could also bring about a restocking of European PCBs companies. This can only begin with the elimination of the absurd stunning of customs duties on basic materials. It is absolutely necessary to start: — The elimination of customs duties on basic materials used for the production of PCBs at least as long as these materials can also be produced again in Europe – the clearance of duties on finished PCBs arriving from China, so as to limit the widespread phenomenon of brokering which is literally blurring the industrial fabric of PCBs in Europe. Obviously, the same attention and facilitation as the Chips Act addresses semiconductor companies, will also have to be directed towards existing and new PCBs companies. Thank you for your assistance and remain at your disposal for any further information you may require. Yours faithfully, Gaetano DallOra Managing Director Dallco Sas + 39.346.5021288",

Europe has just a small share for PCB´s used in Europe. Generally the share of Europe is below 2% worldwide. We urgently need to improve the resilience of our system, not only with regard to transmitted PCB data that could be misused for negative purposes, but also in terms of supply chain reliability. => We have to further invest into the entire supply chain - especially in PCB´s. In addition: - European PCB manufacturers pay high duties on essential base materials, which are not sufficiently produced in the EU. - Finished PCBs imported from China, however, are duty-free creating unfair competition. - Exempt base materials such as copper laminates, epoxy resin prepregs, and FR4 from customs duties. - Europe is investing in chips whereas the USA is investing in chips and additionally PCB - => Requirement of additional PCB investment Without targeted support for Europes PCB industry through customs relief, investment incentives, and IP protection the European Chip Act remains incomplete. Chips always need PCBs, and Europes security depends on a strong domestic PCB sector.",

    "feedback": "The EU can learn from its experience with classical semiconductors, where outsourcing production led to a loss of capabilities. The quantum sector presents an opportunity for Europe to establish itself as a leader and avoid repeating past mistakes. While academic research has been ongoing for decades, commercialization is still in its infancy, and no company has yet fully scaled up production to mature levels. The current focus on building quantum pilot lines for research and development is essential, but it must be accompanied by a clear plan for industrialization at the EU level. Quantum chip fabrication being a novel area of technology, the race is on to ramp it up to mature production level. Quantum, including R&D grade low volume and low integration level chip fabrication, has been a topic of academic research for decades. While the pilot lines which are being built will make the bar lower for start-ups to test their technology, the roadmap of established quantum companies requires production sites. The emergence of quantum chip fabrication presents a global opportunity for regions to establish themselves as production for quantum technology. Europe can capitalize on this trend by creating an attractive environment for quantum companies to set up production sites. To achieve the EU's goal of acquiring systems that can deliver 100 error-corrected qubits by 2030, comprehensive support for chip fabrication is necessary. This plan should focus on establishing a scalable public-private manufacturing infrastructure, with dedicated funding instruments for European startups, scale-ups and SMEs developing quantum chips. A key challenge in quantum chip manufacturing is the transition from laboratory to commercial production. The production of superconducting quantum processors uses traditional semiconductor manufacturing techniques, but with unique materials and structures rendering conventional semiconductor fabrication lines incompliant. To accelerate the transition from laboratory to commercial production, it's essential to have a dedicated set of production tools readily available for start-ups and scale-ups. The Chips Act introduced a series of mechanisms to bolster semiconductor innovation and manufacturing in Europe, notably through Pillar 2. However, Pillar 2 was not designed with the unique requirements of quantum manufacturing in mind, which limits its effectiveness in this emerging domain. While Pillar 2 has laid a foundation for innovation, quantum manufacturing demands a more targeted and faster approach.",

    "feedback": "The European PCB industry is only covering 1.9% of all the PCBs made worldwide. Since the late nineties this industry has shrunk by approx 75%. The recent initiatives like Chip Acts in the USA and EU are encouraging. However, Chips don't float. They are mounted on PCBs and IC Substrates (carriers) in order to perform. Also, there is a growing demand for embedding Chip alike functionality inside the carriers for miniaturisation. There are therefore crucial elements of our every day lives in Europe to be named for basically every type of industry applying PCBs and IC Substrates. With approx 180 PCB factories remaining in the EU & UK, this industry has achieved, and perhaps gone beyond, its required critical mass in order to keep European industries and most of all independance secured. All existing companies in this field should be saluted as they have all relentlessly continued to fight for their existance, without reachng out for help. However, the majority of this this technology is now for approx 59.8% in the hands of China alone. The US accounts for 3% but mainly lower technology and the rest is divided by other Asian countries, and currently a huge new capacity being under construction in south east Asia. This industry in Europe is not going to have to or want to grow to 10 or more percent, but if it will become even smaller, it will disappear within the ext 10 years. Especially with the energy transition and critical industries like medical, Life Science, Space, Industrial and recently growing demand for Defence will 100% rely on \"Made in Europe\". The raw material already come for 100% from outside Europe. This is even seeing import taxes, whereas Asian manufacturers can export to Europe the finished product, without any import duties. It is wrong and needs to be fixed Yesterday! Without this industry present in a healthy manner, Europe will be losing its strength in the world. The solutions are to be found in the aforementioned shift on import duties to finshed Asian products and scrapped for raw material. Regulations for building and investing should be closely discussed.",

    "feedback": "Identifying a Critical Dependency for European Sovereignty Nomenil B.V. is a Dutch technology SME (KvK 98077635) developing a data-driven software platform (N-1) to solve the core process-control bottleneck in Functional Additive Manufacturing (AM). Our initial focus is enabling the high-volume, high-accuracy production of advanced Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). We strongly support the strategic goals of the Chips Act. However, we submit this evidence to highlight a critical dependency that must be addressed in the \"Chips Act 2\" to ensure the Acts ultimate success: Technological sovereignty in leading-edge semiconductor chips is functionally impossible without parallel sovereignty in the advanced packaging and substrate value chain. The Problem: The \"Artisanal\" Bottleneck in Advanced Packaging The review correctly identifies that the EU is dependent on non-EU countries for leading-edge chips (Problem 1) and that \"advanced packaging, test and assembly\" (Pillar 2) is a key focus. The problem is that these two issues are inseparable. Advanced chips require equally advanced, high-density interconnects and substrates (like PCBs), which cannot be manufactured reliably with current methods. The promise of Additive Manufacturing (e.g., inkjet technology) to deliver this capability has failed, not due to the equipment, but due to the process. The current \"artisanal\" R&D methoda manual, non-scalable, trial-and-error processis incapable of guaranteeing the required process reproducibility (e.g., 25µm accuracy over large areas). This process failure is the primary innovation bottleneck blocking the EUs strategic sectors (defence, automotive, space) from adopting flexible, localized PCB production. It creates a critical dependency on non-EU supply chains for complex substrates, mirroring the dependency in the chips themselves. Our Contribution: Enabling Pillar 2 and Strengthening the Ecosystem As a European technology provider, our N-1 platform directly addresses this bottleneck. We do not manufacture chips or PCBs; we provide the enabling process knowledge that makes advanced manufacturing scalable and reliable. Enabling Advanced Packaging (Pillar 2): The N-1 platform replaces \"artisanal\" R&D with a systematic, data-driven calibration framework. It allows manufacturers to generate Digital Correction Profilesa scalable, verifiable form of Process IP. This is the \"knowledge in a box\" that finally delivers the 25µm accuracy and reliability required for the high-density interconnects that advanced chips depend on. Strengthening Supply Chain Resilience (Pillar 1 & 3): By solving the process bottleneck, our solution enables a secure, decentralized, and flexible European supply chain for advanced PCBs. This is vital for the \"strategic sectors\" that require low-volume, high-mix, and secure components without relying on non-EU, high-volume fabs. Strengthening the Entire EU Value Chain: The current artisanal support burden is unsustainable, not just for the PCB manufacturers (the \"pioneers\") but also for the (often European) capital equipment suppliers. Our platform removes this burden, liberating equipment suppliers to focus on innovation rather than costly, non-scalable manual support. Our solution is an ecosystem enabler, turning potential competitors into allies focused on a common goal. Recommendation for \"Chips Act 2\" Review We urge the Commission to ensure the review and subsequent \"Chips Act 2\" explicitly recognize that \"advanced packaging\" and \"substrate manufacturing\" are fundamental dependencies, not just secondary considerations. The Act must expand its focus to include support for the enabling process technologieslike data-driven calibration and process IP generation frameworksthat unlock this critical part of the value chain. By investing in the process, the EU can finally secure the entire ecosystem, from substrate to chip, and deliver on the full promise of technological sovereignty.",

    "feedback": "The European Unions Chips Act has been a pivotal step in fostering semiconductor innovation, enhancing resilience, and securing the future of the regions digital economy. However, for the EU to achieve its goals of technological sovereignty and global competitiveness, it is critical to recognize the interdependent nature of semiconductor manufacturing with other foundational components of modern electronics. Among these, Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBAs) play a vital yet often underappreciated role in the broader semiconductor ecosystem. Their inclusion in the Chips Act 2.0 is not only logical but also essential for creating a robust, self-sustaining electronic supply chain within the EU. Incentives for European PCB and PCBA manufacturers should be introduced to encourage local production, reduce costs, and ensure that European companies are not dependent on foreign suppliers for these critical components. Establishing a strong PCB/PCBA manufacturing base is essential for the long-term health of Europes electronics industry. A good example of how local PCB procurement is discouraged today is the current custom duties regulation. The base materials (resin impregnated glass fibers, Copper clads,) needed to manufacture PCBs on EU soil are produced mainly in SEA. The PCB manufacturers need to pay custom duties on these essential base materials ranging between 5 and 7%. PCBs manufactured in China and imported into the EU are exempt from custom duties leading to an unleveled playing field and competitive disadvantage that discourages local EU fabrication of PCB. The defense, space, and aviation sectors are among the most critical industries in the world, involving technologies that are essential to national security, technological leadership, and global competitiveness. At the heart of these technologies are Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), which serve as the backbone for the electrical systems that power advanced defense equipment, spacecraft, and aerospace vehicles. These industries rely on highly specialized, high-performance PCBs that must meet stringent reliability and safety standards. Given the strategic importance of these sectors, it is crucial that PCBs for defense, space, and aviation applications must be produced within the EU. Doing so is necessary not just for technological and industrial independence, but also to protect critical know-how, security, and innovation. Through the Chips Act 2.0, the EU should also further allocate funds for research into next-generation PCB and PCBA technologies, such as HDI, high-frequency, flexible, and eco-friendly boards. This will allow European manufacturers to lead in the development of innovative solutions that can address future needs in emerging sectors. Beside the capability development through R&D, capacity-oriented initiatives and workforce development initiatives will be essential in order to develop a robust electronic ecosystyem. Only by fully integrating the entire ecosystem (including semiconductors, PCBs, and PCBAs) can Europe truly build a resilient, competitive, and future-proof technological infrastructure for the decades to come.",

    "feedback": "The evaluation of the current Chips Act presents an important opportunity to strengthen Europes strategic semiconductor capacity while maintaining democratic governance, transparency, and long-term resilience. Based on my participation in several EU digital-policy consultations, I would offer the following observations. First, the Acts strategic intent is sound, but implementation mechanisms remain uneven. Europe has made progress in research excellence, yet the translation from laboratory outcomes to industrial scale remains fragmented. Public instruments should more clearly support open-access testbeds, shared pilot lines, and interoperable intellectual-property frameworks that allow SMEs and start-ups to participate without disproportionate barriers. Industrial participation needs to be measurable, transparent, and linked to clear technology-readiness milestones. Second, supply-chain security requires a more principle-based and diversified approach. Current dependency patterns in critical materials, equipment, and upstream intellectual property remain a structural vulnerability. The revision should explicitly incorporate multi-region redundancy, trusted-partner verification, and cross-border risk-sharing mechanisms that align with Europes broader quantum, cybersecurity, and space-communication strategies. Coordination with IRIS² and the Quantum Act will be essential for end-to-end secure semiconductor-enabled infrastructure. Third, governance and interoperability require stronger alignment. The Chips Act should avoid parallel, uncoordinated programmes by embedding a coherent oversight structure that brings together Member States, industry, research organisations, and civil society. A periodic review cycletransparent, evidence-based, and linked to emerging riskswould support stable long-term investment conditions while safeguarding democratic accountability. Fourth, talent development remains a decisive bottleneck. Europes long-term competitiveness depends not only on a European Semiconductor Academy but on real mobility: short-cycle reskilling pathways, cross-border fellowships, industrial placements, and coordinated STEM-policy commitments. Talent leakage to non-EU markets will persist unless scale-up pathways are predictable and attractive. Finally, the Acts environmental and energy dimension requires clearer prioritisation. Semiconductor manufacturing is highly resource-intensive. The revision should strengthen circular-economy principles, green-lab standards, and efficient energy-use frameworks while ensuring that sustainability requirements do not inadvertently disadvantage SMEs. In summary, the Chips Act can deliver on Europes ambition if its revision deepens governance coherence, enables industrial participation across the full value chain, and strengthens trusted-partner alignment on resilience and security. I remain available to provide further analysis if helpful.",

These include, for example, the Society for Microelectronics, Microsystems and Precision Engineering (VDE GMM) and the Information Technology Society within the VDE (VDE ITG). Both professional associations VDE ITG and VDE GMM began addressing the topic of microelectronics at a very early stage. When the EU Commission was preparing the EU Chips Act 1.0, experts from the VDE network provided advice and support. The two VDE papers, Hidden Electronics II and III, provided impetus for the design of the EU Chips Act at the time. On September 2, 2025, the VDE presented its new paper Hidden Electronics IV at its annual summer reception in Brussels. The paper highlights areas where the EU Commission needs to take further action in order to build on the success of the EU Chip Act 1.0 with an EU Chip Act 2.0. The paper Hidden Electronics IV and the written contents of the VDE/EUREL European Future Technology Summit 2025 (EFTS 2025) with the title \"Europes Comeback: Microelectronics, Resilience and Future Technology under the EU Chips Act\" will be made the subject of the VDE as part of this consultation process.

    "feedback": "To support the development of artificial intelligence, data transfer must be significantly improved in both speed and energy efficiency. Traditional copper interconnects are highly energy-intensive and are approaching their physical and performance limits. While lasers are beginning to be deployed in data centers, they still face challenges related to power consumption and data density. MicroLED technology presents a promising alternative, with the potential to reduce power consumption by a factor of ten while significantly increasing data transfer density. As part of the Chips Act 2.0 initiative, we propose the inclusion of a strategic focus on innovative optoelectronic technologies for high-performance computing architectures dedicated to artificial intelligence. Aledia, a European pioneer in 3D MicroLEDs based on nanowires on silicon, aims to develop ultra-fast MicroLED arrays capable of transmitting data optically at very high frequencies between critical components such as GPUs and HBM modules in inter-chip configurations. This approach seeks to replace or complement traditional electrical interconnects within packages or boards, optimizing bandwidth, latency, and energy efficiency.",

Learning from Global Best Practices The Taiwan Example To strengthen Europes semiconductor competitiveness, we should learn from successful models such as Taiwans ecosystem, which demonstrates: 1. A complete and integrated value chain where SMEs play a vital role across design, manufacturing, and supply. 2. A business-driven innovation model, in contrast to Europes predominantly research-driven approach. 3. Direct government support to SMEs for technology development, talent retention, and industrial partnerships with large enterprises. 4. A practical, business- and innovation-oriented education system, whereas many EU students remain focused on academic recognition and dissemination. 5. Cost and production efficiency achieved through streamlined processes unlike the EUs growing administrative burden, with excessive focus on reporting, timesheets, and bureaucracy. B. SME Support and Monitoring Funding schemes should ensure that fund are primarily used for employing and retaining skilled personnel, rather than being consumed by administrative tasks, reporting requirements, and multiple meetings. C. Access to Funding for SMEs University and RTO-led spinoff/projects often secure funding more easily, while SMEs face significant barriers in accessing support, even in chip-related initiatives. Targeted mechanisms should be established to ensure fair and equitable access for SMEs. D. Clear Focus in Chip-Driven Calls Future CHIPS JU and ECS calls should provide clearer guidance and prioritization for semiconductor-focused projects, particularly to enable new fabless companies and practical industrial outcomes. from last 2years they are overly generic calls & dilute the impact on Europes strategic semiconductor goals. E. Streamline Consultancy-Based Support Remove all consultancy based support/program. This middle man just do bla-bla and ask SME to do the job. instead they should support and do work with SME, offering hands-on technical assistance, co-development, and practical implementation support.Funding should prioritize active contribution over administrative mediation to maximize efficiency and impact. F. Consolidate Clusters and Networks Under a Unified Framework The existing landscape of multiple clusters, centers, and initiatives is highly fragmented, often involving high membership fees and regional bias, which excludes many SMEs. A single, transparent umbrella framework (like amazon.com for shopping) should be established to coordinate all semiconductor-related services, funding access, and networking activities.

One of the unsolved problems in Europe in accessing the latest technology nodes is that we lack enough cutting edge designs that can justify the volume needed for the mayor markets (DC, automotive, connectivity). In other regions there is NVIDIA, Apple, Google, Bydance, Huawei among others that are delivering vertical solutions (and or horizonal platforms for several verticals). There is a great opportunity (and risk of not doing it) of combining data centre semiconductor infrastructure with the multiple verticals that can benefit from a centralise AI-farm and HPC compute that allows a continuous learning of Edge compute and Centralise compute. Robotaxi's (level 4) systems required high performance compute on the device and huge data center infrastructure for training (Telsa has publicly said that they are building a DC with 50K H100 GPUS for the sole propuse of training cars). This is the kind of initiatives that will enable enough synergies and economies of scale to have the latest technologies factories in EU. In terms of next-step we need to enable an infrastructure for the digital world with EU technology (SW and HW) which can be used to design in tandem with the Edge semiconductors (Automotive, Robotics, Wireless communications). We do not need to start with the most efficient but rather the most flexible architecture that enables a quick learning phase. This can be done by adapting DC architectures to the Edge devices. Getting enough funding to complement the amount of investment needed to get full commitment in this programs and applying DC technologies to EDGE will require a huge investment and partnering with the ecosystem. I understand that CHASSIS has been done differently by letting the OEM/Tier1 to manage the funding and subcontract as needed research but owning the outcome.",

This means (without claiming completeness): 1) \"easy and affordable\" access to pilot lines with feature sizes below 10nm to make it economically interesting for companies 2) integration of \"emerging devices\" (e.g. memristors, ferroelectric transistors, etc.) into the pilot line processes 3) continous transfer capability of explorative devices into pilot lines 4) PDK development efforts for such devices 5) library design and provision of certain functionalties with these devices for pilot lines 6) improvement of development workflows for such devices 7) Development of co-design workflows All this should lead to more extensive, esp. also HW realted research and transfer on future AI principles. BTW, this is in no way in competetion to the Quantum Computing efforts inside EU and should be seen as complemetary with target to make use of the European strengths in make use of new concepts and not \"brute force\" scaling.",

    "feedback": "The European Chip Act on itself was good initiative and showing already nice result as beside EU funding, also already it attracted in a few years billions of third parties investments. But by just funding Chip / Semiconductor industry it will not reduce reliance on Asia in full meaning. To build solid resilience in Europe for these formerly named industries, all supply chain should considered, especially PCB and EMS. 1. Customs duty European PCB manufacturers must pay customs duty on base materials that they import. These are not produced in the EU in the required variety or quantity. At the same time, however, PCBs ordered and produced in China and imported into the EU are exempt from customs duties. This very unfair competition and killing our own European PCB industry that is already for years now under heavy pressure. To reduce this competitive disadvantage, base materials for PCB production must be exempt from customs duties. This involves the following customs tariff numbers: - 7410210090 - copper clad laminates (duty rate: 5.2%) - 3921905590 rolls of epoxy resin impregnated glass fibres (prepregs) (6.5%) - 70197300000 - FR4 prepreg (5.0%) - 74091900000 - copper clad epoxy impregnated glass fabric(4.8%) - 7410 1100 400 - copper clad simple laminates (5.2%) - 70196100290 -non-clad laminate (7.0%). 2. Incentives to support PCB industry In 2021, the US agreed on the H.R.4346 - CHIPS and Science Act This act is providing $52,7 billion in manufacturing grants and research investments and establish a 25% investment tax credit (ITC) to incentivize semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. As this act is only supporting semi-conductor / chip industry, also in 2022 established the supporting PCB act : H.R.7677 - Supporting American Printed Circuit Boards Act of 2022. This bill provides incentives to bolster domestic printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing, research, and development to reduce supply chain disruptions, address national security concerns related to foreign PCB production, and enhance America's economic leadership. The bill establishes a financial assistance program modelled on the CHIPS Act within the Commerce Department for American facilities manufacturing or researching PCBs; provides a 25% tax credit for entities that purchase American manufactured PCBs; requires a Presidential determination for single financial awards over $300 million; includes waste, fraud, and abuse protections; and authorizes appropriations of $3 billion to carry out the program. In Europe, the EU started with European Chip act, 43 billion to support the European Chip / Semiconductor Industry up to 2030. But everyone is forgetting that for Semiconductor as well as Chips, you always need to have a PCB as a carrier. It doesn't make sense to spend billions of Euros for European Chip Act and still buying the PCB to mount the device on from China, especially not for critical industry sectors like Aerospace, Defence and Security. 3. Intellectual Property Still, for defence and security, aerospace and avionics as well as industrial automation and medical industry, Europe has a growing demand for high-end PCB's. Companies that buy PCB in China urgently have to consider that when sending over Gerber files ( digital PCB production files ), it is extremely easy to copy them. Most politicians and also majority of the companies that ordering in China have absolutely no clue about what is going on in China and for sure are not aware of the risk sending digital data to Chinese manufacturers. Just 2 reminders from the Communist Party 30 year plan : - Deploying the world's best-armed forces no later than 2049. - Become global IOT leader by 2035 So in the European PCB industry, there is a strong suspect that digital PCB production data are copied in a massive way when produced in Chinese factories.",

    "feedback": "TS PCB, a Polish manufacturer of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB), strongly supports the European Unions ambition, articulated within the European Chips Act, to bolster technological sovereignty, security, and resilience in the semiconductor supply chain. The pursuit of enhanced European manufacturing capacity is vital for economic security. However, we must raise a critical and specific concern regarding the scope of the Act: the exclusion of the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing sector from its core strategic definitions and support mechanisms. A Technical and Legal Gap in Scope The current framework of the European Chips Act primarily channels support through measures defined under Pillar 2, focusing on the establishment of 'First-of-a-Kind' and 'Integrated Production Facilities (IPFs)' or 'Open EU Foundries (OEFs)'. This core legislative focus defines the scope of strategic support and priority too narrowly. Narrow Definition of 'Integration': By concentrating investment and regulatory efforts almost exclusively on semiconductor fabrication (wafer level) and advanced packaging technologies, the Act fails to account for the crucial interconnection layer necessary to make any chip functional. The PCB is the indispensable physical and electrical foundation that enables the integration of chips into any final electronic system. Exclusion of Critical Enablers: The PCB manufacturing sector, which provides the critical substrate and interconnection technology for all IPFs and OEFs to be practically operationalized, is effectively excluded from these strategic definitions. This creates a literal supply chain gap: we may secure the silicon chip, but if the substrate (the PCB) must still be sourced from vulnerable non-EU supply chains, the goal of true end-to-end resilience is not met. The Threat to Supply Chain Security Ignoring the PCB sector introduces a significant vulnerability that fundamentally undermines the Acts primary objective: Incomplete Resilience: The PCB becomes the unprotected critical bottleneck. Achieving high volumes of European-made chips provides no strategic advantage if their deployment is limited by the availability, quality, and security of corresponding European-made advanced PCB substrates (such as High-Density Interconnect - HDI, and complex multilayer boards). Technological Alignment: Investment in cutting-edge semiconductor nodes requires parallel investment in advanced PCB manufacturing to handle the high density and signal integrity requirements. A gap in the European PCB sector will directly inhibit the effective uptake and integration of the very advanced chips the Act aims to promote. Concrete Recommendation TS PCB urges the European Commission and the co-legislators to formally expand the definitions and scope of support under the European Chips Act 2 to explicitly include the Advanced Printed Circuit Board manufacturing industry. This expansion must ensure that: PCB manufacturing facilities producing advanced substrates are recognized as strategic, 'first-of-a-kind' enablers of the European electronics ecosystem. Funding and regulatory mechanisms are available to stimulate R&D and significant capacity expansion in complex, high-reliability PCB technologies within the EU. A secure European semiconductor supply chain is impossible without a secure, advanced European PCB supply chain. We appeal to the European Commission to close this critical technical and legislative gap.",

    "feedback": "Europes competitiveness and technological resilience depend on keeping pace with the fast-evolving semiconductor landscape. Technology Industries of Finland urges the EU to act with urgency in its chips policy so that implementation matches global developments and delivers a systemic, forward-looking strategy that consolidates strengths, tackles dependencies, reflects and catalyses demand and aligns EU and national action. Our key asks are: 1) Excellence-based funding and market demand Create a dedicated semiconductor budget of critical mass under the next MFF within the European Competitiveness Fund and align it with national and private funding. Prioritise high-growth and strategic areas such as chip design (e.g. Edge AI and 6G chips based on EUV technology), MEMS/sensors, photonics, quantum chips, advanced materials and process innovations (e.g. atomic layer deposition). Funding must follow excellence and global leadership potential. Expand First-of-a-Kind facilities to upstream chemicals and materials and to downstream assembly, testing and packaging, and include quantum chip fabrication. Design Centres of Excellence should have a clear definition and a broadened scope that includes startups, SMEs and large companies working on state-of-the-art chip design, architecture and Electronic Design Automation tools. Catalyse industry-led alliances that connect chip providers with end users to secure early adoption and anchor demand in sectors such as automotive, telecoms and energy. Ensure the upcoming IPCEI on Advanced Semiconductor Technologies reinforces design excellence, streamlines procedures and keeps a level playing field for established champions and emerging innovators. 2) R&D and innovation hubs Ensure strong funding for the chips sector under the next EU R&D framework programme. Launch a semiconductor stream under the EU Tech Frontrunners model to fund company-led programmes with SMEs, startups and research partners. Establish chip innovation hubs that integrate pilot lines and the EU design platform, supported by Chips Competence Centres, and industry clusters. Continue funding pilot lines and consider hosting a 300 mm line at Finlands VTT focused on mircoelectronics for dual-use applications. Sustain Europes leadership in quantum chip technologies by building on Chips JU pilot lines and integrating them into the hubs with long-term support. 3) Skills and mobility Strengthen the talent pipeline with industry-aligned programmes via Erasmus+, Digital Europe, Horizon Europe and the European Social Fund. Create a dedicated EU Tech Talent Visa to simplify and harmonise entry for experts and scientists and to support cross-border mobility. 4) Green manufacturing Direct R&D funding to high-impact green technologies such as energy-efficient production, water conservation, recyclable and sustainable materials, circularity and safer substances, including material substitution and advanced recycling that reduce strategic dependencies. Support chips that enable the green transition such as integrated photonics and renewable energy applications. 5) International partnerships Deepen cooperation with like-minded partners including the US, Japan, Korea and Taiwan through co-investments, joint ventures and access to EU-funded R&D infrastructures, guided by open strategic autonomy. Use bilateral and multilateral platforms such as Trade and Technology Councils to align policies and strengthen resilient supply chains. 6) Governance and coherence Reinforce the European Semiconductor Board with real coordinating powers and a consolidated view of EU and national investments. Give the Industrial Alliance on Semiconductors, alongside other representative bodies, a structured advisory role. Focus on alignment and efficiency rather than new reporting. Ensure coherence with related initiatives such as the Quantum Act and Advanced Materials Act. More detailed recommendations are provided in the attached position paper.",

    "feedback": "Nemôžem sa zbaviť pocitu, že téma Chips Act 1 sa stala skôr politickou a akademickou témou s minimálnymi reálnymi výstupmi. Napriek rozsiahlej legislatíve sa do roku 2025 nepodarilo zvýšiť podiel EU v produkcii čipov v porovnaní s ostatným svetom ani o 1%. Zaostávanie sa skôr prehlbuje. Pritom sa o podpore výroby čipov rozpráva už relatívne dlhú dobu. Podľa Výzvy na predkladanie podkladov... viedol Akt o čipoch, ktorý je účinný od septembra 2023, už k ohláseným investíciám do výrobných kapacít vo výške viac ako 80 miliárd EUR. To je relatívne veľká čiastka, ale zatiaľ sa to však nijako neprejavilo v dobiehaní Ázie či aspoň USA v tejto oblasti. Navyše sa zdá že niektoré z projektov sa termínovo posunuli alebo dokonca zrušili. V celom legislatívnom a administratívnom reťazci chýbajú konkrétne opatrenie a ciele, ktoré by boli kvantifikovateľné a v jednotlivých časových úsekoch vyhodnotiteľné. Rovnako tak chýba definovanie zodpovednosti a následné vyvodenie dôsledkov za neplnenie ukazovateľov. Čo je však nemenej dôležité, tak to je skutočnosť, že samotné čipy sú nepoužiteľné bez ich inštalácie na dosky s plošnými spojmi (Printed Circuit Boards PCB´s ). Čipy nebudú plávať vo vzduchu a ich vstupy a výstupy nebudú prepojené svetelnými vodičmi. Musia byť prispájkované na dosku s plošnými spojmi (PCB), kde medené vodiče zabezpečia napájanie čipov a prepojenie vývodov (kontaktov čipov) s ostatnými elektronickými komponentami tak, aby vytvorili jeden funkčný elektronický celok. Bez kvalitných plošných spojov je zbytočné riešiť samotné čipy. Podobne aj platný Chip Act prijatý v USA je nasledovaný legislatívnou normou známou ako PCB´s Act, ktorú krátko po schválení Chip Act predložil do kongresu na schválenie kongresman Blake Moore. Američania si takto uvedomili strategický význam práve PCB´s a tiež vysokú závislosť v oblasti dodávok PCB´s z Číny. Práve výroba PCB´s je v celej EU v katastrofálnom stave. Ešte v roku 2000 pôsobilo v krajinách, ktoré dnes tvoria EU viac ako 610 výrobcov PCB´s. zatiaľ čo v roku 2025 klesol tento počet na úroveň 188 výrobcov. A každým rokom sa tento stav znižuje. Ak teda nevložíme do Chip Act 2 aj tému podpory výroby PCB´s, tak naša závislosť od Číny v oblasti výroby elektroniky ako takej sa iba prehĺbi. To platí tak pre oblasť spotrebnej elektroniky ako aj pre elektroniku určenú pre strategický vojenský, letecký, kozmický, automobilový ale napríklad aj medicínsky priemysel. Veľmi aktuálne je napríklad zrušenie dovozných ciel na základné materiály (prípadne aj zavedenie dovozných ciel na PCB importované z Ďalekého východu). Strategicky je tiež dôležité legislatívne zakotviť, aby sa obranné a iné strategicky dôležité produkty vyrábali výhradne s európskymi doskami plošných spojov (PCB´s). Alebo chceme aj naďalej poskytovať tretím krajinám naše patentované riešenia a Know How tak že im poskytneme kompletnú technickú dokumentáciu na výrobu PCB´s, ich osadenie a dokonca aj oživenie? Chips Act 2 nemôže byť iba nejakou politickou deklaráciou, ale musí to byť veľmi vážna téma pre odbornú diskusiu, ktorej cieľom majú byť výstupy, ktoré v krátkej dobe bude možné aplikovať v praxi tak, aby sme aspoň prestali zaostávať ale hlavne, aby sme dokázali aspoň v definovaných oblastiach dosiahnuť čo najväčšiu samostatnosť a teda aj nezávislosť od dodávok akýchkoľvek elektronických komponentov z Ázie. Politici ako aj Komisia by sa mala teda obrátiť napr. na odborníkov z IPC (mimochodom mali by mať na tento účel už zriadenú kanceláriu priamo v Bruseli), alebo napr. aj na také organizácie ako sú napr. ZVEI e. V., the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association, ktorá má tiež kanceláriu v Bruseli.",

    "feedbackTextUserLanguage": "I cannot get out of the feeling that Chips Act 1 has become a political and academic topic with minimal real outcomes. Despite extensive legislation, the EU’s share of chip production by 2025 has not even increased by 1 % compared to the rest of the world. Backwardness tends to widen. At the same time, support for chip production has been discussed for a relatively long time. According to the Call for Evidence..., the Chips Act, in force since September 2023, has already led to over EUR 80 billion of announced investment in production capacity. This is a relatively large amount, but this has not yet been reflected in the catching-up of Asia or at least the US in this area. Moreover, some of the projects seem to have been delayed or even cancelled. Throughout the legislative and administrative chain, there is a lack of concrete action and targets that are quantifiable and measurable at different points in time. Similarly, there is no definition of responsibility and consequential consequences for non-compliance with the indicators. However, what is no less important is the fact that the chips themselves are unusable without being installed on printed circuit boards (Printed Circuit Boards PCBs). Chips will not fly in the air and their inputs and outputs will not be connected by light conductors. They shall be soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB) where copper conductors ensure that the chips are powered and the outlets (chip contacts) are connected to other electronic components to form a single functional electronic unit. Without quality printed circuits, it is unnecessary to deal with chips themselves. Similarly, the existing Chip Act adopted in the US is followed by a legislative standard known as the PCBs Act, which was submitted to Congress by Blake Moore for approval shortly after the Chip Act was approved. In this way, the Americans realised both the strategic importance of PCBs and the high dependence on the supply of PCBs from China. It is the production of PCBs in a catastrophic state throughout the EU. Still in 2000, there were more than 610 PCB producers in countries that make up the EU today, while in 2025 this number fell to 188 producers. And this is decreasing every year. Therefore, if we do not include in Chip Act 2 the topic of support for PCBs production, our dependence on China for the production of electronics as such will only increase. This applies both to consumer electronics and to electronics intended for strategic military, aerospace, automotive and, for example, the medical industry. For example, the abolition of import duties on basic materials (possibly the introduction of import duties on PCBs imported from the Far East) is very timely. It is also strategically important to legislate that defence and other strategically important products are produced exclusively with European printed circuit boards (PCBs). Or do we want to continue to provide our patented solutions to third countries and Know How by providing them with complete technical documentation for the production, installation and even recovery of PCBs? The Chips Act 2 cannot be a mere political declaration, but must be a very serious topic for expert debate, aiming at outputs that can be applied in practice in the short term so that we are at least left behind, but above all, so that we can achieve the greatest possible autonomy and thus independence from the supply of any electronic components from Asia, at least in defined areas. Politicians as well as the Commission should therefore contact e.g. IPC experts (by way of example, they should already have an office directly in Brussels for this purpose) or, for example, organisations such as ZVEI e.V., the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers’ Association, which also has an office in Brussels.",

    "feedback": "It is said in the call for evidence document, the demand for 10nm or less nodes chips is limited. On the contrary, there is a great need for facilities that could manufacture small and medium size series at competitive cost. By \"manufacture\", I mean all the value chain, from lithography to packaging and metrology. By \"chips\", I mean microelectronics but also all the diversity of microphotonics i.e. PICs, copackaged optics, metasurfaces, material processing, waveguides etc. Photonic microdevices are much more diverse than microelectronic chips. By \"small and medium size series\", I mean all those chips needed in applications like medical, industry, industrial gas sensing, etc. where the series are from few hundreds to some hundred thousand but less than millions. These application markets are where Europe is still competitive. There is a great need for 1. research 2. pilot lines 3. start-ups and companies active in fabrication, automation, metrology, digital twin etc. aiming to develop those versatile manufacturing technologies than lower dramatically the cost of small and medium size series. And there is of course a great need of companies to run those versatile plants and facilities. But in order to do it, there is a lack of people experienced in running such facilities: engineers, technicians, operators. These people exist and work in big plants of Malaysia etc. I receive a lot of candidacies of people having such experience and wishing to come in Europe. A specific program to facilitate their venue would be very efficient along with a training program that could ask them to share their knowledge to European young engineers. Another great concern for me is the ownership of companies. A study we made in 2022 showed that 14% of the PIC companies were owned by non-European investors. 14% is not that big but is terms of revenue it represented 27% total revenue in the Netherlands, 43% in Germany and 15% in France. We need to mobilize private investors and show them that this industry is growing and will grow for long.",

However, no appropriate funding instruments were implemented in the last Chips Act. Generally, the Chips Act did not serve as a supporting instrument to bring novel supporting- & enabling-technologies to practical application, like, e.g. photonic measurement technologies in the field of NDT, metrology, characterization, monitoring & sensing. There should be dedicated budget streams reserved to invite RTOs to implement and demonstrate novel supporting- & enabling-technologies in the fab. Especially, the transfer from lab to fab shall be enabled for photonic metrology, testing, monitoring, sensing and characterization technologies - for wafer-level processes or for chip-level structures.",

That used to work for the established businesses and research institutions. In the future, that has to change to lower the entry threshold for the private research organizations. I can't see any signs of change to that in the forthcoming regulations. Ironically, it is easier to access Canadian and US-based resources in that respect.

    "feedback": "Less focus on the % of manufacturing in Europe and more on 'Control Point': products by European companies based on European technology (and infrastructure and ecosystem of suppliers, etc.) that are indispensable in international value chains. We have two kinds of this: First, existing strengths, which can be in chip manufacturing but equally well in equipment (ASML) or materials (Soitec). Make sure these are strengthened, supported, and will stay European. Secondly, focus on topics where we can built such new strengths. Which again can be in equipment (Nearfield Instruments), chips (new AI chips?), quantum technologies, or manufacturing (Infineon, NXP,...). This doesn't necessarily makes the European portfolio a complete value chain, but will give more power in intercontinental geo-economics. More focus on what makes Europe unique as well: RTO's. RTO's play a key role in supporting our control points (TNO for ASML, CEA for STM, FhG for Infineon, etc.), while also pushing and nudging existing industry towards sustainability and continued innovation. RTO's are also essential to develop new control points: their spin-offs have (although lower in number) often higher impact and chance of unicorn status than spin-offs from universities, and in this way we work on 'constructive destruction' (before USA based companies attack European control points). This requires some investments, though, as RTO's have to have some power to work on innovations where existing control point might not be too supportive on. The JU model with the funding coming 50/50% from Europe and member states makes the system vulnerable to misalignment; perhaps Europe could take a more powerful position here. Although not a specialist in chip design, I believe it is worth investing in. It is often the start of new value chains or powerful positions. It creates to 'pull' for manufacturing sites, too. Equally important: anything that helps to come to one single European internal market (regulation, financing, etc.) which allows European companies to sell their products to all of Europe!",

    "feedback": "1. Semiconductor industry needs investments to stay in the game.They are today the base of our wealth and liberty. Investments mean public funding but also private funding. Private investors need to have confidence in the payback of their investments, in a convincing business case and an overall strategy. That is missing in Europe at the moment. 2. Chips Act 1.0 has adressed technologies and components, maybe subsystems. But this approach has reached its limits. In the definition of strategic roadmaps, final customers are very rarely involved. This is different in China. We here in Europe need to take China as the example for strategic thinking and copy the right measure, e.g. the creation of an IP portal for RISC-V IP. The next Chips Act must take into account the final markets. A cross industry initiative like the KET initiative must bring together the semiconductor industry AND their customers and define together the right measures to strengthen the full supply chain up to the automotive, aerospace pharmaceutical or industrial final customer, create synergies, but also committment from the customers. A gap analysis needs to be performed to make sure the customers get what they need. We have seen this in individual cases that the partnership between a semiconductor company and a final customer creates the difference. 3. We must be conscious that a revolution is ongoing. There is no longer the opinion of the experts explaining that something is not feasible, but today the game changers fix a (sometimes unthinkable) target and the experts have to find a way to get there. The process is very strongly moving from a technology push to a user pull. It thus also needs a progressive and strong governance that can lead this revolution. 4. Another point is the separation between military and civil research. This needs to be abandonned. Very valuable innovations have been created very often in the military area to then move into civil applications. Europe needs to profit from it like we see it in the USA or Israel. 5. There is a need to create an environment of rules that allow european industry to work tighter together to win markets together. The competition is not inside Europe, but between Europe, the US and China. The competition law needs to reflect this new situation and allow e.g. the implementation of collaboration projects with much more agility.(less administration) 6. Protect your inventions and standardise them. Every R&D project talks about it, but in the realisation it is very inefficient. There needs to be a specific focus on IP and standards. 6. Despite the political and commercial pressure, we must not forget the planet, the climate, the resources and the people. In developping new technologies, we must make sure that everyone understands and accepts the new developments. If we loose the link to parts of the population, we will put the environment in danger. Conclusion: This all calls for a stronger Chips Act that improves the shortcomings of the first one.",

    "feedback": "The extension of EU funding under Horizon Europe and InvestEU guarantees presents a significant opportunity for Indian companies to engage in joint R&D projects on next-generation chip architectures and process technologies. Indian design houses with proven expertise in analog and mixed-signal IP development are well-positioned to contribute to EU-led microelectronics research consortia, provided funding mechanisms explicitly facilitate non-EU participation and co-funding arrangements. However, for Indian firms, the concern we see is regarding the environmental compliance requirements embedded in Chips Act 2. Mandated lifecycle carbon assessments and stringent water-usage reduction targets will necessitate substantial investments in cleaner manufacturing processes and advanced effluent treatment systems. To ensure Indian suppliers can compete, the Commission should consider transitional support or capacity-building grants for technology upgrades aligned with EU Green Deal objectives. Security and supply chain transparency measures under the Act, such as compulsory cybersecurity certifications for chip design and production are welcome as it aims to demonstrate highest standards of trustworthiness. Nonetheless, the administrative burden and cost of achieving EU-recognised certifications may pose barriers for SMEs. EICBI recommends establishing simplified certification pathways and mutual recognition agreements that acknowledge equivalent Indian standards to avoid duplication and reduce time-to-market. Lastly, the anticipated demand for skilled engineers and designers in the EU semiconductor ecosystem underscores the need for collaborative workforce development initiatives. Indian firms stand ready to participate in exchange programmes, internships, and joint training curricula with the European Chips Skills Academy to build a talent pipeline capable of meeting Chips Act 2 priorities. EICBI encourages the Commission to formalise India-EU skills partnerships, including remote and in-person modules, to mitigate the projected shortage of 350,000 professionals by 2030.",

We want to have the next Nvidia, not (only?) the next TSMC... - We should invest more in academic research in close (and real) collaboration with EU companies. Do not think that this collaboration automatically comes from investing in large research institutes. They work less with local industry. You need a widely distributed network of industry and researchers, with a lot of mutual exchange of personnel (transferring from one entity to another, e.g. a PhD students then starting a job in a company) and ideas.

However Presto for instance cannot convert project into ASIC since the bar is raised high by the supply chain for our Customers in this market. On the opposite we consider that enough emphasis has been put on public-research, or non profit entities with pilot lines (like IMEC or CEA, or Fraunhofer) since - particularly IMEC - the commercial incentive is producing then a bias in competition terms on the market. Regarding priority the sector of photonic testing (where europe is strong) shall be architecture around a leadership test facilities with equipment makers. Not having an european outsourced assembly and test player ecosytem in Europe (and not a non european player installing factories) is always a worry vs. independence of supply.",

Almae management is very experienced in the field with a technical background coming from Alcatel and Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs. Our product range covers transceivers chips (discrete and integrated lasers) for Telecom and Datacom networks with state-of-the-art performances compared to market leader Lumentum products. Almae has already captured about 10% of the Telecom products (at chip level) market share worldwide, thanks to partnership with Chinese integrators, and is actively engaged with E.S.TEL from Belgium to build an alternative European supply chain. Our technology differentiation is based on a deep understanding of III-V structure design and material growth, Epitaxy being key for Photonics as Lithography is for EICs. These differentiating factors will give Almae a strong position is the next generation of transceiver chips which will rely on InP integration on SOI wafers to enhance Silicon with various photonic functions. Integration of InP on Silicon in the form of chiplets will play a key role in future interconnect technology for Artificial Intellignece. Almae is a key member of Chips-JU project Starlight and is in partnership with innovators worldwide. In addition, we strongly believe, together with ST CEO J-M Chery, in a necessary end-to-end control of the supply-chain. In our case, high-volume Epitaxy know-how and equipment, as well as Indium Phosphide wafers manufacturing and recycling, are critical control points for the future. We strongly believe that InP technology along with InP integration with Si-Photonics, hybrid integration, and CMOS-Photonics, wafer level monolithic integration, will give Europe a unique and clear chance to regain a leading position in the connectivity market space, especially for AI and HPC clusters, as well as create new opportunities in the consumer market space. The time has come for a shift in ambition to set in place a First-of-a-Kind facility giving Almae and partners the opportunity to scale business and lead the market. The initiative should be clearly market oriented and industrially driven with support from RTOs to prepare an aligned roadmap. For now, we have seen the reverse strategy which is pushing the market introduction to far in time. In this respect, a targeted amendment to the Chips Act, bringing forward the strategic nature of the initiative would be preferable. Scale of the manufacturing facility to be built should be targeted to take over at least 1/3 of the worldwide market at stake, well above the EU needs to build a leadership position for Europe. Such a project is reasonable and doable considering the existing skills and an estimated overall budget of less the 1 B over 2026-2030, to be compared to the investment level needed to catch-up for advanced semiconductor nodes.",

    "feedback": "Photonics is one of the fastest-growing enabling technologies in Europe. In Finland, the photonics industry grows by about 12% annually, and similar rates are seen elsewhere. As electronics approach their physical limits, photonics becomes indispensable: it offers the means to sustain Moores law and overcome Shannons limit, enabling faster, more energy-efficient data transfer and processing. This makes photonics not just supportive, but central to Europes long-term technological sovereignty. Photonics already underpins many strategic sectors. It enables autonomous vehicles, dual-use and defense solutions, advanced healthcare, renewable energy, and quantum technologies. In quantum computing, communication, and sensing, photonics is a core element without which these breakthroughs cannot materialize. Ensuring strong photonics capabilities in Europe is therefore essential to secure competitiveness and resilience in these fields. The current Chips Act pilot lines and facilities provide valuable support for the automotive and mainstream semiconductor sectors. However, the specific needs of photonics are underrepresented. Unlike traditional microelectronics, the photonics sector is largely driven by SMEs and start-ups, often located outside capital regions. Well-known clusters exist in Joensuu (Finland), Jena (Germany), Grenoble (France), and other mid-sized cities. To fully unlock this distributed expertise, pilot lines for photonics should also be geographically distributed. This would ensure that each Member States know-how benefits the whole Union, and that companies can access services close to their ecosystems. There are several critical gaps in existing pilot line coverage that need to be filled: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Polymers as a cost-efficient and lightweight material platform, especially important for defense. Antimonide (Sb)-based materials for mid-infrared applications, including epitaxy, lasers, and detectors. Glass and specialty fibers for advanced photonic integration, interconnections, and light control. Solution-based solar cells for soft, flexible, and low-cost renewable energy technologies. In addition, Europe must invest in Optical Circuit Boards (OCBs) to manage photons in complex systems. This includes light coupling, transmission, splitting, and modulation, relying on innovative optics (micro/nano-optics, diffractive and freeform optics, meta-optics, 2D materials, waveguides). Such innovations will be vital for hybrid photonicelectronic integration. Photonics devices components that generate, manipulate, or detect light already play a vital role in communications, imaging, energy, security, and healthcare. Their importance will grow further with the rise of quantum technologies, which rely heavily on photonics for functionality. Examples of innovations that could be accelerated with dedicated pilot line support include: High-speed modulators based on thin-film LiNbO3 (TFLN) for hybrid PICs. Smart chip holders introducing standards for full-optical and opto-electronic integration, allowing new levels of signal mixing and material use. Biomedical photonic chips for advanced diagnostics and health monitoring. To remain competitive, the EU must recognize photonics as a core pillar of the semiconductor ecosystem. By creating dedicated and distributed pilot lines, Europe would strengthen its SME-driven innovation base, reduce strategic dependencies, and ensure that photonics continues to power the next generation of semiconductor, quantum, and digital technologies.",

Europe is at a critical point: or it leads the next technological wave or is relegated to strategic dependence. Quantum symbiotic technologies are not just an efficiency leap; they form the basis for a new digital civilisation capable of redefining work, education, health, defence and sovereignty. The EU should establish a funding framework that supports basic research and also practical applications with a direct impact on society and the economy. 1. Priority areas cyber defence and digital sovereignty. CCNS and IANSCS enable cybersecurity with quantum encryption, advanced blockchain and threat prediction. Preventive quantum health. Symbiotic AI to anticipate outbreaks, customise diagnostics and move towards predictive medicine. Energy and climate resilience. Simulating how much symbiotic to optimise networks and storage, reducing emissions. Immersive education. Virtual classrooms and European educational avatars, strengthening their own cultural ecosystems. 2. Strategic recommendations 1. Targeted funding. Specific Horizon Europe lines for quantum symbiotic AI and sub-atomic computing. 2. First-of-a-kind regulatory framework. Anticipate with ethical and transparent legislation on AI 6a Gen. 3. European consortia. Public-private partnerships between SMEs, universities and state bodies. 4. Protection of strategic patents. Rapid European mechanisms to ensure sovereignty. 5. Sovereign infrastructure. Their own quantum servers and secure photonic networks. 3. Multi-sectoral impact symbiotic defence and climate resilience. AI-based hybrid security and quantum modelling. Economy and Employment. New productive sectors and skilled jobs around quantum AI. Society and culture. Preservation of collective memory and European cultural metaverses. 4. As regards our documentation, Spain has already been sent and validated in official bodies, consolidating the Spanish State as a de facto guarantor of these disruptive innovations. Spain has a strategic role and it is time to project it into the European framework. — Conclusion: well-targeted innovation not only finances projects: it ensures technological sovereignty, social resilience and European leadership. The European Commission has the opportunity to put the EU at the forefront of the quantum symbiotic revolution, integrating CCNS and IANSCS into the 20252030 strategic agenda.

    "feedback": "The Chips Act (CA1) could achieve greater impact if it considered a broader spectrum of industry domains in its funding approach. 1. Balanced Industry Coverage :While the automotive sector has rightly been given high priority, other strategically important domains such as AI, Energy, and Robotics also deserve stronger attention. A more balanced allocation would ensure that Europe maintains competitiveness across all critical sectors. 2. Focus of ECS: Calls At present, only one ECS call is dedicated specifically to semiconductors, while the majority address systems, value chains, and pilot-related topics. Increasing the number of semiconductor-focused calls would strengthen the core objective of the Chips Act. 3. Role of RTOs: Significant resources have been allocated to RTOs for technologies that may only reach maturity in 4-7 years, addressing a relatively small portion of the semiconductor market. Furthermore, a considerable share of this funding is consumed by high personnel costs. Introducing reasonable salary caps for professors and researchers could help direct more funds toward technology development and industrial impact. 4. Support for SMEs: SMEs are the backbone of innovation but face a unique challenge: unlike RTOs, which may specialize in one domain of the value chain, SMEs often need to cover the entire spectrumfrom specification, chip design, and PCB development to testing. This requires broad expertise and significant resources. Stronger, tailored support for SMEs is essential, as their survival depends on achieving successful designs; failure or underperformance cannot simply be absorbed as it might be in larger organizations. 5. Expertise and Evaluation: The evaluation/review of CA1 projects could benefit from fresh perspectives. Previous approaches often set unrealistic targets, creating unnecessary risks for smaller participants. A new panel of experts, with meaningful SME representation, would help ensure that targets are both ambitious and achievable. SMEs, who take on the greatest risks, must be adequately represented in decision-making. Meanwhile, larger MNCs, whose focus is often on stock market performance and leadership positioning, should be balanced with input from those driving innovation at the grassroots level. 6. Enhanced Support for Intellectual Property (IP): SMEs should be provided with additional financial support to file patents. This would encourage innovation, strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs, and enable them to better withstand global cost pressures, particularly from countries such as China. (For example, we incurred costs of approximately 29,000 to file patents in Austria and the United States, while the support received was limited to around 6,000. This gap makes it difficult for us to pursue further protection of our innovations. As a result, we are currently discouraged from filing a patent on our breakthrough work in 3D imaging with depth estimation, a technology with significant potential for robotics and machine vision.) 7. Equal Participation in All Projects: SMEs should have the opportunity to participate in every type of project including IPCEI and pilot lines on the same footing as other institutes and organizations. This ensures that their expertise and innovative capacity are fully integrated into the European semiconductor ecosystem. 8. Dedicated Budget Allocation for SMEs: To generate quality jobs and support grassroots innovation, a minimum of 30% of the budget in all EC-funded projects should be allocated to SMEs. For ECS projects, this allocation should be increased to at least 50%. Such measures would ensure that SMEs receive the support necessary to contribute meaningfully while also maintaining a healthy and diverse European innovation landscape.",

    "feedback": "I would like to add that the EU can create demand for such commercial foundry by using tariffs on the end-products carrying those chips. Trump's reasoning that subsidies don't work so well but tariffs do for bringing home industries is correct and it's more affordable because it's money coming in rather than money going out. Another tool one could consider is a form of yield insurance that would stimulate competition from TSMC (Samsung, Intel) to set down in the EU because they in turn can attract more clients as the EU covers bad yields. That insurance will help those foundry competitors to develop and improve their tooling over time to the point they no longer need yield insurance. One could look at the economics of Samsung foundry and Intel foundry and find levers to help them break TSMC's market dominance.",

    "feedback": "I would like to add that it's not just the chips itself but also the PCB's. High-frequency radio hardware requires special, more suitable PCBs, such as electronic warfare systems, 5G systems, phased arrays,... From my understanding only the US and China have such PCB manufacturing at the moment and it has large backlogs to order (6 months). The act probably needs extending to incorporate industries vital to national security. Then, I would urge the EU to consider export restrictions on the latest ASML factory equipment to force the world to build those plants here if they absolutely want the smallest chips. This breeds dependency on EU trade links but also guarantees Europe has the latest technology. For this, those could be added to export restricted materials and export licenses could be denied if no such foundry exists in the EU. This assumes that ASML's technology edge is a defacto monopoly, which I am not sure is the case. As for state-aid, I think the EU should consider developing a sovereign wealth fund like the US is developing now and Norway already has that manages investments at arms-length but can execute mandates given to it by states through subfunds. Having it managed at EU level ensures a level playing field inside Europe and I don't believe we care about outside Europe at this point. The other advantage of this is that revenue from such investments can be recycled in the fund and government capture by industry is mooted as such revenue would not flow into the state budgets again. Such a fund can be an equity investor also, rather than providing grants/subsidies.",
